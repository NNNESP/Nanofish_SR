AB  - The potential transfer of microplastics (MPs) between vertebrates belonging to the same taxonomic group, and the impact of such a transfer on higher trophic levels remains little explored. An experimental food chain with two fish species was installed to test the hypothesis that polyethylene MPs (PE MPs) can accumulate in animals and cause behavioral, mutagenic and cytotoxic changes at upper trophic levels. Poecilia reticulata fry were exposed to MPs for 48 h and, subsequently, offered (as food) to Danio rerio adults for 10 days to simulate an upper level food chain. PE MPs quantification in fry and in different Danio rerio tissues evidenced their accumulation at the two assessed trophic levels. This finding suggested their absorption, adherence and translocation from one organism to another. The accumulation seen in D. rerio directly exposed to MPs was associated with behavioral disorders at upper trophic level. These animals presented behavior suggestive of anti-predatory response deficit when they were confronted with a potential aquatic predator (Geophagus brasiliensis). This finding was inferred through lower school cohesion, shallower school depth and shorter distance from the potential predator. In addition, animals exposed to MPs recorded higher nuclear abnormality rates and changes in the size and shape of erythrocytes and in their nuclei; this outcome has suggested mutagenic and cytotoxic effects, respectively. Based on the current results, MPs are transferred through a food chain that only involves two vertebrates. MPs enter the vertebrates' organs, change their behavior and induce mutagenic and cytotoxic processes in animals, which can cause significant ecological consequences in freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are a ubiquitous pollutant detected not only in marine and freshwater bodies, but also in tap and bottled water worldwide. While MPs have been extensively studied, the toxicity of their smaller counterpart, nanoplastics (NPs), is not well documented. Despite likely large-scale human and animal exposure to NPs, the associated health risks remain unclear, especially during early developmental stages. To address this, we investigated the health impacts of exposures to both 50 and 200 nm polystyrene NPs in larval zebrafish. From 6 to 120 h post-fertilization (hpf), developing zebrafish were exposed to a range of fluorescent NPs (10-10,000 parts per billion). Dose-dependent increases in accumulation were identified in exposed larval fish, potentially coinciding with an altered behavioral response as evidenced through swimming hyperactivity. Notably, exposures did not impact mortality, hatching rate, or deformities; however, transcriptomic analysis suggests neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction at both high and low concentrations. Furthermore, results of this study suggest that NPs can accumulate in the tissues of larval zebrafish, alter their transcriptome, and affect behavior and physiology, potentially decreasing organismal fitness in contaminated ecosystems. The uniquely broad scale of this study during a critical window of development provides crucial multidimensional characterization of NP impacts on human and animal health.

AB  - Goldfish (Carassius auratus) juveniles were exposed to virgin polyvinyl chloride microplastics (PVC-MPs) in triplicate at 0, 0.1 or 0.5 mg/L for four days. Afterwards, the histopathology of the gills, liver and intestines were examined, along with various antioxidant enzymes and indicators of oxidative damage (malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)), in the brain, liver and gills. In addition, we also studied the expression of hepatic insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) and growth hormone (GH) receptor, while cortisol receptor (CR) and cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) gene expression were assayed in both the liver and gills. Histological analysis revealed PVC-MPs in the intestines at 0.1 and 0.5 mg/L, along with substantially shorter villi. The gills appeared undamaged by PVC-MPs exposure and had limited or no effect to antioxidant activity, Na+/K+-ATPase and H+-ATPase activity or plasma ion levels, but there was a prominent upsurge of the detoxification enzymes glutatione S-transferase (GST) activity and CYP1A expression. Livers showed inflammation and some occurrences of hemorrhaging and necrosis at 0.5 mg/L. While the brain showed some evidence of oxidative damage, the liver was the most susceptible to oxidative damage, based on increased MDA, H2O2 and various antioxidant enzymes. Hepatic expression of IGFBP-1 and GH receptor were significantly downregulated at 0.5 mg/L while CR was upregulated. Results indicate that exposure to environmentally relevant PVC-MP can cause oxidative damage in the brain and liver, adverse histomorphological changes to the intestine and liver and alter the gene expression in goldfish.

AB  - Microplastic contamination poses a great threat to the health of aquatic species, which may affect their reproduction and result in ecological consequences. There is a need to further elucidate the potential impact microplastics can impose on aquatic species. In this study, the effects of exposure to polystyrene microplastics on reproductive organs, and the underlying response mechanisms, were investigated using zebrafish Danio rerio. After 21 days of continuous waterborne exposure, no significant difference was observed at the lower concentration of 10 μg/L. At concentrations above 100 μg/L, significantly enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was found in both male and female liver and gonads. At the concentration of 1000 μg/L, significantly increased apoptosis levels were observed in male testes, triggering increased expression of p53-mediated apoptotic pathways; histological alteration in the form of a significant decrease in testis basement membrane thickness was also observed. This study demonstrated that exposure to microplastics can induce molecular responses and histological alterations in fish gonads, implying potential adverse impact on fish reproductive organs. This work provided new insights on the reproductive damage microplastics can cause in fish and have implications in fields of freshwater ecology and environmental toxicology.

AB  - Coral reefs are degrading globally due to increased environmental stressors including warming and elevated levels of pollutants. These stressors affect not only habitat-forming organisms, such as corals, but they may also directly affect the organisms that inhabit these ecosystems. Here, we explore how the dual threat of habitat degradation and microplastic exposure may affect the behaviour and survival of coral reef fish in the field. Fish were caught prior to settlement and pulse-fed polystyrene microplastics six times over 4 days, then placed in the field on live or dead-degraded coral patches. Exposure to microplastics or dead coral led fish to be bolder, more active and stray further from shelter compared to control fish. Effect sizes indicated that plastic exposure had a greater effect on behaviour than degraded habitat, and we found no evidence of synergistic effects. This pattern was also displayed in their survival in the field. Our results highlight that attaining low concentrations of microplastic in the environment will be a useful management strategy, since minimizing microplastic intake by fishes may work concurrently with reef restoration strategies to enhance the resilience of coral reef populations.

AB  - Polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs), originated from breakdown of large plastic wastes, have already caused much concern for their environmental risks on health. This current study was aimed to reveal the toxicological mechanism of PS NPs on developing zebrafish and macrophage cells. To fulfill this purpose, 42 nm PS NPs were exposed to the early development stage of zebrafish for 5 days, the decreased heart rate and locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae were observed. The fluorescent PS NPs were used to precisely assess the accumulation of PS NPs in zebrafish larvae, and the results indicated that PS NPs not only accumulated in digestive system, but also infiltrated into the liver. More importantly, the transcriptomic analysis revealed that a total of 356 genes were differentially expressed and the KEGG class map showed significant differences in the MAPK pathway upon PS NPs treatment. Meanwhile, the induction of oxidative stress and inflammation were also observed in zebrafish larvae. Furthermore, PS NPs also induced oxidative damage and inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 cells, which activated p38 MAPK signal pathway and finally induced cell apoptosis. Our study provides a new understanding of MAPK signaling pathway involved in toxicity mechanism.

AB  - Toxicity of polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics (MPs), either virgin or spiked with chemicals, was evaluated in two short-lived fish using a freshwater species, zebrafish, and a marine species, marine medaka. Exposures were performed through diet using environmentally relevant concentrations of MPs over 4 months. No modification of classical biomarkers, lipid peroxidation, genotoxicity or F0 behaviour was observed. A significant decrease in growth was reported after at least two months of exposure. This decrease was similar between species, independent from the type of MPs polymer and the presence or not of spiked chemicals, but was much stronger in females. The reproduction was evaluated and it revealed a significant decrease in the reproductive output for both species and in far more serious numbers in medaka. PVC appeared more reprotoxic than PE as were MPs spiked with PFOS and benzophenone-3 compared to MPs spiked with benzo[a]pyrene. Further, PVC-benzophenone-3 produced behavioural disruption in offspring larvae. These results obtained with two species representing different aquatic environments suggest that microplastics exert toxic effects, slightly different according to polymers and the presence or not of sorbed chemicals, which may lead in all cases to serious ecological disruptions.

AB  - The role of microplastics as chemical vectors delivering environmental contaminants into biota has been proposed, but their environmental relevance remains an issue of a debate. In this paper we compared the propensity and relative importance of synthetic polymer microparticles [glassy polystyrene (PS) and rubbery polyethylene (PE)] and silica glass particles (SG) to act as vectors for hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) into fish after ingestion. Particles were spiked with three HOCs [17α-ethinylestradiol, chlorpyrifos and benzo(α)pyrene], which differ in hydrophobicity and induce well-known biomarker responses. Three-spined stickleback were exposed to 8 different diets: control diets (1), diets with non-spiked particles (2–4), diets containing a mixture of particles spiked with 3 model contaminants (5–7) and, finally, diets loaded with only the chemical mixture (8), for 14 days. Chemical sorption onto the particles was quantified and chemical transfer into the fish was investigated via biomarkers (CYP1a, ERα, VTG, and AChE) in fish intestine, liver and brain and quantification of HOCs in fish muscle. Results demonstrated particle-mediated chemical transfer of moderately hydrophobic contaminants into fish. While PS and PE particles mediated higher chemical transfer and tissue accumulation of 17α-ethinylestradiol and chlorpyrifos than SG, the overall chemical transfer was found to be very low. The present work suggested that chemical sorption, desorption and subsequent transfer of chemicals in vivo depends on multiple interconnected factors, including physicochemical properties of particles and contaminants, as well as toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic interactions. The biomarker approach was, however, suboptimal for assessing chemical transfer when addressing particle-associated chemical mixtures.

AB  - Due to massive production, improper use, and disposal of plastics, microplastics have become global environmental pollutants affecting both freshwater and marine ecosystems. Several studies have documented the uptake of microplastics in wild species and the correlated biological effects, such as epithelial damage, inflammation, metabolic alterations, and neurotoxicity. However, the effects of microplastics are not fully understood yet. In this study, adult zebrafish have been exposed for twenty days to two concentrations of a mix of polystyrene and high-density polyethylene microplastics. The biological effects were investigated through the expression levels of a set of selected genes in head kidney samples and two enzymatic biomarkers, acetylcholinesterase and lactate dehydrogenase, in head and body homogenates respectively. The lowest microplastic concentration up-regulated genes involved in xenobiotics catabolic processes (cyp2p8), and adaptive immunity (tcra). Acetylcholinesterase activity was inhibited by the highest microplastics exposure, while a weaker and no significant inhibition was induced by the lowest concentration. No significant effects on lactate dehydrogenase activity were observed. The results presented in this study support the hypothesis that MPs exposure could induce the activation of an immune response and the xenobiotic metabolism, suggesting also that the cytochrome P450 enzyme cyp2p8 and acetylcholinesterase may be sensitive to MPs contamination.

AB  - There has been a rising interest within the scientific community and the public about the environmental risk related to the abundance of microplastics in aquatic environments. Up to now, however, scientific knowledge in this context has been scarce and insufficient for a reliable risk assessment. To remedy this scarcity of data, we investigated possible adverse effects of polystyrene particles (104 particles/L) and the pesticide methiocarb (1 mg/L) in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) both by themselves as well as in combination after a 96 h laboratory exposure. PS beads (density 1.05 g/mL) were cryogenically milled and fractionated resulting in irregular-shaped particles (< 50 µm). Besides body weight of the animals, biomarkers for proteotoxicity (stress protein family Hsp70), oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, lipid peroxidation), and neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase, carboxylesterases) were analyzed. As an indicator of overall health, histopathological effects were studied in liver and gills of exposed fish.

AB  - In the present study the effects of sublethal concentrations of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) on zebrafish were evaluated at multiple levels, related to fish activity and oxidative stress, metabolic changes and contraction parameters in the heart tissue. Zebrafish were fed for 21 days food enriched with PS-MPs (particle sizes 3–12 µm) and a battery of stress indices like DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, autophagy, ubiquitin levels, caspases activation, metabolite adjustments, frequency and force of ventricular contraction were measured in fish heart, parallel to fish swimming velocity. In particular, exposure to PS-MPs caused significant decrease in heart function and swimming competence, while enhanced levels of oxidative stress indices and metabolic adjustments were observed in the heart of challenged species. Among stress indices, DNA damage was more vulnerable to the effect of PS-MPs. Our results provide evidence on the multiplicity of the PS-MPs effects on cellular function, physiology and metabolic pathways and heart rate of adult fish and subsequent effects on fish activity and fish fitness thus enlightening MPs characterization as a potent environmental pollutant.

AB  - PURPOSE: Plastic particulates and chemicals are emerging environmental pollutants with significant impact on aquatic ecosystems. In this study, the effects of oral uptake of melamine, melamine formaldehyde, and polyvinyl chloride on serum biochemical profiles, antioxidant enzymes activities, lipid peroxidation levels and brain acetyl cholinesterase activities in Clarias gariepinus juveniles were investigated.
METHODS: Fish specimens were fed diets spiked with melamine, melamine formaldehyde and poly vinyl chloride at 0.3% (3.0 g Kg-1) dietary inclusion for 45 days. Toxicity effect of these plastic chemicals was estimated by assaying relevant biomarkers.
RESULTS: After 45 days exposure, Serum glucose was significantly elevated, whereas plasma protein levels were substantially reduced in the exposed fish groups. Serum transaminases were significantly elevated in the exposed groups. Brain acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzyme activities declined significantly, while malondialdehyde levels were elevated in the exposed groups.
CONCLUSION: C. gariepinus is an important bioindicator to monitor the ecotoxicological impact of plastic chemicals such as melamine, and polyvinyl chloride.

AB  - This study investigated the direct and indirect toxic effects of microplastics and nanoplastics toward zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae locomotor activity. Results showed that microplastics alone exhibited no significant effects except for the upregulated zfrho visual gene expression; whereas nanoplastics inhibited the larval locomotion by 22% during the last darkness period, and significantly reduced larvae body length by 6%, inhibited the acetylcholinesterase activity by 40%, and upregulated gfap, α1-tubulin, zfrho and zfblue gene expression significantly. When co-exposed with 2μg/L 17 α-ethynylestradiol (EE2), microplastics led to alleviation on EE2's inhibition effect on locomotion, which was probably due to the decreased freely dissolved EE2 concentration. However, though nanoplastics showed stronger adsorption ability for EE2, the hypoactivity phenomenon still existed in the nanoplastics co-exposure group. Moreover, when co-exposed with a higher concentration of EE2 (20μg/L), both plastics showed an enhanced effect on the hypoactivity. Principal component analysis was performed to reduce data dimensions and four principal components were reconstituted in terms of oxidative stress, body length, nervous and visual system related genes explaining 84% of total variance. Furthermore, oxidative damage and body length reduction were evaluated to be main reasons for the hypoactivity. Therefore, nanoplastics alone suppressed zebrafish larvae locomotor activity and both plastic particles can change the larvae swimming behavior when co-exposed with EE2. This study provides new insights into plastic particles' effects on zebrafish larvae, improving the understanding of their environmental risks to the aquatic environment.

AB  - Nano-sized (10(-9)-10(-7) m) particles offer many technical and biomedical advances over the bulk material. The use of nanoparticles in cosmetics, detergents, food and other commercial products is rapidly increasing despite little knowledge of their effect on organism metabolism. We show here that commercially manufactured polystyrene nanoparticles, transported through an aquatic food chain from algae, through zooplankton to fish, affect lipid metabolism and behaviour of the top consumer. At least three independent metabolic parameters differed between control and test fish: the weight loss, the triglycerides∶cholesterol ratio in blood serum, and the distribution of cholesterol between muscle and liver. Moreover, we demonstrate that nanoparticles bind to apolipoprotein A-I in fish serum in-vitro, thereby restraining them from properly utilising their fat reserves if absorbed through ingestion. In addition to the metabolic effects, we show that consumption of nanoparticle-containing zooplankton affects the feeding behaviour of the fish. The time it took the fish to consume 95% of the food presented to them was more than doubled for nanoparticle-exposed compared to control fish. Since many nano-sized products will, through the sewage system, end up in freshwater and marine habitats, our study provides a potential bioassay for testing new nano-sized material before manufacturing. In conclusion, our study shows that from knowledge of the molecular composition of the protein corona around nanoparticles it is possible to make a testable molecular hypothesis and bioassay of the potential biological risks of a defined nanoparticle at the organism and ecosystem level.

AB  - Plastic pollution is a critical environmental concern and comprises the majority of anthropogenic debris in the ocean, including macro, micro, and likely nanoscale (less than 100nm in at least one dimension) plastic particles. While the toxicity of macroplastics and microplastics is relatively well studied, the toxicity of nanoplastics is largely uncharacterized. Here, fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) were used to investigate the potential toxicity of nanoplastics in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio), as well as to characterize the uptake and distribution of the particles within embryos and larvae. Zebrafish embryos at 6h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to PS NPs (0.1, 1, or 10ppm) until 120 hpf. Our results demonstrate that PS NPs accumulated in the yolk sac as early as 24 hpf and migrated to the gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, liver, pancreas, heart, and brain throughout development (48-120 hpf). Accumulation of PS NPs decreased during the depuration phase (120-168 hpf) in all organs, but at a slower rate in the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. Notably, exposure to PS NPs did not induce significant mortality, deformities, or changes to mitochondrial bioenergetics, but did decrease the heart rate. Lastly, exposure to PS NPs altered larval behavior as evidenced by swimming hypoactivity in exposed larvae. Taken together, these data suggest that at least some nanoplastics can penetrate the chorion of developing zebrafish, accumulate in the tissues, and affect physiology and behavior, potentially affecting organismal fitness in contaminated aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Uptake and toxicity of microplastics on marine organisms have been reported elsewhere. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the ecological effects of microplastics on marine organisms. In this study, we investigated the effects of polystyrene microplastics (1 × 106 microspheres per L) on the behavior, energy reserve and nutritional composition of juvenile jacopever (Sebastes schlegelii). Compared to the controls, fish treated by microplastics showed lower sensitivity toward the added food in the tank, and increased foraging time, indicating that microplastics significantly weakened feeding activity of the fish. Interestingly, the microplastics treated-fish obviously reduced swimming speed and range of movement, demonstrating that polystyrene microplastics could have negative effect on hunting behavior. Furthermore, polystyrene microplastics accumulated in the gills and intestine, causing significant histopathological changes in the gallbladder and liver. Moreover, the energy reserve and nutritional quality of fish were influenced by microplastics as evidenced by lower growth, protein and lipid contents. Our results highlighted the potential negative effects of microplastics on marine ecological function and food safety.

AB  - While the presence of microplastics (MPs) in marine environments has been detected worldwide, the importance of MPs pollution in freshwater environments has also been emphasized in recent years. However, the body of knowledge regarding the biological effects of MPs on freshwater organisms is still much more limited than on marine organisms. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accumulation and tissue distribution of MPs in the freshwater fish red tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), as well as the biochemical effects of MPs on O. niloticus. During 14 days of exposure to 0.1 μm polystyrene-MPs at concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 μg L−1, the MPs concentrations in various tissues of O. niloticus generally increased over time following the order gut > gills > liver ≈ brain. Moreover, the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the fish brain was inhibited by MPs exposure, with a maximum inhibition rate of 37.7%, suggesting the potential neurotoxicity of MPs to freshwater fish. The activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes [7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and 7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin O-dibenzyloxylase (BFCOD)] in the fish liver exhibited clear temporal variabilities, with significant decreases followed by elevations compared to the control. The alterations of the EROD and BFCOD activities indicate the potential involvement of CYP enzymes for the metabolism of MPs. The activity of antioxidative enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver was significantly induced throughout the exposure period, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) content did not vary with MPs exposure, suggesting that the antioxidative enzymatic system in O. niloticus could prevent oxidative damage. These results highlight the ingestion and accumulation of MPs in different tissues of freshwater fish, which lead to perturbations in fish biological systems and should be considered in environmental risk assessment.

AB  - While microplastics are present in great abundance across all seas and oceans, little is known about their effects on marine life. In the aquatic environment, they can accumulate a variety of chemicals and can be ingested by many marine organisms including fish, with chronic physical and chemical effects. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the toxic effects of pollutants sorbed at the surface of environmental microplastics (MPs), collected on various beaches from three islands of the Pacific Ocean. Developmental toxicity of virgin MPs or artificially coated with B[a]P and environmental MPs from Easter Island, Guam and Hawaii was evaluated on embryos and prolarvae of Japanese medaka. Mortality, hatching success, biometry, malformations, EROD activity and DNA damage were analyzed after exposure to DMSO extracts. No toxicity was observed for extracts of virgin MPs whatever the endpoint considered. Extracts of virgin MPs coated with 250 µg.g−1 of B(a)P induced lethal effects with high embryo mortality (+81%) and low hatching rate (−28%) and sublethal effects including biometry and swimming behavior changes, increase of EROD activity (+94%) and DNA damage (+60%). Environmental MPs collected on the three selected islands exhibited different polymer, pollutant and toxicity patterns. The highest toxicity was detected for MPs extract from Hawaï with head/body length and swimming speed decreases and induction of EROD activity and DNA stand breaks. This study reports the possible sublethal toxicity of organic pollutants sorbed on MPs to fish early life stages.

AB  - Nano-sized plastic particles formed from both daily use plastics and its debris have become a potential health and environmental problem due to features such as transportation through food webs and maternal transfer. Although many studies on the toxicity of plastics exist more detailed and molecular studies are needed to evaluate and review the effects of plastics especially in nano-size range. For this purpose, we have microinjected polystyrene nanoplastics (PNP) (20 nm) to the zebrafish embryo, which is one of the best model organisms for developmental toxicity studies, to simulate intake with food or maternal. Survival, hatching and malformations evaluated during the experimental period (120 h). Moreover, we have aimed to put forth the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis signalling accumulation in the body in addition to bioaccumulation of PNP and immunochemical toxicity (8-OHdG) on the brain of zebrafish larvae at the 120th hour. According to results, it has been demonstrated that 20 nm diameter PNP can reach the brain and bioaccumulate there, moreover lead to oxidative DNA damage in the brain regions where it bioaccumulates. Here we have also imaged the PNP from a vertebrate brain via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for the first time. As a result of these, it has been detected increasing mortality and prevailing abnormalities in addition to excessive ROS and apoptosis in especially the brain. As a conclusion, obtained data have suggested that precautions, on the use and contamination of the plastic product, to be taken during both pregnancy and baby care/feeding are important for the health of the baby in future.

AB  - There is growing concern that microplastics (MPs), which act as carriers of other organic contaminants, are mistakenly ingested by aquatic organisms, consequently causing unpredictable adverse effects. In this study, zebrafish larvae (6 d post fertilization) were exposed to either 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B), polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) or their combination for 7 d to evaluate the effects of the presence of PS-MPs on the bioaccumulation and immunomodulation of F-53B. PS-MPs greatly promoted the sorption of F-53B, which reduced the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of F-53B in zebrafish larvae. F-53B, PS-MPs, or their mixture significantly reduced the body weight of zebrafish larvae. Combined exposure of PS-MPs and F-53B resulted in a significant reduction in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lysozyme activity, indicating the occurrence of oxidative stress and inflammatory response in zebrafish larvae. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) was not affected by F-53B or PS-MPs, but significantly increased in their combined exposure. Furthermore, co-exposure of F-53B and PS-MPs significantly upregulated the transcripts of pro-inflammatory cxcl-clc and il-1β genes and increased the levels of iNOS protein in zebrafish larvae. In addition, enhanced protein expression of NF-κB paralleled the upregulation in the expression of most immune-related genes, suggesting NF-κB pathway was mechanistically involved in these responses. Collectively, the presence of MPs decreased F-53B bioaccumulation, but induced inflammatory stress in larval zebrafish. These findings highlight the health risks of co-contamination of MPs and F-53B in aquatic environments.

AB  - Data about the toxicological interactions of MPs and heavy metals in biota is limited, particularly in fish early life stages. This study aimed to evaluate the toxicological effects of MPs and copper (Cu), alone or combined, in zebrafish early life stages. Embryos were exposed from 2 until 96-h post-fertilization (hpf) to MPs (2 mg/L), three sub-lethal concentrations of Cu (15, 60 and 125 μg/L) and binary mixtures containing Cu and MPs (Cu15+MPs, Cu60+MPs, Cu125+MPs). Lethal and sub-lethal parameters, histopathological changes, biochemical biomarkers, gene expression and behavior were assessed. Our findings showed that Cu and Cu + MPs decreased embryos survival and hatching rate. Increased ROS levels were observed in larvae exposed to the two lowest Cu and Cu + MPs groups, suggesting an induction of oxidative stress. An increased CAT and GPx activities were observed in Cu and Cu + MPs, implying a response of the antioxidant defense system to overcome the metal and MPs stress. The sod1 expression was downregulated in all Cu groups and in the two highest Cu + MPs exposed groups. AChE was significantly inhibited in Cu and Cu + MPs groups, indicating neurotoxicity. A disruption of avoidance and social behaviors were also noticed in the Cu125 and Cu125+MPs exposed larvae. Evidences of Cu-toxicity modulation by MPs were observed in some endpoints. Overall, the findings of this study highlight that Cu alone or co-exposed with MPs lead to oxidative stress, neurotoxicity and ultimately behavioral alterations in early life stages of zebrafish, while MPs alone do not produce significant effects on zebrafish larvae.

AB  - Microplastic pollution has drawn the attention of both scientists and the public regarding their potential ecotoxicological risks. In the present study, we carried out aqueous exposure experiments to adult zebrafish with polystyrene microplastics (5 μm) at a wide range of concentrations (0.001-20 mg/L, equals to 14.5∼2.9 × 105 particles/mL). Our results showed the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was the dominant microplastic accumulation site in zebrafish, followed by the gill, whereas no microplastics were detected in the brain or muscle. Microplastic accumulation in GIT did not cause obvious damages to intestinal villi in general. However, the thickness of muscularis layer in the foregut reduced by 32% after 1 mg/L (1.45 × 104 particles/mL) microplastic exposure. As there were no signs of oxidative stress or other histological changes found in the fish, we further investigated the energy-supplying influential factors. We found that the zebrafish became hyperactive after microplastic exposure, whose swimming distance had increased to 1.3-2.4 folds than that of control, and also stayed at manic and active states much longer. The fish behavioural alteration is probably attributed to the particulate matter stimulation and the up-regulation of estrogen contents. Results also showed that the excessive movements of zebrafish also led to decreased glucose and acetaldehyde metabolite contents and increased amino acid amounts, which further proved the shortage of energy-supplying substances. Therefore, the present study suggests that micro-sized microplastics can induce obvious behavioural abnormality at concentrations that some other toxicological endpoints may not warn effects.

AB  - The literature has largely shown the toxicity of petroleum-based PLA biomicroplastics (PLABioMPs) and encouraged the production of alternative materials to replace their use, such as biopolymers. However, knowledge concerning the effects of biopolymers on aquatic organisms remains under development. The hypothesis that the acute exposure (five days) to polylactic acid (PLA) biopolymers may lead to behavioral and biochemical changes and to their accumulation in Danio rerio larvae was tested. Based on the results, PLA biomicroplastics (PLA BioMPs) at concentration of 3 and 9 mg/L decreased swimming distance and speed of larvae in the open field test. This outcome suggests effects on animals’ locomotor and exploration activities. Larvae’s longer immobility time and greater permanence in the peripheral zone of the apparatus is indicative of anxiety-like behavior caused by the exposure to PLA BioMPs. Zebrafish larvae accumulated PLA BioMPs and their acetylcholinesterase activity was inhibited by their presence, which reinforces the accumulative potential of biopolymers and their direct or indirect role as anxiogenic agents, even at sublethal concentrations. The decreased activity of acetylcholinesterase reinforces the neurotoxic action in groups exposed to PLA BioMPs. The current study has confirmed the initial hypothesis and is an insight about the toxicity of these biopolymers in D. rerio larvae, since it deepens the discussion about the environmental risk of these substances in freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Recently, the ubiquitous presence of microplastics (MPs) has drawn worldwide concern over its potential threat to aquatic organisms. However, the effects of MPs on the olfactory ability of fish and the subsequent odorant evoked behaviors remain elusive. In the present study, we analyzed the potential olfactory toxicity of polystyrene (PS) MPs by assessing olfactory-driven behaviors of goldfish in response to odorants. Our results showed that the olfactory-driven behavioral responses of goldfish to L-cysteine and taurocholic acid were significantly hampered by a 28-day MP exposure. Further analysis demonstrated that exposure to MPs may suppress the expression of genes encoding olfactory G protein-coupled receptors, inhibit the enzyme activities of cation transport ATPases crucial for action potential generation, alter the in vivo contents of neurotransmitters as well as metabolites involved in the transduction of electrical signals, and cause olfactory bulb injury and neurotoxicity closely related to the processing of electrical signals. In conclusion, the results obtained in the present study suggest that MPs at environmentally relevant concentrations could impair the olfactory-mediated behavioral responses of goldfish, probably through hampering odorant identification, action potential generation, olfactory neural signal transduction, and olfactory information processing.

AB  - Whether microplastics themselves or their interactions with chemicals influence the health and development of aquatic organisms has become a matter of scientific discussion. In aquatic environments, several groups of chemicals are abundant in parallel to microplastics. The tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline is frequently prescribed, and residues of it are regularly found in surface waters. In the present study, the influence of irregularly shaped polystyrene microplastics (<50 µm), amitriptyline, and their mixture on early life-stages of brown trout were investigated. In a first experiment, the impacts of 100, 104, and 105 particles/L were studied from the fertilization of eggs until one month after yolk-sac consumption. In a second experiment, eggs were exposed in eyed ova stages to 105, 106 particles/L, to amitriptyline (pulse-spiked, average 48 ± 33 µg/L) or to two mixtures for two months. Microplastics alone did neither influence the development of fish nor the oxidative stress level or the acetylcholinesterase activity. Solely, a slight effect on the resting behavior of fry exposed to 106 particles/L was observed. Amitriptyline exposure exerted a significant effect on development, caused elevated acetylcholinesterase activity and inhibition of two carboxylesterases. Most obvious was the severely altered swimming and resting behavior. However, effects of amitriptyline were not modulated by microplastics.

AB  - The presence of small-sized (<300 µm) microplastics (MPs) in aquaculture facilities may threaten finfish hatchery, as their (in)voluntary ingestion by fish larvae may compromise nutritional requirements during early ontogeny, and consequently larval health and performance. Thus, we addressed the short-term effects (7 h) of polyethylene microplastics (0.1, 1.0, 10 mg/L, PE-MPs) in meagre larvae Argyrosomus regius (15 dph) in the presence/absence of food. Larval feeding behavior, oxidative stress status, neurotoxicity, and metabolic requirements were evaluated. Results showed that meagre larvae ingested PE-MPs regardless of their concentration, decreasing in the presence of food (Artemia metanauplii). The presence of PE-MPs compromised larval feeding activity at the highest concentration. Under starvation, exposed larvae activated the antioxidant defenses by increasing the total glutathione levels and inhibiting catalase activity, which seemed efficient to prevent oxidative damage. Such larvae also presented increased energy consumption potentially related to oxidative damage prevention and decreased neurotransmission. Biochemical responses of fed larvae showed a similar trend, except for LPO, which remained unaffected, except at 0.1 mg/PE-MPs/L. Our results suggest that small-sized MPs in finfish hatcheries may compromise larvae nutritional requirements, but at considerably higher levels than those reported in marine environments. Nevertheless, cumulative adverse effects due to lower MPs concentrations may occur.

AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate the toxicity of cefalexin to Pomatoschistus microps juveniles in relation to the presence of microplastics in the water and temperature rise. After acclimatization, groups of wild juveniles were exposed for 96h to artificial salt water (control), microplastics alone (0.184mg/l), cefalexin alone (1.3-10mg/l) and in mixture with microplastics (cefalexin: 1.3-10mg/l; microplastics: 0.184mg/l) at 20 and 25°C. Effect criteria were mortality, post-exposure predatory performance (PEPP), acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and lipid peroxidation levels (LPO). At 20°C, concentrations of cefalexin alone≥5mg/l significantly reduced PEPP (up to 56%; 96h-EC50=8.4mg/l), indicating toxicity of the antibiotic to juveniles after short-term exposure to water concentrations in the low ppm range. At 20°C, fish exposed to microplastics alone did not have significant differences in any of the parameters tested relative to the control group but tended to have an inhibition of the PEPP (23%) and AChE (21%); at 25°C, microplastics alone caused mortality (33%) and PEPP inhibition (28%). Thus, microplastics are toxic to P. microps juveniles. At 20°C, under simultaneous exposure to cefalexin and microplastics, the PEPP was significantly reduced (at cefalexin concentrations≥1.25mg/l). Moreover, at 25°C, the toxicity curves of cefalexin (PEPP based), alone and in mixture with microplastics, were significantly different (p<0.05; 96h-EC50 of 3.8 and 5.2mg/l, respectively), and the integrated data analysis indicated significant interactions between the two substances for all biomarkers. Thus, the presence of microplastics in the water influenced the toxicity of cefalexin. The rise of water temperature (from 20°C to 25°C), increased the microplastics-induced mortality (from 8 to 33%), and the inhibitory effects of cefalexin on the PEPP (up to 70%). Significant differences (p<0.05) between the toxicity curves of cefalexin alone at distinct temperatures were found, with a lower 96h-EC50 at 25°C (3.8mg/l) than at 20°C (8.4mg/l). Moreover, at 25°C, increases of AChE activity (14%) and LPO (72%) in fish exposed to the mixture treatment containing the highest cefalexin concentration were found, and the integrated analysis of data indicated significant interactions between cefalexin and temperature for PEPP, and among all stressors for LPO. Thus, the temperature rise increased the toxicity of microplastics and of cefalexin, alone and in mixture with microplastics, to P. microps juveniles. These findings raise concern on the long-term exposure of wild populations to complex mixtures of pollutants, likely decreasing their fitness, and highlight the need of more research on the combined effects of widely used pharmaceuticals, microplastics and temperature increase on wild species to improve environmental and human risk assessments of chemicals and their safe use under a global warming scenario.

AB  - The increasing global contamination of plastics in marine environments is raising public concerns about the potential hazards of microplastics to environmental and human health. Microplastics formed by the breakdown of larger plastics are typically irregular in shape. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of spherical or irregular shapes of microplastics on changes in organ distribution, swimming behaviors, gene expression, and enzyme activities in sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus). Both types of microplastics accumulated in the digestive system, causing intestinal distention. However, when compared to spherical microplastics, irregular microplastics decreased swimming behavior (i.e., total distance travelled and maximum velocity) of sheepshead minnow. Both microplastics generated cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), while ROS-related molecular changes (i.e., transcriptional and enzymatic characteristics) differed. This study provides toxicological insights into the impacts of environmentally relevant (fragmented) microplastics on fish and improves our understanding of the environmental effects of microplastics in the ecosystem.

AB  - This study investigated the trophic transfer, individual impact, and embryonic uptake of fluorescent nano-sized polystyrene plastics (nanoplastics) through direct exposure in a freshwater ecosystem, with a food chain containing four species. The alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, water flea Daphnia magna, secondary-consumer fish Oryzias sinensis, and end-consumer fish Zacco temminckii were used as test species. In the trophic transfer test, algae were exposed to 50 mg/L nanoplastics, defined as plastic particles <100 nm in diameter; higher trophic level organisms were exposed through their diet. In the direct exposure test, each species was directly exposed to nanoplastics. Microscopic analysis confirmed that the nanoplastics adhered to the surface of the primary producer and were present in the digestive organs of the higher trophic level species. Nanoplastics also negatively affected fish activity, as measured by distance traveled and area covered, and induced histopathological changes in the livers of fish that were directly exposed. Additionally, nanoplastics penetrated the embryo walls and were present in the yolk sac of hatched juveniles. These observations clearly show that nanoplastics are easily transferred through food chain, albeit because of high experimental dosages. Nevertheless, the results strongly point to the potential health risks of nanoplastic exposure.

AB  - One of the current main challenges faced by the scientific community is concerning the fate and toxicity of plastics, due to both the well-known threats made by larger plastic items spreading in ecosystems and their fragmentation into micro- and nanoparticles. Since the chemical and physical characteristics of these smaller plastic fragments are markedly different with respect to their bulk product, the potential toxicological effects in the environment need to be deeply investigated. To partially fill this gap of knowledge, the aim of this study was to evaluate the polystyrene nanobead intake in the tissues of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and their related toxicity. Embryos at 72 h post fertilization (hpf) were exposed for 48 h to 0.5 μm fluorescent polystyrene nanobeads at a concentration of 1 mg L-1. Confocal microscopy was employed to investigate nanoplastic ingestion and tissue infiltration, while potential sub-lethal effects were evaluated by measuring several endpoints, which covered the adverse effects at the molecular (protein carbonylation), cellular (P-glycoprotein, activity of several antioxidant/detoxifying enzymes) and organism levels by evaluating of possible changes in the embryos' swimming behaviour. Imaging observations clearly highlighted the nanoplastics' uptake, showing nanobeads not only in the digestive tract, but also migrating to other tissues through the gut epithelium. Biomarker analyses revealed a significant decrease in cyclooxygenase activity and an induction of superoxide dismutase. The behavioural test highlighted a significant (p < 0.05) variation in the turn angle between the control and exposed embryos. This study points out the capability of nanoplastics to infiltrate zebrafish embryo tissues, even after a short exposure, thus suggesting the need for deeper investigations following longer exposure times, and highlighting the potential of nanoplastics to cause toxicological effects on freshwater organisms, at the organism level.

AB  - To identify the physical effects, behavioral changes, and gene expression profiles of the phase 1 detoxification-related gene (cyp 1a) and oogenesis-related gene (vtg 1) induced by microplastics, high-density polyethylene microplastics of various sizes were used because of their dominance in coastal areas and effluent samples in Hong Kong. Adult zebrafish were used as the model organism to identify the upper and lower boundaries of microplastics ingestion and were exposed to individual polyethylene microplastics in five size ranges (10-22 μm, 45-53 μm, 90-106 μm, 212-250 μm, and 500-600 μm) at a concentration of 2 mg/L for 96 h. To study behavioral changes and targeted gene expression profiles via real-time PCR (qPCR), a mixture of microplastics in three size ranges at effluent-related (11 particles/L), moderate (110 particles/L), and high concentrations (1,100 particles/L) were applied for 96 h. The zebrafish behavior was recorded by a video camera and by two observers (interrater reliability, >85%). The results implied that the upper and lower size boundaries for microplastic ingestion were 558.4 ± 26.2 μm (yellow) and 19.7 ± 3.1 μm (red), respectively. In addition, 61 ± 10% of fish in medium concentration treatments and 61 ± 10% of fish in high concentration treatments were found with the microplastic ingestion and remaining in their intestine. In addition, 28 ± 10% of fish in high concentration treatments were found with microplastic retaining in their gills (No. of fishes = 18 in each treatment). The presence of microplastics, which occupied 89 ± 6% of intestine area, reduced the voids inside the intestine for feed. The expression of cyp1a in the intestine (medium concentration) and vtg1 in the liver (medium and high concentration) showed significant up-regulation, and abnormal behavior (i.e., seizures and tail bent downward) was observed (medium and high concentration). In summary, the effects on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway, disruption of the oogenesis process, and neurotoxicity could be caused by acute exposure of adult zebrafish to microplastics.

AB  - Microplastics have become pervasive environmental pollutants in both freshwater and marine ecosystems. The presence of microplastics have been recorded in the tissues of many wild fish species, and laboratory studies have demonstrated that microplastics can exert adverse health effects. To further investigate the biological mechanisms underlying microplastics toxicity we applied an integrated approach, analyzing the effects of microplastics at transcriptomic, histological and behavioral level. Adult zebrafish have been exposed to two concentrations of high-density polyethylene and polystyrene microplastics for twenty days. Transcriptomic results indicate alterations in the expression of immune system genes and the down-regulation of genes correlated with epithelium integrity and lipid metabolism. The transcriptomic findings are supported by tissue alterations and higher occurrence of neutrophils observed in gills and intestinal epithelium. Even the daily rhythm of activity of zebrafish appears to be affected, although the regular pattern of activity is recovered over time. Considering the transcriptomic and histological findings reported, we hypothesize that the effects on mucosal epithelium integrity and immune response could potentially reduce the organism defense against pathogens, and lead to a different utilization of energy stores.

AB  - Plastic pollution is one of the most serious environmental issues worldwide. The negative influence of plastics on aquatic organisms has increasingly concerned, especially the influence of microplastic (MPs). In the present study, the toxicology of nano-sized MPs (nMPs) and micron-sized MPs (mMPs) were comparatively studied. Goldfish larvae were exposed to 10, 100 and 1000 μg/L nMPs and mMPs for 1, 3 and 7 days. The enrichment of MPs, body length, heart rate, motor ability, microscopic and ultrastructure of intestine, liver, gill and muscle tissue, as well as the oxidative stress were analyzed. Results showed that both 70 nm and 50 μm MPs were accumulated in the digestive tract of larvae. MPs at high concentrations could induce oxidative stress, destroy intestine, liver and gill tissues, increase heart rate, and inhibit growth and swimming speed of the larvae. The most important finding was that nMPs could enter into the muscle tissue through the epidermis of the larvae. It could cause damage to muscle tissue, destroy nerve fibers, inhibit acetylcholinase (AchE) activity, and show great adverse effects on larval movement than mMPs. In conclusion, both nMPs and mMPs at higher concentrations can cause damage to fish larvae and nMPs are potentially more hazardous.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are present throughout aquatic ecosystems, and can be ingested by a wide variety of organisms. At present, the physical and chemical effects of environmental MPs on aquatic organisms are poorly documented. This study aims to examine the physiological and behavioral effects caused by fish consuming environmental microplastics at different life stages. MP samples were collected from beaches on three islands (Easter Island, Guam and Hawaii) located near the North and South gyres of the Pacific Ocean. Larvae and juveniles of Japanese Medaka were fed for 30days with three doses of MPs (0.01, 0.1 and 1% w/w in fish food) approximate to the concentrations measured in moderately and heavily contaminated ocean areas. Ingestion of MPs by medaka larvae caused (variously) death, decreased head/body ratios, increased EROD activity and DNA breaks and, alterations to swimming behavior. A diet of 0.1% MPs was the most toxic. Two-month-old juveniles fed with 0.01% MPs did not exhibit any symptoms except an increase in DNA breaks. Our results demonstrate ingestion and mainly sublethal effects of environmental MPs in early life stages of fish at realistic MP concentrations. The toxicity of microplastics varies from one sample to another, depending on polymer composition, weathering and pollutant content. This study examines the ecological consequences microplastic build-up in aquatic ecosystems, more particularly in coastal marine areas, which serve as breeding and growing grounds for a number of aquatic species.

AB  - Plastic pollution is a growing global emergency and it could serve as a geological indicator of the Anthropocene era. Microplastics are potentially more hazardous than macroplastics, as the former can permeate biological membranes. The toxicity of microplastic exposure on humans and aquatic organisms has been documented, but the toxicity and behavioral changes of nanoplastics (NPs) in mammals are scarce. In spite of their small size, nanoplastics have an enormous surface area, which bears the potential to bind even bigger amounts of toxic compounds in comparison to microplastics. Here, we used polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) (diameter size at ~70 nm) to investigate the neurobehavioral alterations, tissue distribution, accumulation, and specific health risk of nanoplastics in adult zebrafish. The results demonstrated that PS-NPs accumulated in gonads, intestine, liver, and brain with a tissue distribution pattern that was greatly dependent on the size and shape of the NPs particle. Importantly, an analysis of multiple behavior endpoints and different biochemical biomarkers evidenced that PS-NPs exposure induced disturbance of lipid and energy metabolism as well as oxidative stress and tissue accumulation. Pronounced behavior alterations in their locomotion activity, aggressiveness, shoal formation, and predator avoidance behavior were exhibited by the high concentration of the PS-NPs group, along with the dysregulated circadian rhythm locomotion activity after its chronic exposure. Moreover, several important neurotransmitter biomarkers for neurotoxicity investigation were significantly altered after one week of PS-NPs exposure and these significant changes may indicate the potential toxicity from PS-NPs exposure. In addition, after ~1-month incubation, the fluorescence spectroscopy results revealed the accumulation and distribution of PS-NPs across zebrafish tissues, especially in gonads, which would possibly further affect fish reproductive function. Overall, our results provided new evidence for the adverse consequences of PS-NPs-induced behavioral dysregulation and changes at the molecular level that eventually reduce the survival fitness of zebrafish in the ecosystem.

AB  - Plastics have been recognized as a serious threat to the environment. Besides their own toxicity, microplastics can interact with other environmental pollutants, acting as carriers and potentially modulating their toxicity. In this study, the toxicity of polystyrene (PS) microplastic fragments (plain PS; carboxylated PS, PS-COOH and aminated PS, PS-NH2) and triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) (an emerging organophosphate flame retardant) at the environmentally relevant concentrations to the marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) larvae was investigated. Larvae were exposed to 20 μg/L of microplastic fragments or 20 and 100 μg/L of TPhP or a combination of both for 7 days. The results showed that the three microplastics did not affect the larval locomotor activity. For TPhP, the larval moving duration and distance moved were significantly decreased by the TPhP exposure, with a maximum decrease of 43.5% and 59.4% respectively. Exposure to 100 μg/L TPhP respectively down-regulated the expression levels of sine oculis homeobox homologue 3 (six3) and short wavelength-sensitive type 2 (sws2) by 19.1% and 41.7%, suggesting that TPhP might disturb eye development and photoreception and consequently the low locomotor activity in the larvae. Interestingly, during the binary mixture exposure, the presence of PS, PS-COOH or PS-NH2 reversed the low locomotor activity induced by 100 μg/L TPhP to the normal level. Relative to the larvae from the 100 μg/L TPhP group, the movement duration and distance moved were increased by approximately 60% and 100%, respectively, in the larvae from the TPhP + PS, TPhP + PS-COOH and TPhP + PS-NH2 groups. However, the gene expression profiles were distinct among the fish from the TPhP + PS, TPhP + PS-COOH and TPhP + PS-NH2 groups, implying different mechanisms underlying the reversal of the locomotor activity. The findings in this study challenge the general view that microplastics aggravate the toxicity of the adsorbed pollutants, and help better understand the environmental risk of microplastic pollution.

AB  - In aquatic organisms, trophic transfer is a relevant exposure route for microplastics (MPs). Despite their relevance, effect studies on fish exposed via trophic chains are currently very scarce. MPs are known to contain many chemicals that could be transferred to organisms and induce deleterious effects. However, there is currently no consensus on whether MPs represent a significant exposure pathway to chemicals in contaminated habitats. Here, we exposed three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to polyethylene MPs via prey ingestion, in a one-month experiment. MPs were either pristine or spiked with chlorpyrifos (CPF), and a CPF control was included to§compare vector effects of MPs and natural prey. Following exposure, we assessed AChE activity and fish behavior (feeding, locomotion, environment exploration and reaction to the introduction of a novel object). No effect was observed in fish exposed to pristine MPs. CPF accumulation was observed in fish exposed to CPF-spiked MPs (MP-CPF), confirming the vector potential of MPs. However, CPF accumulation was more important in fish exposed to CPF via prey. In fish exposed to MP-CPF, we observed significant AChE inhibition and hyperactivity, which could result in increased vulnerability to predation. CPF organ distribution differed between groups, suggesting that chemical exposure via MPs could alter organ distribution of chemicals. This can result in a change in the organs most at risk, likely increasing intestine exposure.

T2  - Frontiers in Environmental Science
AB  - Plastics are world-wide pollutants that pose a potential threat to wildlife and human health. Small plastic particles, such as microplastics and nanoplastics, are easily ingested, and can act as a Trojan Horse by carrying microorganisms and pollutants. This study investigated the potential role of the Trojan Horse effect in the toxicity of nanoplastics to the vertebrate model organism, zebrafish (Danio rerio). First, we investigated if this effect could affect the toxicity of nanoplastics. Second, we analyzed if it could contribute to the biodistribution of the associated contaminants. And third, we focused on its effect on the mitochondrial toxicity of nanoplastics. We incubated 44 nm polystyrene nanoparticles with a real-world mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for 7 days and removed the free PAHs by ultrafiltration. We dosed embryos with 1 ppm of nanoplastics (NanoPS) or PAH-sorbed nanoplastics (PAH-NanoPS). Neither type of plastic particle caused changes in embryonic and larval development. Fluorescence microscopy and increased EROD activity suggested the uptake of PAHs in larvae exposed to PAH-NanoPS. This coincided with higher concentrations in the yolk sac and the brain. However, PAH-only exposure leads to their accumulation in the yolk sac but not in the brain, suggesting that that the spatial distribution of bioaccumulated PAHs can differ depending on their source of exposure. Both nanoplastic particles affected mitochondrial energy metabolism but caused different adverse effects. While NanoPS decreased NADH production, PAH-NanoPS decreased mitochondrial coupling efficiency and spare respiratory capacity. In summary, the addition of PAHs to the surface of nanoplastics did not translate into increased developmental toxicity. Low levels of PAHs were accumulated in the organisms, and the transfer of PAHs seems to happen in tissues and possibly organelles where nanoplastics accumulate. Disruption of the energy metabolism in the mitochondria may be a key factor in the toxicity of nanoplastics, and the Trojan Horse effect may amplify this effect.

AB  - The use of nanoparticles in consumer products, for example, cosmetics, sunscreens, and electrical devices, has increased tremendously over the past decade despite insufficient knowledge about their effects on human health and ecosystem function. Moreover, the amount of plastic waste products that enter natural ecosystems, such as oceans and lakes, is increasing, and degradation of the disposed plastics produces smaller particles toward the nano scale. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to gain knowledge about how plastic nanoparticles enter and affect living organisms. Here we have administered 24 and 27 nm polystyrene nanoparticles to fish through an aquatic food chain, from algae through Daphnia, and studied the effects on behavior and metabolism. We found severe effects on feeding and shoaling behavior as well as metabolism of the fish; hence, we conclude that polystyrene nanoparticles have severe effects on both behavior and metabolism in fish and that commonly used nanosized particles may have considerable effects on natural systems and ecosystem services derived from them.

AB  - Toxicological interactions between microplastics (MP) and other environmental contaminants are of grave concern. Here, the potential influence of MP in the short-term toxicity of chromium to early juveniles of Pomatoschistus microps was investigated. Three null hypotheses were tested: (1) exposure to Cr(VI) concentrations in the low ppm range does not induce toxic effects on juveniles; (2) the presence of microplastics in the water does not influence the acute toxicity of Cr(VI) to juveniles; (3) the environmental conditions of the natural habitat where fish developed do not influence their sensitivity to Cr(VI)-induced acute stress. Fish were collected in the estuaries of Minho (M-est) and Lima (L-est) Rivers (NW Iberian Peninsula) that have several abiotic differences, including in the water and sediment concentrations of various environmental contaminants. After acclimatization to laboratory conditions, two 96h acute bioassays were carried out with juveniles from both estuaries to: (i) investigate the effects of Cr(VI) alone; (ii) investigate the effects of Cr(VI) in the presence of MP (polyethylene spheres 1–5μm ∅). Cr(VI) alone induced mortality (96h-LC50s: 14.4–30.5mg/l) and significantly decreased fish predatory performance (≤74%). Thus, in the range of concentrations tested (5.6–28.4mg/l) Cr(VI) was found to be toxic to P. microps early juveniles, therefore, we rejected hypothesis 1. Under simultaneous exposure to Cr(VI) and MP, a significant decrease of the predatory performance (≤67%) and a significant inhibition of AChE activity (≤31%) were found. AChE inhibition was not observed in the test with Cr(VI) alone and MP alone caused an AChE inhibition ≤21%. Mixture treatments containing Cr(VI) concentration ≥3.9mg/l significantly increased LPO levels in L-est fish, an effect that was not observed under Cr(VI) or MP single exposures. Thus, toxicological interactions between Cr(VI) and MP occurred, therefore, we rejected hypothesis 2. In the presence of MP, the negative effect caused by high concentrations of Cr(VI) on the predatory performance was significantly reduced in L-est fish but not in M-est fish, and Cr(VI) concentrations higher than 3.9mg/l caused oxidative damage in L-est fish but not in M-est fish. The acclimatization and test conditions were similar for fish from the two estuaries and these ecosystems have environmental differences. Thus, long-term exposure to distinct environmental conditions in the natural habitat during previous developmental phases influenced the sensitivity and responses of juveniles to Cr(VI), therefore, we rejected hypothesis 3. Overall, the results of this study indicate toxicological interactions between MP and Cr(VI) highlighting the importance of further investigating the combined effects of MP and other common contaminants.

AB  - Knowledge on multi-stressors effects required for environmental and human risk assessments is still limited. This study investigated the combined effects of gold nanoparticles (Au-NP), microplastics (MP) and temperature increase on Pomatoschistus microps, an important prey for several higher level predators, including some species edible to humans. Four null hypotheses were tested: H01: P. microps juveniles do not take up Au-NP through the water; H02: Au-NP (ppb range) are not toxic to juveniles; H03: the presence of MP do not influence the effects of Au-NP on juveniles; H04: temperature increase (20-25°C) does not change the effects of the tested chemicals on juveniles. Wild juveniles were acclimated to laboratory conditions. Then, they were exposed to Au-NP (≈5nm diameter) and MP (polyethylene spheres, 1-5μm diameter), alone and in mixture, at 20°C and 25°C, in semi-static conditions. After 96h of exposure to Au-NP, fish had gold in their body (0.129-0.546μg/g w.w.) leading to H01 refusal. Exposure to Au-NP alone caused a predatory performance decrease (≈-39%, p<0.05) leading to H02 refusal. MP did not change the Au-NP toxicity leading to H03 acceptance. Temperature rise significantly increased the concentration of gold in fish exposed to Au-NP (≈2.3 fold), and interacted with chemical effects (e.g. glutathione S-transferases activity) leading to H04 refusal. Thus, the results of this study highlight the importance of further investigating the effects of multi-stressors on marine fish, particularly the effects of temperature on the uptake, biotransformation, elimination and effects of nanoparticles and microplastics, either alone or in mixture. This knowledge is most important to improve the basis for environmental and human risk assessments of these environmental contaminants of high concern.

AB  - The tremendous increases in production of plastic materials has led to an accumulation of plastic pollution worldwide. Many studies have addressed the physical effects of large-sized plastics on organisms, whereas few have focused on plastic nanoparticles, despite their distinct chemical, physical and mechanical properties. Hence our understanding of their effects on ecosystem function, behaviour and metabolism of organisms remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that plastic nanoparticles reduce survival of aquatic zooplankton and penetrate the blood-to-brain barrier in fish and cause behavioural disorders. Hence, for the first time, we uncover direct interactions between plastic nanoparticles and brain tissue, which is the likely mechanism behind the observed behavioural disorders in the top consumer. In a broader perspective, our findings demonstrate that plastic nanoparticles are transferred up through a food chain, enter the brain of the top consumer and affect its behaviour, thereby severely disrupting the function of natural ecosystems.

AB  - After nano- (0.5 μm) or micro- (15 μm) polystyrene (PS) microplastics exposure, the behavior, metabolism and energy reserve in marine demersal fish (Sebastes schlegelii) were evaluated. The behavior of fish was accurately recorded by video behavior tracking technology. Results showed that changes in behavior (e.g. cluster, the reduction of swimming speed and range of movement) were significantly greater in 15-μm PS-exposed fish, which may affect hunting behavior and exploration competence. Oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion of fish was significantly greater in 15-μm PS treatment than in 0.5-μm PS treatment, suggesting respiration and metabolism stress. Moreover, the abnormal behavior, respiration and ammonia excretion of PS-exposed fish had recovered modestly. In addition, abnormal symptoms of bile, liver and lumen of intestine were detected in 15-μm PS exposure. Importantly, the growth and gross energy of fish were reduced in 15-μm PS exposure than 0.5-μm PS exposure. Both 0.5-μm and 15-μm PS exposures led to significantly lower protein and lipid contents, suggesting energy reserve and nutrition quality reduction of fish. Overall, microplastics had the negative impact at greater levels than nanoplastics. Altered behavior, energy reserve and nutritional quality of fish indicated the potential risk on biological functions, the development of fishery and food safety.

AB  - Knowledge on the impacts of microplastics (MPs) pollution on freshwater environments and biota remains limited. Meanwhile, freshwater ecosystems have been threatened by elevated temperatures caused by climate change. To date, no information exists on how MPs-especially under elevated temperature conditions-affect predatory performance, digestive processes and metabolic pathways in freshwater organisms. Here, we examined MPs, elevated temperature and their combined effects on juveniles (0+ group) of an Amazonian cichlid, the discus fish (Symphysodon aequifasciatus). For 30 days, fish were exposed to ambient or elevated temperatures (i.e., 28 or 31 °C) in the absence or presence of MPs (i.e., 0 or 200 μg/L). The following metrics were quantified: MPs accumulation; predatory performance; and biomarkers involved in neurotransmission, digestion and energy production. The results showed that survival rate and body length were not affected by MPs, elevated temperatures or their combination. Elevated temperatures resulted in an increase in MP concentrations in fish bodies. Exposure to MPs decreased the post-exposure predatory performance (PEPP) at ambient temperatures but not at elevated temperatures. Elevated temperatures, however, had no effect on the PEPP but antagonistically interacted with MPs, leading to similar predatory performances under present and future conditions. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was only affected by MPs and decreased in the presence of MPs, indicating adverse effects in nervous and neuromuscular function and, thus, potentially in predatory performance. Trypsin activity was only influenced by MPs and decreased during exposure to MPs. Elevated temperatures or MPs alone increased the amylase activity but interacted antagonistically. Lipase activity was not influenced by either of the two stressors. In contrast, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was affected by MPs or elevated temperatures alone and decreased with both stressors. Such results indicate deficits in the digestive capabilities of early-stage S. aequifasciatus under elevated temperature conditions and especially during exposure to MPs. Electron transport system (ETS) activity was not influenced by either of the two stressors. Both elevated temperatures and MPs alone increased LDH activity; however, the interaction between the two stressors cancelled activity but was still higher than activity in present conditions. Citrate synthase (CS) activity decreased with elevated temperature but increased during exposure to MPs. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity was only influenced by MPs and increased in the presence of MPs. Thus, S. aequifasciatus juveniles exposed to elevated temperatures and MPs not only relied on anaerobic glycolysis for energy production but also depended on aerobic metabolism in the presence of MPs. Overall, these findings suggested that MPs showed a greater impact than elevated temperatures on the predatory performance, digestion and energy production of S. aequifasciatus. Nevertheless, juvenile survival and growth were minimally impacted, and thus, S. aequifasciatus could cope with near-future temperature increases and MP exposure.

AB  - Microplastic (MP) leads to widespread pollution in the marine ecosystem. In addition to the physical hazard posed by ingestion of microplastic particles, concern is also on their potential as vector for transport of hydrophobic contaminants. We experimentally studied the single and interactive effects of microplastic and pyrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, on the swimming behaviour and predatory performance of juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer). Juveniles (18+ days post hatch) were exposed to MPs, or pyrene (100 nM), or combination of both, and feeding rate and foraging activity (swimming) were analysed. Exposure to MPs alone did not significantly influence feeding performance of the juveniles, while a dose-effect series of pyrene showed strong effect on fish behaviour when concentrations were above 100 nM. In the test of combined MP and pyrene exposure, we observed no effect on feeding while swimming speed decreased significantly. Thus, our results confirm that short-time exposure to pyrene impacts the performance of fish juveniles, while additional exposure to microplastic at the given conditions influenced their activity only and not their feeding rate. Further studies of the combined effects of microplastics and pollutants on tropical fish behaviour are encouraged.

AB  - We examined whether environmentally relevant concentrations of different types of microplastics, with or without PCBs, directly affect freshwater prey and indirectly affect their predators. Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene, polyvinylchloride (PVC) or polystyrene with and without polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) for 28 days. Their predators, white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), were exposed to clams from each treatment for 28 days. In both species, we examined bioaccumulation of PCBs and effects (i.e., immunohistochemistry, histology, behavior, condition, mortality) across several levels of biological organization. PCBs were not detected in prey or predator, and thus differences in bioaccumulation of PCBs among polymers and biomagnification in predators could not be measured. One of the main objectives of this study was to test the hypothesis that bioaccumulation of PCBs would differ among polymer types. Because we could not answer this question experimentally, a bioaccumulation model was run and predicted that concentrations of PCBs in clams exposed to polyethylene and polystyrene would be greater than PET and PVC. Observed effects, although subtle, seemed to be due to microplastics rather than PCBs alone. For example, histopathology showed tubular dilation in clams exposed to microplastics with PCBs, with only mild effects in clams exposed to PCBs alone.

AB  - The present study used red tilapia (Oreochromis niloticusas) as the model fish to compare the interactive effects between aged and virgin microplastics (MPs) with the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and the β-blocker propranolol (PRP). To this end, the ultraviolet irradiation was used to simulate the MP aging in the environment. The accumulations of MPs and pharmaceuticals, and changes in enzyme activities and genes expressions in tilapia were also evaluated. Some physical properties of MPs changed during the aging process, reflected by 0.27- and 0.16-fold increases in the specific surface area and average pore volume, respectively. And more carbonyl formation was observed on the surface of aged MPs. Compared to the 14-d coexposure with virgin MPs, the MP aging increased the accumulation of PRP by 82.3% in the brain, whereas decreased the concentration of SMX by 46.1% in the gills. The stress on tilapia caused by the MPs and PRP was alleviated by the aging process, largely related to the lower neurotoxicity and reduced lipid peroxidation damages. However, the coexposure to aged MPs and SMX would result in higher inhibitions of cytochrome P450 enzymes activities. The results of the transcriptomics showed that the MP aging mainly influenced the expression of genes related to the metabolic process, immune system process, and the genetic information process in tilapia under the coexposure to MPs and pharmaceuticals. Collectively, our results suggest that the MP aging could induce complex changes in the interactive effects between MPs and pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms.

AB  - Plastic nanoparticles originating from weathering plastic waste are emerging contaminants in aquatic environments, with unknown modes of action in aquatic organisms. Recent studies suggest that internalised nanoplastics may disrupt processes related to energy metabolism. Such disruption can be crucial for organisms during development and may ultimately lead to changes in behaviour. Here, we investigated the link between polystyrene nanoplastic (PSNP)-induced signalling events and behavioural changes. Larval zebrafish exhibited PSNP accumulation in the pancreas, which coincided with a decreased glucose level. By using hyperglycemic and glucocorticoid receptor (Gr) mutant larvae, we demonstrate that the PSNP-induced disruption in glucose homoeostasis coincided with increased cortisol secretion and hyperactivity in challenge phases. Our work sheds new light on a potential mechanism underlying nanoplastics toxicity in fish, suggesting that the adverse effect of PSNPs are at least in part mediated by Gr activation in response to disrupted glucose homeostasis, ultimately leading to aberrant locomotor activity.

AB  - Biodegradable plastics (BPs), as alternatives to conventional plastics, are increasingly consumed, but pose potential threats to aquatic ecosystems. In addition, the impact of natural aging on the toxicity of BPs is poorly understood. In this study, the photodegradation of polylactic acid (PLA, a typical BP) microplastics (MPs) under ultraviolet irradiation in water for 90 days was investigated, and the toxicities of virgin and degraded PLA to infantile zebrafish were compared. The results revealed that the size of MPs was reduced from ~25.56 to ~11.22 µm after degradation and nanoparticles were generated with a maximum yield of 7.13%. The formation of abundant oxygen-containing groups (i.e. C˭O and C-O-C) improved the hydrophilia and stability of MPs. Compared with pristine PLA, the efflux and detoxification of degraded PLA mediated by ABC transporters and P450 enzymes were slower, leading to higher bioaccumulation and skeletal development inhibition of zebrafish. Further, oxidative stress-triggered mitochondrial structural damage, depolarization, fission inhibition, and apoptosis were identified as crucial mechanisms underlying the elevated toxicity of PLA after degradation. These findings highlight the importance and necessity of considering natural degradation of BPs and related toxicity, which poses great implications for risk assessment and management of BPs.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs, <5 mm) have been frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems, representing both health and ecological concerns. However data about the combined effects of MPs and other contaminants is still limited. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of MPs and the heavy metal copper (Cu) on zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae development and behavior. Zebrafish embryos were subchronically exposed to MPs (2 mg/L), two sub-lethal concentrations of Cu (60 and 125 µg/L) and binary mixtures of MPs and Cu using the same concentrations, from 2-h post fertilization until 14 days post fertilization. Lethal and sub-lethal responses (mortality, hatching, body length) were evaluated during the embryogenesis period, and locomotor, avoidance, anxiety and shoaling behaviors, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were measured at 14 dpf. The results showed that survival of larvae was reduced in groups exposed to MPs, Cu and Cu+MPs. Regarding the behavioral patterns, the higher Cu concentration and mixtures decreased significantly the mean speed, the total distance traveled and the absolute turn angle, demonstrating an adverse effect on swimming competence of zebrafish larvae. Exposure to MPs and Cu, alone or combined, also affected avoidance behavior of zebrafish, with larvae not reacting to the aversive stimulus. There was a significant inhibition of AChE activity in larvae exposed to all experimental groups, compared to the control group. Moreover, a higher inhibition of AChE was noticed in larvae exposed to MPs and both Cu+MPs groups, comparatively to the Cu alone groups. Our findings demonstrate the adverse effects of MPs, alone or co-exposed with Cu, on fish early life stages behavior. This study highlights that MPs and heavy metals may have significant impacts on fish population fitness by disrupting locomotor and avoidance behaviors.

T2  - Journal of Hazardous Materials
AB  - Although the combined effects of microplastics (MPs) and other organic pollutants have raised increasing attention, the impacts of polymer types on the biological effects (e.g., bioaccumulation and toxicity) of the mixtures are still unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of different polymer types of MPs including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) on the adsorption, accumulation, and toxic effects of triclosan (TCS) in zebrafish. As a result, all three types of MPs could adsorb TCS and PP-MPs has the highest adsorption capacity for TCS (1.18 mg/g). Compared with the TCS alone, MPs changed the distribution of TCS in tissues and increased the accumulation of TCS in the liver and gut following the order of TCS + PP > TCS + PVC > TCS + PE. Compared with individual TCS and PP-MPs, after co-exposed for 28 days, TCS + PP significantly aggravated oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in the liver as well as enhanced neurotoxicity in the brain. Moreover, TCS + PP disturbed the metabolism in the liver and MPs contributed more to the metabolic disorders. The upregulated lipid metabolites (e.g., sphingosine and L-palmitoylcarnitine) and downregulated carbohydrate metabolites (e.g., sucrose) could be potential targets for future risk assessment of MPs combined with other pollutants.

AB  - Nanoplastics with small particle sizes and high surface area/volume ratios easily absorb environmental pollutants and affect their bioavailability. In this study, polystyrene nanoplastic beads (PS-NPBs) with a particle size of 100 nm and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (BMDBM) sunscreen in personal-care products were chosen as target pollutants to study their developmental toxicity and interactive effects on zebrafish embryos. The exposure period was set from 2 to 12 h postfertilization (hpf). BMDBM and PS-NPBs significantly upregulated genes related to antioxidant enzymes and downregulated the gene expression of aromatase and DNA methyltransferases, but the influenced genes were not exactly the same. The combined exposure reduced the adverse effects on the expression of all genes. With the help of the single-cell RNA sequencing technology, neural mid cells were identified as the target cells of both pollutants, and brain development, head development, and the notch signaling pathway were the functions they commonly altered. The key genes and functions that are specifically affected by BMDBM and/or PS-NPBs were identified. BMDBM mainly affects the differentiation and fate of neurons in the central nervous system through the regulation of her5, her6, her11, lfng, pax2a, and fgfr4. The PS-NPBs regulate the expression of olig2, foxg1a, fzd8b, six3a, rx1, lhx2b, nkx2.1a, and sfrp5 to alter nervous system development, retinal development, and stem cell differentiation. The phenotypic responses of zebrafish larvae at 120 hpf were tested, and significant inhibition of locomotor activity was found, indicating that early effects on the central nervous system would have a sustained impact on the behavior of zebrafish.

AB  - As nano- and micro-sized plastics accumulate in the environment and the food chain of animals, including humans, it is imperative to assess the effects of nanoplastics in living organisms in a systematic manner, especially because of their ability to adsorb potential toxicants such as pollutants, heavy metals, and organic macromolecules that coexist in the environment. Using the zebrafish embryo as an animal model, we investigated the bioaccumulation and in vivo toxicity of polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics individually or in combination with the Au ion. We showed that smaller PS nanoplastics readily penetrated the chorion and developing embryos and accumulated throughout the whole body, mostly in lipid-rich regions such as in yolk lipids. We also showed that PS nanoplastics induced only marginal effects on the survival, hatching rate, developmental abnormalities, and cell death of zebrafish embryos but that these effects were synergistically exacerbated by the Au ion in a dose- and size-dependent manner. Such exacerbation of toxicity was well correlated with the production of reactive oxygen species and the pro-inflammatory responses synergized by the presence of PS, supporting the combined toxicity of PS and Au ions. The synergistic effect of PS on toxicity appeared to relate to mitochondrial damage as determined by ultrastructural analysis. Taken together, the effects of PS nanoplastics were marginal but could be a trigger for exacerbating the toxicity induced by other toxicants such as metal ions.

AB  - Nanoplastics (NPs) as pollutants in aquatic environments and as a public health issue due to their accumulation in food chains are of increasing concern. However, previous studies have employed mainly commercial, chemically synthesized polystyrene model particles. Commercial NPs made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is widely used in drinking bottles and packaging, are rarely manufactured, and thus have not been frequently studied in the laboratory. This seriously limits our understanding of their real environmental and biological effects. Herein, we employ a simple method for producing PET NPs directly from plastic bottles, preserving the PET chemical properties, and mimicking the mechanical breakdown process of plastics in nature. Using developing zebrafish embryos as an animal model, we investigate the bioaccumulation and in vivo toxicity of the produced PET NPs, which have diameter sizes of 20, 60–80, and 800 nm and are capped by two dispersing agents, i.e., BSA and SDS. This study demonstrates the size-dependent distribution and the size- and concentration-dependent toxicity of PET NPs in terms of hatching rate, heart rate, and ROS generation. It also reveals that the PETBSA NP treatment groups exhibited higher-level abnormalities in heart rate and more severe oxidative damage than the PETSDS NP treatment groups. Taken together, this work proposes a novel mechanical preparation protocol for PET NPs and provides evidence relating to the toxicity of environmentally relevant NPs towards aquatic organisms.

AB  - As wide-spread pollutants in the marine environment, microplastics (MPs) have raised public concern about potential toxic effects in aquatic organisms, and, among others, MPs were suspected to act as a vector for organic pollutants to biota. The purpose of the present study was to investigate effects by three model pollutants, oxybenzone (BP3), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) adsorbed to polyethylene MPs on the basis of a standard assay, the acute fish embryo toxicity test (FET; OECD TG 236) with zebrafish (Danio rerio) supplemented by additional endpoints such as induction of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, modification of cyp1a gene transcription and changes in larval swimming behavior. FET assays were performed in three laboratories using slightly different husbandry and exposure conditions, which, however, were all fully compatible with the limits defined by OECD TG 236. This allowed for testing of potential changes in the FET assay due to protocol variations. The standard endpoints of the FET (acute embryotoxicity) did not reveal any acute toxicity for both virgin MPs and MPs spiked with BP3, BaP, and PFOS. With respect to sublethal endpoints, EROD activity was increased after exposure to MPs spiked with BP3 (3 h pulse) and MPs spiked with BaP (96 h continuous exposure). Cyp1a transcription was increased upon exposure to MPs spiked with BP3 or BaP. For the selected combination of MPs particles and contaminants, the basic FET proved not sensitive enough to reveal effects of (virgin and spiked) MPs. However, given that the FET can easily be supplemented by a broad variety of more subtle and sensitive endpoints, an enhanced FET protocol may provide a relevant approach with developmental stages of a vertebrate animal model, which is not protected by current EU animal welfare legislation (Directive EU 2010/63).

AB  - Microplastic (MP) pollution is a key global environmental issue and laboratory exposure studies on aquatic biota are proliferating at an exponential rate. However, most research is limited to treatment-level effects, ignoring that there may be substantial within-population variation in responses to anthropogenic stressors. MP exposure experiments often reveal considerable, yet largely overlooked, inter-individual variation in particle uptake within concentration treatments. Here, we investigated to what degree treatment-level responses to MP exposure may be affected by variation in MP ingestion rates in the early life stages of a marine fish, the Gilt-head seabream, Sparus aurata. First, we tested whether MP ingestion variation is repeatable. Second, we assessed to what degree this variation may determine individual-level effects of MP exposure on fitness-related behavioural performance (i.e., escape response). We found that consistent inter-individual variation in MP ingestion was prevalent and led to differential impacts within exposure treatments. Individuals with high MP ingestion rates exhibited markedly inferior escape responses, a result that was partially concealed in treatment-level analyses. Our findings show that the measured response of populations to environmental perturbations could be confounded by variation in individual-level responses and that the explicit integration of MP ingestion variation can reveal cryptic patterns during exposure experiments.

AB  - The toxicity of polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) and ZnO nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), in combination is poorly known. Thus, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects of PS NPs (760 μg/L) on Ctenopharyngodon idella exposed to it, both in separate and in combination with ZnO NPs (760 μg/L), based on behavioral, biochemical and genotoxic biomarkers. Current data have indicated that PS NPs, for a short exposure period (3 days), both in separate and in combination with nanoparticles, have affected animals' response to the mirror test. On the other hand, all treatments have equally induced C. idella inactivity towards alarm substances and DNA damage. There was increased oxidative stress, mainly in groups exposed to PS NPs (in combination, or not, with nanoparticles); although increased, the evaluated antioxidant levels did not appear to be enough to inhibit the effects of treatment-induced production of free radicals. Together, these results are likely co-responsible for the observed changes. The current study did not observe antagonistic, synergistic or additive effect on animals exposed to the combination between PS NPs and ZnO NPs; however, this outcome should not discourage the performance of similar studies focused on assessing the (eco)toxicity of pollutant mixtures comprising nanomaterials.

AB  - The aquatic environment is outrageously littered with resin pellets and particles of plastic origin which can jeopardise the health of aquatic organisms. The present study investigated the effect of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microparticles on blood parameters, leucocytes, lipid peroxidation and antioxidant system (brain and gill) of Clarias gariepinus. C. gariepinus is a fresh water indicator species often used as model for ecotoxicological assay. Fish specimens were exposed to diets spiked with PVC microparticles (95.41 ± 4.23 μm) at the following concentrations; 0.50%, 1.50% and 3.0% and control diet for 45 days, followed by a depuration trial which lasted for 30 days. Blood and tissues (brain and gill) were sampled every 15 days interval for haematology, antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation assay. The result obtained revealed that PVC orchestrated the marked alterations in haematological indices. Mean cell volume and mean cell haemoglobin values reduced significantly in all concentration treated groups and were time-dependent. Neutrophil counts decreased with a corresponding increase in PVC exposure time while lymphocytes and monocytes values showed no significant difference between the control and exposed fish groups. Glutathione peroxidase activity was altered substantially in the brain and gill of the exposed groups compared to the control. Superoxide dismutase activity was inhibited in the brain and gill of the exposed groups compared to the control, as well as the different exposed periods. Catalase activity reduced significantly in the brain of 0.5% PVC exposed groups, and also decreased in a time-dependent manner while its activity in the gill did not change significantly among the exposed groups relative to the control. Lipid peroxidation levels in the brain of PVC exposed groups increased significantly in a dose and time-dependent manner. However, PVC caused no significantly change in the gill lipid peroxidation level of the exposed fish, but elevated the lipid peroxidation levels as the exposure time increased. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain and gill of the exposed fish reduced substantially with increase in the exposure time. Variations in haematology, antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation and acetylcholinesterase activities are indicative of oxidative stress and neurotoxicity in fish. C. gariepinus is an indispensable bioindicator to measure environmental impact of PVC microparticles.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) were found to modulate the toxicity of other pollutants but the knowledge on the topic is still limited. The goals of this study were to investigate the short-term toxicity of cadmium (Cd) to wild Pomatochistus microps juveniles, the potential modulation of acute Cd toxicity by 1-5 µm polyethylene MPs in this species, and possible differences of sensitivity to Cd and MPs-Cd mixtures between juveniles from two distinct wild populations. Juveniles were collected in the estuaries of Minho (M-est) and Lima (L-est) Rivers (NW Portugal). One 96 h bioassay with M-est juveniles and another one with L-est juveniles were carried out in laboratory conditions. Each bioassay had 12 treatments: control, 5 Cd concentrations, 1 MPs concentration, and 5 MPs-Cd mixtures. No significant differences in Cd-induced mortality between juveniles from distinct estuaries or between juveniles exposed to Cd alone and those exposed to MPs-Cd mixtures were found. The total 96h LC10 and LC50 of Cd alone were 2 mg/L (95% CI: 0-4 mg/L) and 8 mg/L (95% CI: 2-17 mg/L), respectively. Cd alone significantly decreased the post-exposure predatory performance (PEPP) of M-est (≥6 mg/L) and L-est juveniles (≥3 mg/L), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of M-est juveniles (13 mg/L). MPs alone (0.14 mg/L) significantly reduced the PEPP and AChE activity of L-est juveniles but not of M-est juveniles. MPs-Cd mixtures (3-13 mg/L of Cd + 0.14 mg/L of MPs) significantly inhibited the PEPP of juveniles from both estuaries and AChE of L-est estuary juveniles but not of M-est juveniles. Evidences of toxicological interactions, namely antagonism, between MPs and Cd were found. Overall, the results indicate that MPs modulated the sub-lethal toxic effects of Cd in wild P. microps juveniles, especially neurotoxicity. Moreover, the environmental conditions of the natural habitats to which juveniles were exposed during pre-developmental phases influence the sub-lethal toxicity of Cd, MPs, and their mixtures. The implications to environmental and human risk assessment are discussed and further research is needed.

AB  - Although the toxicity of conventional microplastic types (i.e., petroleum derivatives) in different organisms is already known, knowledge about the effects of alternative biopolymers on aquatic vertebrates remains incipient. Thus, the aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that the exposure of adult Danio rerio individuals to this pollutant for 30 days is enough to cause polylactic acid biomicroplastics (BioMPs of PLA) accumulation in their bodies, which leads to behavioral/neurotoxic, biochemical, and morphological changes. Based on our results, PLA BioMPs at concentrations of 2.5 and 5 mg/L accumulated in the liver, brain, gills and carcass of the assessed animals. However, such an accumulation was not able to cause locomotor damages or to trigger anxiety-like behavior in them. On the other hand, it was enough to cause behavioral changes (in shoal) predictive of co-specific social interaction and anti-predatory defensive response deficit likely related to cholinergic changes inferred by increased acetylcholinesterase activity and REDOX imbalance. This imbalance was featured by increased production of reactive species. We observed that the treatments have affected animals’ pigmentation pattern. Therefore, our study highlights the toxicological potential of the herein assessed biopolymer, and this finding puts in check the innocuousness of this material, as well as expands our knowledge about how PLA BioMPs can affect the ichthyofauna in freshwater environments.

AB  - A major challenge in nanoecotoxicology is finding suitable methods to determine the uptake and localisation of nanoparticles on a whole-organism level. Some uptake methods have been associated with artefacts induced by sample preparation, including staining for electron microscopy. This study used light sheet microscopy (LSM) to define the uptake and localisation of fluorescently labelled nanoparticles in living organisms with minimal sample preparation. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to fluorescent gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) and fluorescent polystyrene NPs via aqueous or dietary exposure. The in vivo uptake and localisation of NPs were investigated using LSM at different time points (1, 3 and 7 days). A time-dependent increase in fluorescence was observed in the gut after dietary exposure to both Au NPs and polystyrene NPs. No fluorescence was observed within gut epithelia regardless of the NP exposure route indicating no or limited uptake via intestinal villi. Fish exposed to polystyrene NPs through the aqueous phase emitted fluorescence signals from the gills and intestine. Fluorescence was also detected in the head region of the fish after aqueous exposure to polystyrene NPs. This was not observed for Au NPs. Aqueous exposure to Au NPs resulted in increased relative swimming distance, while no effect was observed for other exposures. This study supports that the route of exposure is essential for the uptake and subsequent localisation of nanoparticles in zebrafish. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the localisation of NPs in whole living organisms can be visualised in real-time, using LSM.

AB  - The physical and chemical properties of nanoplastics make them potential carriers for some environmental contaminants, modifying their biological effects. Nevertheless, the change in toxicity caused by pollutant adsorption on nanoplastics is still controversial, depending on the interactions between chemical and physical pollutants, the consequent change in bioavailability, the modification of intake, transport and accumulation in the organisms and also on the characteristics of contaminants. In this context, the aim of the present study was the evaluation of combined effects made by 0.5 μm nanobeads of polystyrene and triclosan adsorbed on their surface in comparison with those caused by single contaminants. The systemic effects of 7 day exposure to nanoplastics, triclosan alone and to the nanoplastic–triclosan complex have been analyzed by employing zebrafish larvae and using a multi-tier approach from the evaluation of cellular and molecular effects to the impact at organism level. Results highlighted by confocal microscopy evidenced nanobead ingestion and translocation in several tissues and organs to guarantee the goodness of the exposure results. Behavioral assays were then conducted to highlight larval swimming defects as a ‘real-time’ readout of the potential effects on the whole organism, while a suite of several biomarkers and functional proteomics was applied to investigate the effects at both cellular and molecular levels. The whole data set pointed out a clear modification in the toxicological effects of the nanoplastic–triclosan complex in comparison with single contaminants, proved by opposite behaviours in the larval swimming activity and modulation of diverse protein classes as well as by different effects on several biochemical endpoints. This means that the interaction between chemical and physical pollutants leads to more complicated responses than additive, synergistic or antagonist models, resulting in a modification of toxicity instead of its increase or decrease.

T2  - Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety
AB  - Microplastics have been frequently detected in both marine and freshwater ecosystems. Their impact on aquatic organisms has raised much concern. This study investigated the impact of microplastics on zebrafish embryos and larvae, with a special focus on their swimming competence. The zebrafish embryos were exposed to microplastics starting from 4 h post fertilization. Microplastics first adhered to the embryo chorion, then entered the stomach and intestinal tract of the larvae later. In the free swimming test, exposure to 1000 μg/L (around 1.91 × 107 particles/L) of microplastics led to a significant decrease in both swimming distance and speed of zebrafish larvae under the dark condition by 3.2% and 3.5% respectively. In the alternating light-to-dark photoperiod stimulation assay, exposure to 100 and 1000 μg/L (around 1.91 × 106 and 1.91 × 107 particles/L) of microplastics caused a 4.6% and 2.6% decrease in swimming distance, and reduced the active speed by 4.9% and 2.8%, possibly as a result of inhibited dark avoidance in treated zebrafish larvae. At the molecular level, exposure to microplastics induced upregulated expression of inflammation (il1b) and oxidative stress (cat) related genes. This study demonstrates that exposure to microplastics significantly decreases larvae swimming competence, which may have significant impacts on its population fitness in the aquatic environment and further ecological consequences.

AB  - Microplastics and mercury are environmental pollutants of great concern. The main goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of these pollutants, both individually and in binary mixtures, on the swimming performance of juvenile European seabass, Dicentrarchus labrax. Microplastics alone, mercury alone and all the mixtures caused significant reduction of the swimming velocity and resistance time of fish. Moreover, changes in behavioural responses including lethargic and erratic swimming behaviour were observed. These results highlight that fish behavioural responses can be used as sensitive endpoint to establish the effects of contamination by microplastics and also emphasizes the need to assess the combined effects of microplastics and other environmental contaminants, with special attention to the effects on behavioural responses in fish and other aquatic species.

AU  - Critchell, Kay

T2  - PloS One
AB  - The effect of a pollutant on the base of the food web can have knock-on effects for trophic structure and ecosystem functioning. In this study we assess the effect of microplastic exposure on juveniles of a planktivorous fish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus), a species that is widespread and abundant on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Under five different plastic concentration treatments, with plastics the same size as the natural food particles (mean 2mm diameter), there was no significant effect of plastic exposure on fish growth, body condition or behaviour. The amount of plastics found in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract was low, with a range of one to eight particles remaining in the gut of individual fish at the end of a 6-week plastic-exposure period, suggesting that these fish are able to detect and avoid ingesting microplastics in this size range. However, in a second experiment the number of plastics in the GI tract vastly increased when plastic particle size was reduced to approximately one quarter the size of the food particles, with a maximum of 2102 small (< 300μm diameter) particles present in the gut of individual fish after a 1-week plastic exposure period. Under conditions where food was replaced by plastic, there was a negative effect on the growth and body condition of the fish. These results suggest plastics could become more of a problem as they break up into smaller size classes, and that environmental changes that lead to a decrease in plankton concentrations combined with microplastic presence is likely have a greater influence on fish populations than microplastic presence alone.

AB  - Microplastics (MP) are ubiquitous in the marine environment and have been shown to alter the behaviour of some species due to potential neurotoxic effect. However, very little is known on the effect of this stressor on behavioural responses of early and more vulnerable life stages. This study explores the effects of polystyrene MP (90 µm diameter) on the foraging activity of newly settled surgeonfish Acanthurus triostegus and on their survival facing predators. Exposure to a high concentration of 5 MP particles per mL (5 MP mL-1) for 3, 5 and 8 days did not alter their foraging activity nor their susceptibility to predation. This suggests that short-term exposures to reportedly high MP concentrations have negligible effects on the behaviour of newly settled A. triostegus. Nevertheless, responses to MP can be highly variable, and further research is needed to determine potential ecological effects of MP on reef fish populations during early-life stages.

AB  - Microplastics (MP) are emerging contaminants widely found in aquatic ecosystems. In addition to MP toxicity itself, there is increasing concern about the MP adsorption capacity and the interactive effects with other contaminants, such as copper. The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of polyethylene microplastic and its association with copper (Cu) in genotoxic, biochemical, and physiological biomarkers of the neotropical teleost Prochilodus lineatus. Fish were exposed for 24 and 96 h to MP (20 μg L-1) and Cu (10 μg L-1) and MP + Cu. The results showed that MP and Cu, both isolated and in combination, promoted DNA damage in erythrocytes (96 h) and liver cells (24 and 96 h) indicating that MP and Cu are genotoxic. Fish exposed only to Cu (96 h) showed a decrease in lipid peroxidation in the liver despite of the decrease in glutathione content, indicating the efficiency of other antioxidant defenses. Brain acetylcholinesterase was inhibited in the animals from all the treatments. Although MP did not influence on Cu accumulation in tissues, decreased plasma Na+ and Ca2+ (24 h) occurred after the exposure to MP and Cu, isolated and combined. Exposure to MP and MP + Cu resulted in decreased activity of Ca2+-ATPase (24 h). Taken altogether, these results showed that MP and Cu depicted genotoxic, neurotoxic, and physiological effects on P. lineatus, both alone and combined. An interaction between Cu and MP was observed in plasma Ca2+, where the combination of both contaminants caused a greater effect than the contaminants alone.

AB  - The role of polyethylene microplastics 4-6 μm size (MPs) in the toxicity of environmental compounds to fish early life stages (ELS) was investigated. Marine medaka Oryzias melastigma embryos and larvae were exposed to suspended MPs spiked with three model contaminants: benzo(a)pyrene (MP-BaP), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (MP-PFOS) and benzophenone-3 (MP-BP3) for 12 days. There was no evidence of MPs ingestion but MPs agglomerated on the surface of the chorion. Fish ELS exposed to virgin MPs did not show toxic effects. Exposure to MP-PFOS decreased embryonic survival and prevented hatching. Larvae exposed to MP-BaP or MP-BP3 exhibited reduced growth, increased developmental anomalies and abnormal behavior. Compared to equivalent waterborne concentrations, BaP and PFOS appeared to be more embryotoxic when spiked on MPs than when alone in seawater. These results suggest a relevant pollutant transfer by direct contact of MPs to fish ELS that should be included in the ecotoxicological risk assessment of MPs.

AB  - Nanoplastics (NPs) and microplastics (MPs) are a heterogeneous class of pollutants with diverse sizes in aquatic environments. To evaluate the hazardous effects of N/MPs with different sizes, the accumulation, oxidative stress, cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, neurotoxicity, and metabolomics changes were investigated in the red tilapia exposed to three sizes of polystyrene (PS) N/MPs (0.3, 5, and 70 − 90 μm). After 14-d exposures, the largest particles (70 − 90 μm) showed the highest accumulation levels in most cases. Exposures to PS-MPs (5 and 70 − 90 μm) caused a more severe oxidative stress in red tilapia than PS-NPs. The activity of CYP3A-related enzyme was obviously inhibited by PS-NPs, whereas the CYP enzymes in the liver may not be sensitive to MP exposures. In the brain, only 5 μm PS-MPs significantly inhibited the acetylcholinesterase activity. After exposures, the treatments with 0.3, 5, and 70 − 90 μm N/MPs resulted in 31, 40, and 23 significantly differentially expressed metabolites, respectively, in which the pathway of tyrosine metabolism was significantly affected by all the three PS-N/MP exposures. Overall, the PS particles within the μm size posed more severe stress to red tilapia. Our results suggest that the toxicity of N/MPs may not show a simply monotonic negative correlation with their sizes.

AB  - The substantial increase in the occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in the aquatic ecosystem has been recognized as an emerging concern today. Studies have revealed the toxicity of microplastics on behavior, physiology, and reproduction of fishes. Despite several reports, there are inadequate literature reports on the impact of microplastics on aquatic forms at the molecular level. The present study was aimed to investigate the adverse effects of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) in adult zebrafish model system. Healthy fishes were exposed to different concentrations (10 and 100 μg L-1) of PS-MPs for 35 d. The results revealed that PS-MPs exposure induced ROS (Reactive oxygen species) generation disrupting the antioxidant defense system, hepatic enzymology, and neurotransmission. Correspondingly, the histological studies showed PS-MPs induced histopathological lesions, including inflammation, degeneration, necrosis, and hemorrhage, in the brain and liver tissues of zebrafish. Furthermore, PS-MPs exposure significantly upregulated the expressions of gstp1, hsp70l, and ptgs2a gene along with the downregulation of cat, sod1, gpx1a, and ache genes. Therefore, the present study illustrates the potential of PS-MPs to induce different grades of toxic impacts in fishes by altering its metabolic mechanism, histological architecture, and gene regulation pattern through ROS induced oxidative stress.

AB  - The biometric, behavioral and biochemical toxicity of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS NPs) in aquatic freshwater vertebrates and in environmentally relevant concentrations remains poorly known. Thus, using different toxicity biomarkers we tested the hypothesis that the exposure of Ctenopharyngodon idella juveniles to small PS NPs concentrations (0.04 ng/L, 34 ng/L and 34 μg/L), for a short period-of-time, may affect their growth/development, individual and collective behavior, and biochemical parameters. Animals exposed to NPs did not show increased biometric parameters (i.e.: body biomass, total and standard length, peduncle height, head height and visceral somatic and hepatosomatic indices). Despite the lack of damage on the locomotor (open field test) and visual (visual stimulus test) abilities of the evaluated fish, the expected increase in locomotor activity during the vibratory stimulus test was not evident in animals exposed to NPs. Non-exposed animals were the only ones showing increased activity/locomotion time in the presence of the predatory stimulus during the individual anti-predatory response test. The behavior of animals directly confronted with a potential predator has evidenced the influence of NPs on shoals' aggregation and on the distance kept by individuals from the predatory stimulus. These changes were associated with PS NPs accumulation in animals' brains, oxidative stress and increased acetylcholinesterase activity (hepatic and cerebral). Therefore, the current study has confirmed the initial hypothesis and showed that, even at low concentrations, PS NPs can affect the health of C. idella individuals at early life stage.

AB  - Increasing global research has identified microplastics (MPs) to be impacting marine organisms. The present work aimed at investigating the physiological and behavioral effects of thirty-six juvenile Sparus aurata exposed to control, virgin and weathered MPs enriched diets during a 21-day period under controlled conditions. Physiological effects were assessed in liver and brain using the following biomarkers: activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GRd), the detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) and malondialdehyde (MDA) as indicative of lipid peroxidation. Individuals were recorded for behavior analysis (i.e. social interactions and feeding behavior). Results revealed an increase in cellular stress from control to weathered fish groups, with the virgin group showing intermediate levels in all quantified biomarkers. Significant differences were found in the liver for all biomarkers except for MDA, suggesting that exposure time to MPs in this experiment is long enough to trigger the activation of antioxidant enzymes but not to produce cell damage by lipid peroxidation. In brain tissue samples, fish from the weathered group presented significantly higher values for CAT and SOD, highlighting its function as primary antioxidants. Regarding behavioral effects, results showed that the two MPs enriched groups were significantly bolder during social interactions and, although no significantly, tended to be more active during feeding. In conclusion, MPs which have been weathered in marine environmental conditions produces a higher physiological response than virgin MPs but also, a physiological response is variable depending on the tissue analyzed. In addition, a short period to MP exposure seems to affect overall social and feeding behavior but, further research is needed to assess long-term effects of MP ingestion and its potential consequences on fish populations.

AB  - The evaluation of the interaction between microplastics (MPs) and heavy metals is of special importance for risk assessment. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to MPs (2 mg/L), two sub-lethal concentrations of copper (Cu, 60 and 125 μg/L) and their mixtures (Cu60 + MPs, Cu125 + MPs), from 2-h post-fertilization (hpf) until 14-days post-fertilization (dpf). Lethal and sublethal endpoints were evaluated, along with a set of biochemical and genetic biomarkers between 2 and 14 dpf. Exposure to MPs and Cu, single or combined, induced high mortality and oxidative stress in zebrafish larvae, with data showing that the antioxidant enzymes were inhibited at 6 dpf, increasing thereafter until 14 dpf, due to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. MPs and Cu, single or combined, caused neurotoxicity in larvae by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity. There was an increased and significant effect of Cu + MPs groups on the evaluated biomarkers, concerning the corresponding Cu groups, suggesting that MPs may have a synergistic effect in relation to Cu. The Integrated Biomarker Response (IBR) evidenced that a higher degree of stress occurred at the larval period. Our findings highlight that MPs can act as a vector for heavy metals, therefore, influencing their bioavailability and toxicity in the organisms.

AB  - Plastic marine debris hyper-concentrates hydrophobic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and can transfer these sorbed contaminants to biota following ingestion. PAHs are known to induce cardiotoxicity and visual toxicity at sublethal doses. Juvenile White seabass (Atractoscion nobilis) fish were fed environmentally relevant concentrations of either virgin polystyrene or benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)-sorbed polystyrene for 5 days and were monitored for changes in phototactic response, swimming behavior, and hepatic cytochrome p450 1A (CYP1A) enzyme activity. No significant differences in the monitored endpoints were recorded in fish that ingested either polystyrene or BaP-sorbed polystyrene relative to control fish following the short-term exposure. However, fish exposed to 252 μg/L BaP alone as a positive control had significantly elevated CYP1A enzyme activity (p = 0.046) and impaired phototactic response (p = 0.020), though no altered swimming behavior was observed (p = 0.843) relative to control fish. These results demonstrate that pelagic fish ingesting environmentally relevant concentrations of BaP-sorbed polystyrene for a short, 5-day duration do not demonstrate measurable changes in vision, swimming activity, nor CYP1A activity. High variability within enzyme activity and behavioral responses suggest that lack of significant effects may be due to low sample size.

AB  - Microplastics pollution is a global paradigm that raises concern in relation to environmental and human health. This study investigated toxic effects of microplastics and mercury in the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), a marine fish widely used as food for humans. A short-term (96 h) laboratory bioassay was done by exposing juvenile fish to microplastics (0.26 and 0.69 mg/L), mercury (0.010 and 0.016 mg/L) and binary mixtures of the two substances using the same concentrations, through test media. Microplastics alone and mercury alone caused neurotoxicity through acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, increased lipid oxidation (LPO) in brain and muscle, and changed the activities of the energy-related enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). All the mixtures caused significant inhibition of brain AChE activity (64-76%), and significant increase of LPO levels in brain (2.9-3.4 fold) and muscle (2.2-2.9 fold) but not in a concentration-dependent manner; mixtures containing low and high concentrations of microplastics caused different effects on IDH and LDH activity. Mercury was found to accumulate in the brain and muscle, with bioaccumulation factors of 4-7 and 25-40, respectively. Moreover, in the analysis of mercury concentrations in both tissues, a significant interaction between mercury and microplastics was found. The decay of mercury in the water increased with microplastics concentration, and was higher in the presence of fish than in their absence. Overall, these results indicate that: microplastics influence the bioaccumulation of mercury by D. labrax juveniles; microplastics, mercury and their mixtures (ppb range concentrations) cause neurotoxicity, oxidative stress and damage, and changes in the activities of energy-related enzymes in juveniles of this species; mixtures with the lowest and highest concentrations of their components induced different effects on some biomarkers. These findings and other published in the literature raise concern regarding high level predators and humans consuming fish being exposed to microplastics and heavy metals, and highlight the need of more research on the topic.

AB  - Microplastics are major pollutants in marine environment and may have health effects on aquatic organisms. In this study, we used two sizes (5 and 50 μm diameter) of fluorescent and virgin polystyrene microplastics to analyze the adverse effects on larval zebrafish. In our study, we evaluated the effects on larval zebrafish after exposure to 100 and 1000 μg/L of two sizes of polystyrene microplastics for 7 days. Our results show that polystyrene microplastics could cause alterations in the microbiome at the phylum and genus levels in larval zebrafish, including changes in abundance and diversity of the microbiome. In addition, metabolomic analysis suggested that exposure to polystyrene microplastics induced alterations of metabolic profiles in larval zebrafish, and differential metabolites were involved in energy metabolism, glycolipid metabolism, inflammatory response, neurotoxic response, nucleic acid metabolism, oxidative stress. Polystyrene microplastics also significantly decreased the activities of catalase and the content of glutathione. In addition, the results of gene transcription analysis showed that exposure to polystyrene microplastics induced changes in glycolysis-related genes and lipid metabolism-related genes, confirming that polystyrene microplastics disturbed glycolipid and energy metabolism. Taken together, the results obtained in the present study indicated that the potential effects of environmental microplastics on aquatic organisms should not be ignored.

AB  - Plastics are ubiquitous anthropogenic contaminants that are a growing concern in aquatic environments. The ecological implications of macroplastics pollution are well documented, but less is known about nanoplastics. The current study investigates the potential adverse effects of nanoplastics, which likely contribute to the ecological burden of plastic pollution. To this end, we examined whether a dietary exposure of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) to polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) could lead to the transfer of nanoplastics to the offspring, and whether nanoplastics exposure affects zebrafish physiology. Specifically, adult female and male zebrafish (F0 generation) were exposed to PS NPs via diet for one week and bred to produce the F1 generation. Four F1 groups were generated: control (unexposed females and males), maternal (exposed females), paternal (exposed males), and co-parental (exposed males and females). Co-parental PS NP exposure did not significantly affect reproductive success. Assessment of tissues from F0 fish revealed that exposure to PS NPs significantly reduced glutathione reductase activity in brain, muscle, and testes, but did not affect mitochondrial function parameters in heart or gonads. Assessment of F1 embryos and larvae revealed that PS NPs were present in the yolk sac, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and pancreas of the maternally and co-parentally exposed F1 embryos/larvae. Bradycardia was also observed in embryos from maternal and co-parental exposure groups. In addition, the activity of glutathione reductase and the levels of thiols were reduced in F1 embryos/larvae from maternal and/or co-parental exposure groups. Mitochondrial function and locomotor activity were not affected in F1 larvae. This study demonstrates that (i) PS NPs are transferred from mothers to offspring, and (ii) exposure to PS NPs modifies the antioxidant system in adult tissues and F1 larvae. We conclude that PS NPs could bioaccumulate and be passed on to the offspring, but this does not lead to major physiological disturbances.

AB  - The importance of attention to unravel the interaction of nano-plastic particles (NPs) with natural acidic organic polymer (NAOP) in freshwater environment should not be neglected. However, toxicological data available for the interaction between NPs and NAOP remain limited. Here, we investigate the toxicological effects of three model polystyrene (PS) NPs with different functional groups (unmodified, amino- and carboxyl-modified PS NPs) on two freshwater organisms of different trophic levels (Scenedesmus obliquus and Danio rerio) in the absence and presence of two classes of NAOP, namely fulvic acid and humic acid. The NAOP interaction with the NPs is shown to alter oxidative stress and disturb membrane function in S. obliquus cells to a certain extent. Combined oxidative stress responses to the NPs and NAOP in D. rerio as a function of their mixture levels showed inhibition, alleviation, and reinforce. Changes in cellular oxidative stress and membrane function depended on the concentration and types of both NPs and NAOP. Furthermore, the characterization parameters of the NPs were important for the explanation of the ecotoxicological mechanism of the NPs in the presence of NAOP. Our findings emphasized the critical role of NAOP in the fate and toxicity of plastic particles in freshwater environment.

AB  - The widespread use of polystyrene (PS) products in a myriad of consumer products has resulted in widespread contamination of PS nanoplastics (PSNPs) in aquatic ecosystems. Fish early life stages are exposed to nanoplastics dermally and via gills. Additional routes of exposure include oral via the ingestion of contaminated prey and maternal transfer. However, there is limited amount of work studying the impact of exposure route in the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of PSNPs. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of exposure routes (aqueous and microinjection) on the organ distribution and toxicity of PSNPs. We "mimicked" the maternal exposure of PSNPs to zebrafish by injecting a known concentration of fluorescent particles directly into 2-cell stage embryos. Endpoints were collected starting at 96 h post-fertilization until several weeks post-hatch to evaluate depuration. Although both exposure routes led to the accumulation of PSNPs in the yolk sac followed by brain, eyes, gut and swim bladder, the aqueous exposure caused higher PSNP concentrations in the brain and eyes and the injection exposure caused PSNP accumulation mainly in the trunk area. A waterborne exposure also reduced antioxidant gene expression; increased frequency of developmental abnormalities such as bent tails, jaw deformities and pericardial edema; and resulted in lower growth rates and hypoactivity. Overall, a waterborne exposure to PSNPs resulted in higher transfer to the brain and caused greater toxic effects to zebrafish compared to an injection exposure and highlights the key role of exposure routes in the uptake, localization and subsequent distribution of nanoparticles.
