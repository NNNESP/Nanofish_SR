However, current data regarding microplastics in wild organisms in different trophic levels is limited. This study investigated microplastic characteristics, including their abundance, size, shape and polymer type, in estuarine invertebrates and vertebrates. Resultantly, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were the predominant microplastics found, as confirmed by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR). An average microplastic abundance of 0.83 Â± 0.99 to 3.87 Â± 2.18 items/individual was detected across all species, including sandworm, mollusks, crustacean and fish, but they were not found in all individuals. Microplastics ranged from 52 Î¼m to 5392 Î¼m in size, and the shapes were consisted of fiber, fragment, and pellet. Moreover, the detection ratio (91.95%) and abundance (3.34 Â± 2.17 items/individual) of microplastics in fish were significantly higher than in sandworm (42.86%, 0.88 Â± 1.04 items/individual), mollusks (66.97%, 1.42 Â± 1.41 items/individual) and crustaceans (66.66%, 1.33 Â± 1.32 items/individual) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, a positive relationship was identified between microplastic abundance and the trophic level of organisms. These findings imply that microplastics might transfer along the food chain and accumulate at organisms in higher trophic levels.

Moreover, PS-NPs exposure accelerated SGIV replication in the spleen and RGNNV replication in the brain. PS-NP exposure also decreased the expression of toll-like receptor genes and interferon-related genes before and after virus invasion in vitro and in vivo, thus reducing the resistance of cells and tissues to viral replication. This is the first report that PS-NPs have toxic effects on GS cells and spleen and brain tissues, and it provides new insights into assessing the impact of PS-NPs on marine fish.

As a consequence of these corrections, none of the bisphenol levels would lead to an exceedance of the EFSA Tolerable Daily Intake TDI (4 Î¼g/kg of body weight (BW) per day ). Contrary, all THQs and HIs are orders of magnitude below 1. We apologize for those errors and potential misleading to our readers. In order to result in a correct overall unit for EDI of Âµg/kg body weight/day (EFSA, 2015), the Eq.

The calculation of the respective bisphenol dose, the BPA, BPB and BPE measured concentration in fish muscle (measured in dry weight) has been converted to the respective concentration of BPA, BPB and BPE in wet weight.

The prevalence of microplastics (MPs) elucidated diffuse sources namely long-range transport, domestic, agricultural, fishing, industrial and recreational activities and the local climatic conditions. Seasonally, the mean abundances of MPs in both water and sediments were high during Nortes (strong winds) followed by the dry and rainy seasons. Overall, black and blue colored MPs dominated the region and all the recovered plastics were fibers. The commercial fishes (n = 187) contained 881 MPs in their gastrointestinal tracts, suggesting that the food web of the estuary is highly prone to microplastic contamination. SEM images of extracted plastic fibers presented surface morphologies that are impacted by physical strains. Further, the elemental characterization of fibers using EDX displayed significant peaks of Al, As, Cl, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn that were used as additives during the production of plastics. The main types of polymers included low-density polyethylene, polyester, polypropylene, polycarbonate, rayon, polyvinyl chloride, polyacrylonitrile, polyamide, nylon and polyethylene terephthalate. MP abundances demonstrated in this study elucidate that estuaries are a major conduit for land-derived plastics to the ocean and the results will aid in implementing remedial/clean up actions of the estuary for better conservation of the ecosystem.

However, little is known about the size-dependent retention time of these inert particles. To approach this question, the retention time of MP particles was examined in two freshwater fish species with distinct differences in gastrointestinal morphology: rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with a true stomach, and stomachless common carp (Cyprinus carpio). A special diet was developed that contained environmentally relevant concentrations of MPs with sizes ranging from 20 to 1,000Â Âµm. The two species were exposed to three different concentrations and numbers of retained particle were determined up to 72Â hr after administration. The results revealed significant differences in retention time between large and small MP particles in rainbow trout, in which the T50 value (time for 50% of particles to be evacuated) ranged from 12.1Â hr for 42.7Â Âµm particles to 4.0Â hr for 1,086Â Âµm particles. In contrast, the differences observed between sizes in common carp were considerably smaller, with T50 ranging from 7.3Â hr for 42.7Â Âµm particles to 4.6Â hr for 1,086Â Âµm particles. It is therefore concluded that large particles in rainbow trout must be actively transported out of the stomach, as the evacuation times are significantly shorter than those for food. Small particles, however, are passively excreted with the chyme. In common carp, the evacuation rates of all particle sizes were in the range of that for food, suggesting a passive excretion. The results are particularly relevant in the contexts of particle transfer through the food chain, the release of toxic chemicals, and the translocation into tissues and organs. For this reason, it is essential that the particle size is given more consideration in future studies of microplastics in aquatic environments. Â© 2021 The Authors.

This increase in personal protective equipment (PPE) production and consumption is an efficient tool to address the spread of COVIDâ€19. However, this results in more plastic and micro-plastic debris being added into the land and marine environments, which will harm the ecosystem, wildlife, and public health. Such a situation needs deep individual behavior observation and track-ing, as well as an assessment of the potential environmental impact of this new type of waste. For this reason, we assessed the Moroccan populationâ€™s behavior regarding the use and disposal of facemasks and gloves. An exploratory survey was prepared and shared via social media and email with the population of Rabatâ€SalÃ©â€KÃ©nitra and Casablancaâ€Settat regions. Additionally, we calcu-lated the estimated number and weight of daily and weekly PPE used and generated by the studied regions. The survey showed that 70% of the respondents threw their discarded masks and gloves in house trash or trash bins after their first use, whereas nearly 30% of respondents admitted that they did not wear masks because they did not leave their homes during the lockdown, while from the 70% of facemask users, more than five million (equivalent to 40,000 kg) of facemasks would be generated and disposed of daily by the community of these regions, which presents 35% of the total engendered facemask waste in Morocco. Accordingly, the environment impact of facemasks showed that the greenhouse gas footprint is about 640 kT CO2 eq./year for the whole of Morocco, while the energy footprint is around 60,000 GWh/year. Furthermore, an urgent multidisciplinary environmental assessment of the potential impact of PPE must be conducted among the 12 Moroccan regions. This study demonstrated the real impact of the COVIDâ€19 PPE on human behavior and the environment and suggests a need for providing new didactic management of facemasks and gloves.

Furthermore, measurements from the Southern Hemisphere are largely absent. We undertook a pilot study to test four different deposition samplers and their efficacy in collecting microplastics: a bottle with a funnel attached, an open beaker, a petri dish covered in double-sided adhesive tape and an automatic wet deposition collector. The four samplers were deployed to a suburban site in Christchurch, New Zealand, for four 6-day sampling periods. It was originally hypothesised that the funnel would improve sample retention by limiting resuspension; however, the open beaker was found to be similarly effective. We were unable to assess the effectiveness of the automatic wet deposition collector robustly due to low rainfall during the sampling periods. The adhesive tape sampler proved impractical. Particles collected from all samplers were inspected and classified as microplastics according to a visual screening criteria. Fibres, films, fragments and beads were identified, with fibres being the dominant morphotype (90%); however, only 10% of suspected microplastics were confirmed as plastic following Î¼FTIR spectroscopy. Overall, we recommend the use of a funnel sampler or open beaker for future deposition studies. This is the first study of airborne microplastics in New Zealand and adds to a growing body of evidence as to the widespread nature of microplastics in the atmosphere.

The sampling consisted of 26 different fishmeal products, originating from 11 countries on four continents and Antarctica, and representing the vast majority of globally available and traded commercial products. A wide range of plastics content was found, ranging from 0 to 526.7 n kg-1, and a relatively higher plastics content was identified in fishmeal obtained from China (337.5Â±34.5 n kg-1) and Morocco (253.3Â±43.4 n kgâˆ’1), whereas no plastics was detected in krill meal obtained from Antarctica.

Sampling was part of the Blue Belt Programme, a marine survey of British Overseas Territories funded by the United Kingdom Government. Thirteen species of mesopelagic fishes identified from 30 specimens were compared with two species (two specimens) collected from rock pools or surface water near the shore. The digestive tracts of all fishes were examined for microplastics. Additionally, one specimen of Opostomias micripnus (GÃ¼nther, 1878) was analyzed after recovery from the stomach of a commercially fished species, Hyperoglyphe antarctica (Carmichael, 1819). One specimen of Anoplogaster cornuta was found to have ingested a bearded sea devil (Linophryne sp.), a cock-eyed squid (Histioteuthis sp.), a bolitaenid octopus, Japetella diaphana, remains of unidentifiable fish, crustaceans, and possibly salps. These prey items were also examined for microfibres. Both Histioteuthis sp. and Linophryne sp. had ingested fibers and these were considered â€œingested particlesâ€ for A. cornuta. Neither shallow water dwelling species had ingested microplastics, whilst 11 of the 13 studied mesopelagic species were found to be contaminated. Overall, 66.7% of mesopelagic fishes were found to contain microfibres. Anthropogenic fibers were common especially viscose, a semi-synthetic material which is associated with sanitary products as well as other items.

Plastics were introduced to the market in the 1950s and since then, global production figures and ocean plastic littering have increased exponentially. Of the 359 million tonnes (Mt) produced in 2018, an estimated 14.5 Mt has entered the ocean. In particular smaller plastic particles can be ingested by marine biota causing hazardous effects. Plastic marine debris (PMD) is exposed to physical, chemical and biological stressors. These cause macro and microplastic to break down into smaller fragments, including sub micrometre sized nanoplastic particles, which may account for an important but so far unevaluated fraction of the ocean plastic budget. Physicochemical and biological deterioration of PMD also leads to the release of more volatile compounds and the terminal oxidation of PMD, which most likely accounts for an important but also unevaluated fraction in the ocean plastic budget. This minireview provides an overview on (1) the quantity of plastic production and waste, pathways for plastics to enter the marine realm, the inventory of PMD and the negative effects of PMD to ocean life.

We applied this technique to select the top 300 active sites from the 10,000 surface sites of solvated gold (Au) nanoparticles. Â© 2020     The portfolio for energy and environmental sustainability demands development of new electrocatalysts with dramatically improved performance. This requires developing a deep understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying electrocatalysis processes to formulate in silico combinatorial calculations to identify the best possible new candidates for experimental synthesis and characterization. This needs the accuracy of full explicit solvent QM (limited to hundreds of atoms for 50 ps) but applied to complex reactions of real materials (grain boundaries, heterogeneous interfaces) including solvent, millions of atoms for nanoseconds. We report a hybrid computational framework including accurate polarization at the electrode-electrolyte interface that, combined with machine learning, can predict new, dramatically improved performance of realistic electrocatalysts, including solvent. This enables in silico design targeting dramatically improved performance along with other applications. Â© 2020     To develop new generations of electrocatalysts, we need the accuracy of full explicit solvent quantum mechanics (QM) for practical-sized nanoparticles and catalysts. To do this, we start with the RexPoN reactive force field that provides higher accuracy than density functional theory (DFT) for water and combine it with QM to accurately include long-range interactions and polarization effects to enable reactive simulations with QM accuracy in the presence of explicit solvent. We apply this RexPoN-embedded QM (ReQM) to reactive simulations of electrocatalysis, demonstrating that ReQM accurately replaces DFT water for computing the Raman frequencies of reaction intermediates during CO2 reduction to ethylene. Then, we illustrate the power of this approach by combining with machine learning to predict the performance of about 10,000 surface sites and identify the active sites of solvated gold (Au) nanoparticles and dealloyed Au surfaces. This provides an accurate but practical way to design high-performance electrocatalysts.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered important emitters of microparticles into aquatic systems. Among these microparticles are microplastics from, e.g., cosmetic products, and microfibers that are released during laundry of textiles made from synthetic fibers. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively and quantitatively characterize microplastic and microfiber contamination in effluents of the City of Saskatoon WWTP, Saskatchewan, Canada. The WWTP discharges directly into the South Saskatchewan River, which is an important water resource of central economic and environmental importance to the Canadian Prairies. To achieve this goal, a reference dataset was developed by determining Raman and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of neat plastic standards. Subsequently, samples were obtained from the final effluent of the Saskatoon WWTP during winter, spring, and summer 2019 by use of fine-meshed plankton nets. Microplastics and microfibers were extracted using Fenton oxidation and filtration, counted, and their identity determined by comparing Raman and FTIR spectra of individual microplastics and microfibers with the previously developed reference dataset. The number concentrations of both microplastics and microfibers were relatively stable across seasons, and fibers accounted for 82% of the total number of synthetic microparticles. Although the average total number concentration of microplastics and microfibers was only 1.76 per liter of effluent, at an average daily discharge of 80 million liters, this would amount to the emission of 141 million particles into the river per day. While the environmental relevance of these findings remains to be demonstrated, these results are an important first step toward understanding the magnitude of microplastic contamination in the Canadian Prairies.

Gulf of Mannar (GoM) and Palk Bay (PB) are two important biodiversity hotspots along the south-east coast of India. However, in the recent years the intense tourism and fishery activities have made the ecosystem and biota of these two ecologically significant coastal zones vulnerable to microplastic contamination. Hence, a comparative study on the seasonal distribution of microplastics in the surface waters, sediments, and in commercially important fishes were conducted to evaluate the threats imposed by microplastics on the environment and biota of both these coastal ecosystems. Microplastic distribution in the surface waters and sediments of GoM and PB exhibited conspicuous seasonal variation and showed positive correlation with the seasonal current patterns. In the surface waters of GoM, microplastics were abundant during the South West Monsoon whereas in PB it was high during the Early Winter Monsoon period. In the sediments of PB, microplastics was more during Spring Inter-monsoonand South West Monsoon whereas in GoM it was high during Late Winter Monsoon. Fragments, of size 1 to 5 mm formed the abundant microplastic type in the surface waters whereas in the sediments, fragments of size < 1 mm dominated. Of the gut content of the 613 fishes belonging to 12 families examined, microplastics were more in pelagic than demersal fishes with higher incidences in the family Clupeidae (42%). Among the fishes studied, microplastic ingestion was more in Selaroides leptolepis (27.77%), Sphyraena sp. (14.28%), Pelates quadrilineatus (12%), Caranx sp. (10.34%), and Sphyraena barracuda (10%).

Nevertheless, the change in toxicity caused by pollutant adsorption on nanoplastics is still controversial, depending on the interactions between chemical and physical pollutants, the consequent change in bioavailability, the modification of intake, transport and accumulation in the organisms and also on the characteristics of contaminants. In this context, the aim of the present study was the evaluation of combined effects made by 0.5 Î¼m nanobeads of polystyrene and triclosan adsorbed on their surface in comparison with those caused by single contaminants. The systemic effects of 7 day exposure to nanoplastics, triclosan alone and to the nanoplastic-triclosan complex have been analyzed by employing zebrafish larvae and using a multi-tier approach from the evaluation of cellular and molecular effects to the impact at organism level. Results highlighted by confocal microscopy evidenced nanobead ingestion and translocation in several tissues and organs to guarantee the goodness of the exposure results. Behavioral assays were then conducted to highlight larval swimming defects as a â€˜real-timeâ€™ readout of the potential effects on the whole organism, while a suite of several biomarkers and functional proteomics was applied to investigate the effects at both cellular and molecular levels. The whole data set pointed out a clear modification in the toxicological effects of the nanoplastic-triclosan complex in comparison with single contaminants, proved by opposite behaviours in the larval swimming activity and modulation of diverse protein classes as well as by different effects on several biochemical endpoints. This means that the interaction between chemical and physical pollutants leads to more complicated responses than additive, synergistic or antagonist models, resulting in a modification of toxicity instead of its increase or decrease.

And the distribution of the microplastics is extremely imbalanced around the global waters. In the present review, we have summarized the development of aquaculture in the World and China based on the existing data sources. And the total aquaculture production of the World will over 90Â million tonnes, which will exceed the capture production in 2020. Aquaculture products will become one of the most important sources of high-quality protein.

This represents an additional 3.5 million adults screened for colorectal cancer. This is a severe concern of this research, and an at-tempt was made to prepare a target-specific formulation that could circumvent chemotherapy-relat-ed compilation and improvise higher cellular uptake. The fundamental agenda of this research was to prepare and develop Anti-EGFR mAb and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) fabricated polymeric nanoparti-cles for colorectal cancer. Objective: The main objective of this research was to prepare and evaluate more target specific formulation for the treatment of colorectal cancer. PLGA and PEG-based polymeric nanoparticles are capable of preventing opsonization via the reticuloendothelial system. Hence, prepared polymeric nanoparticles are capable of higher cellular uptake. Methods: The Poly(d,1-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) were combined utilizing the ring-opening polymerization method. The presence of PEG prevents opsoniza-tion and distinguished blood concentration along with enhanced targeting. The presence of PLGA benefits in the sustained release of polymeric formulations. The optimized formulation (5-FU-PL-GA-PEG-NP) was lyophilized using 4% trehalose (cryoprotectants) and conjugated with An-ti-EGFR mAb on its surface to produce Anti-EGFR-5-FU-PLGA-PEG-NP; the final formulation, which increases target specificity and drug delivery system of nanoparticles. Results: The spherical shaped optimized formulation, 5-FU-PLGA-PEG-NP-3 was found to have higher percentage drug entrapment efficacy (71.23%), higher percentage drug content (1.98 Â± 0.34%) with minimum particles size (252.3nm) and anionic zeta potential (-31.23mV). The IC50 value of Anti-EGFR-5-FU-PLGA-PEG-NP was 1.01 Âµg/mL after 48 hours incubation period in the HCT 116 cell line, indicating higher anticancer effects of the final formulation. Conclusion: From the outcomes of various experiments, it was concluded that Anti-EGFR-5-FU-PLGA-PEG-NP has biphasic drug release kinetics, higher cellular uptake and higher cytotoxicity. Therefore, Anti-EGFR-5-FU-PLGA-PEG-NP holds excellent potential for drug delivery to EGFR positive colorectal cancer cells.

TWP was generated on the roads and migrated to the environment matrix by runoff. It was detected in several environment media such as pavement, soil, water, sediment and organisms. The selection of markers was important because the determination of TWP was mainly achieved by detecting markers. The pollution of TWP was caused by adsorption and leaching of contaminants, which pose certain risk to human and organism. The direct ways to control TWP were intercept the particles during migration and accelerate the decomposition of TWP in the environment. Improved tire formulation could decrease the wear rate and reduce the emission of tire particles. At present, there are many study gaps such as TWP properties, detection methods, environmental fate and so on, which hampers assessing the risk of TWP in the environment.

In recent years, proteomics has emerged as a powerful tool for searching protein biomarkers in the field of pollution biomonitoring. For biomonitoring marine contamination, there is a consensus that bivalves are preferred organisms to assess organic and inorganic pollutants. Thus, the bivalve proteome was intensively studied, particularly the mussel. It is well documented that heavy metal pollution and organic chemicals altered the structural proteins causing degradation of tissues of molluscs. Also, it is well known that proteins involved in stress oxidative such as glutathione and enzymes as catalase, superoxide dismutase or peroxisomes are overexpressed in response to contaminants. Additionally, using bivalves, other groups of proteins proposed as pollution biomarkers are the metabolic proteins. Even though other marine species are used to monitor the pollution, the presence of proteomic tools in these studies is scarce. Concerning freshwater pollution field, a great variety of animal species (fish and crustaceans) are used as biomonitors in proteomics studies compared to plants that are scarcely analysed. In fish species, proteins involved in stress oxidative such as heat shock family or proteins from lipid and carbohydrate metabolism were proposed as candidate biomarkers. On the contrary, for crustaceans there is a lack of proteomic studies individually assessing the contaminants. Novel scenarios, including emerging contaminants and new threats, will require proteomic technology for a systematic search of protein biomarkers and a greater knowledge at molecular level of those cellular pathways induced by contamination.

By 2050, the world might have plastics in the oceans much more than fish. Therefore, it is threatening the world's environment, economy and human health. Based on latest global statistics, most common plastic waste is either landfilled, recycled or incinerated. Recycling is the least implemented method. Degradation of manufactured plastics can take between 100 to 600 years. They get fragmented in the terrestrial and aquatic environments into little particles called microplastics, which may end in human body through food chain, derma products and drinking bottled water. This research paper highlighted some global facts and challenges of plastic waste management, to end with best proposed solutions to the world's governments. 143 resources have been reviewed, 90 of which, included articles, books, and some international organizations websites were selected to cover the introduction, results and discussion parts. The research found out that plastic waste management is the responsibility of both, global governments, and individuals. Most parts of the world lack laws that address plastic waste in particular, not as all waste. Moreover, laws have to be strictly enforced in countries where they are being violated.

Billions of tons of plastic waste that is generated gets accumulated as plastic debris in soil, sediments, oceans and surface water with no obvious strategy to tackle them. The plastics disposed in the water and land ultimately disintegrate to microplastics, widely accepted as particles <5 mm size. These microplastics are ubiquitous contaminants prevalent in the environment and pose great ecological hazard. Ensuring sustainability of coastal marine areas worldwide and reducing biodiversity loss has long been identified as a global challenge. However, dearth of scientific strategies and standardized protocols for fast and accurate detection of microplastics is a matter of concern and needs immediate attention. Therefore, robust, reliable and high through-put detection method for microplastics in oceanic environment is highly sought after. Quite a few studies have explored the potential of Nile red a solvatochromic dye in detection of microplastics. However, often Nile red alone cannot be used in quantifying microplastic due to false positives generated by staining of organic matter. In this work, we have adopted a method based on costaining of microplastics using Nile red dye and Methylene blue by fluorescence microscopy. We have observed that Nile red overestimated microplastic particles and this study serves as foundation to our future work.

In this research, a robust and environmentally friendly fabrication approach to produce films reinforced with only parts-per-million (ppm) octamethyl-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (mePOSS) using conventional extrusion and blow molding processing is demonstrated. The nanocomposites exhibit enhanced thermomechanical properties, and only 160 ppm mePOSS increase the tensile mechanical modulus, E, by â‰ˆ120% relative to the neat polymer. Remarkably, there is no penalty on strain at fracture Îµf, as usually seen in reinforced (nano) composites. Toughness, yield stress, tear, and puncture resistance are also an increasing function of mePOSS content. Furthermore, mePOSS also increase the thermal decomposition temperature and melting temperature. The placement of mePOSS in the molecular web is key to the thermal and mechanical reinforcement and these properties maximize when the nanoparticle size ã€ˆDã€‰ matches the tube diameter dt, i.e., ã€ˆDã€‰/dtÂ â‰ˆ 1. This simple fabrication approach combined with ppm POSS content and tunability of physical properties afforded by the location of POSS in the entangled web offers a new paradigm for the bottom-up design of tunable lightweight polymer nanocomposites with superior thermomechanical and transport properties.

The synthesized carbon supported MgO nanoparticles (hereafter referred to as CSMO) were dispersed in high density polyethylene (HDPE) polymer to satisfy several requirements for EV battery packs. The loading amount of MgO was achieved up to 22 wt % of carbon, and the size distribution was in the range of 50 to 100 nm. The hybrid nanocomposites were characterized by water-vapor transmission rate (WVTR), various spectroscopic methods, thermo-gravimetric analysis and elemental analysis. Mechanical properties were also tested. The extremely low WVTR value of CSMO/HDPE composites below 0.5 mgmâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1 is the lowest value among any other gas barrier films reported in the literature.

Nanoplastics (<1000 nm) could pose a real and uncontrolled ecological challenge due to their smaller size and sharp ability to penetrate living organisms at any trophic level. Few studies evaluate the impact of nanoplastics in vivo on the immune system of aquatic organisms, while most of them assessed the impact on indirect markers of immune response such as regulation of gene expression, ROS production or DNA genotoxicity, among others. Moreover, the study of the effects of nanoplastics on aquatic vertebrate species in vivo is still scarce. In this context, we seek to shed light on the underlying effects of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) on the immune response in a model fish species (Danio rerio, zebrafish) after an acute exposure, with a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our results show that PS-NPs (65 nm) are efficiently taken up by zebrafish liver cells, accumulating mainly in lysosomes. Furthermore, the expression of immune genes presents a synergy when cells were simultaneously exposed to PS-NPs, at a low dose and early time point (12 h) and challenged with a viral stimulus (poly(I:C)). Moreover, zebrafish larvae also internalize PS-NPs, accumulating them in the gut and pancreas. However, at concentrations of up to 50 mg l-1 in an acute exposure (48 h), PS-NPs do not interfere with the survival of the larvae after a lethal bacterial challenge (Aeromonas hydrophila). This study addresses the relevant environmental question of whether a living organism exposed to PS-NPs can cope with a real immune threat. We show that, although PS-NPs can induce an immune response, the survival of zebrafish larvae challenged with a bacterial infection after an acute exposure to PS-NP is not decimated with respect to unexposed larvae.

The objective of this paper is to review microplastics and analyze its possible impact on wildlife and seabird. Seabirds are upper-trophic level predators in marine ecosystems, feed on zooplankton, fish, and squid. Microplastics in seabirds have been reported in many countries, including the USA, Canada, Brazil, Japan, China, the Netherlands, and North Pacific region, involving albatrosses, petrels, storm-petrels, fulmars, cormorants, shearwaters, penguins, and many other seabird species. Microplastics were accidentally ingested because of their resemblance to the fish, plankton, or from ingestion of microplastics that already occurred inside fish food. Types of microplastics were pellet, fragment, film, fiber, foamed plastic and styrofoam. Microplastics might decrease feeding stimuli by producing a false sense of fullness, causing the bird to stop eating, resulting in malnutrition and death. Other harmful impact on birds are interrupting nutrient absorption, disrupting reproductive problems, and hindered growth and survival of chicks.

We evaluated a modular procedure to label liposomal nanoparticles with the radioisotope zirconium-89 (89Zr).

Vascular permeability was assessed in vivo using three-dimensional dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (3D DCE-MRI) and ex vivo using near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging. The 89Zr-radiolabeled liposomes displayed a biodistribution pattern typical of long-circulating nanoparticles. Importantly, they markedly accumulated in atherosclerotic lesions in the abdominal aorta, as evident on PET/MRI and confirmed by autoradiography, and this uptake moderately correlated with vascular permeability.

Optical and fluorescence microscopy were used to enumerate microplastic fiber and fragment concentrations, with melting point analysis applied for confirmation, in water sieved (sized 43â€“104 Î¼m) from the upper meter of the water column at positions across tidal fronts. The Cooper River front contained significantly higher microplastic water concentrations, dominated by fragments, on the riverside and within the frontal zone versus the seaward side, indicating an input of microplastic from land-based sources. No significant increase in abundance of zooplankton was found within the Cooper River or Ashley River fronts. Microplastic in the gut of field-collected zooplankton was observed using fluorescence microscopy. Only zooplankton from the Cooper River were observed with ingested microplastic. Absence of detection in zooplankton from the Ashley River may be due to fibers being more prevalent than fragments in surface waters at that front. On average, 1% of the filter-feeding zooplankton observed contained ingested microplastic particles suggesting zooplankton may be selectively feeding.

Plastic waste in the environment is subject to a number of physi-cochemical interactions and biodegradation in which bacteria are involved. By using synthetic waste, they reduce the size of plastic garbage while increasing its dispersion in the environment. Small plastic particles, invisible to the naked eye, are called nanoplastic. Nanoplastic is not inert to living organisms. Due to its size, it is taken up with food by animals and passed on in the trophic chain. The ability to penetrate the bodyâ€™s barriers through nanoplastic leads to the induction of biological effects with various outcomes.

Then to investigate the quality of packed fillets, samples were taken in days 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25, and were evaluated using chemical (pH, PV, TBA, TVB-N), microbial (TVC, PTC, LAB, EBC and H2S producing bacteria) and sensory tests. Based on the results, significant differences (p&lt;0.05) were observed between control and experimental treatments in different days. The sensory attributes of rainbow trout fillets correlated well with the microbiological analyses (r=0.91). With regards to sensory scores and the microbiological analysis, the shelf-life of rainbow trout fillets has been determined in the control and experimental treatments, 13 to 15 and 18 to 20 days, respectively.

This paper assessed the ecological impact of plastics that are less than 5Â mm on the longest dimension, hereinafter called microplastics. Sixty (60) residents were purposively sampled using a snow-balling approach for the study. Questionnaires, field observations of microplastics and sources, fish, and water sediments from the River were the data for the study. Data was analysed with SPSS version 20.0 and presented in tables and figures. Laboratory analysis of microplastics was run on sediments trawled, and on the digestive tracts and gills of fishes caught, all from the River, to assess the accumulation of microplastics. The study revealed that microplastics are present in the River and there is uptake of microplastics by some resident aquatic life which may pose threat to lives. The study further revealed positive correlations between number of fishes and microplastics loads in fish and between microplastic loads in water and loads in fish. Residents are aware of microplastics in the catchment area of the River. The unregulated gutters that flow directly into the River are the main sources. Wind and running water were discovered as the potential ways by which microplastics are deposited into the River. It is therefore recommended that wastewater be treated before reaching the River and gutters should be channelled out of the River where necessary and plastics usage should be regulated and if possible, banned.

Microplastic from land-based source can enter the ocean through estuarine waters. Makassar City with a population around 1.7 million people, provides possible sources of microplastic pollution in Makassar Strait through the flow of surrounding rivers, Tallo and Jeneberang in particular. Neuston net method was used to collect 18 surface-water samples from Makassar Estuaries for microplastic analysis. Fish gastrointestinal tracts were collected from 76 pelagic fish in study sites for microplastic analysis, using KOH digestive method. Surface-water samples from both Jeneberang and Tallo river estuaries positively contained microplastic (MPs) particles with abundance of 1.84Â±0.17 and 1.78Â±0.25 MPs m-3 respectively. There is no difference between microplastic abundance on both estuaries using t-test statistic, but microplastic from both estuaries, in general, has different characteristics in shape and color. The higher abundance of microplastic in riverine part on both estuaries indicated that microplastic originated from land sources. Pelagic fish from both estuaries were also contained an average of 0.91 to 3.5 MPs individual-1 with more than 50% of contamination level on most species. This result shows that estuary water in Makassar City have been contaminated by microplastic particles and have accumulated to pelagic fish as consumption fish, posing a threat to food safety and human health.

Mostly plastics used in packaging of beverages, fresh meats, fruits and vegetables are under concern today. Single-use packages result in generation of several billion tons of garbage till date, which pollutes the environment. At the immediate past, it has come to light that micro plastics obtained due to slow degradation of SUP present in oceans, are also being consumed by marine organisms such as fishes and shellfish species which disturbs the marine life extensively. Hence, finding right strategy to mitigate the plastic waste related issues has becoming inevitable today.

The results showed that the digestive efficiencies (%) were followed as the order: 10%KOH &gt; RIPA tissue lysate + Proteinase K &gt; Proteinase K &gt; 30%H2O2. In addition, PA particle quality increased after treatments, and PU particle colour slight changed after H2O2 treatment. Interestingly, the biodegradable plastic particles were soluble in 10% KOH completely. As expected, the infrared spectrum and Raman spectrum of plastic particles did not change before and after treatments, and the plastic particles could be identified based on their spectrum, except for the biodegradable plastic. As a conclusion, the treatment method of 10% KOH at 50â„ƒ and 180r/min incubated for 6hours will be recommended as the preferred method for microplastic isolation from biological tissues.

After surface modification, the C-dots decreased in size from 6â€“25 to 3â€“20 nm without changing their morphology. The modified C-dots were fluorescent, and the fluorescence peak gradually shifted to a longer excitation wavelength (from 420 to 500). Upon modification, thereby elucidating a competitive quantum yield of 15% (C-dots-PEG1500N) and 12.6% (C-dots-BPEI). The UV-visible spectrum of the C-dots modified with PEG1500N contained an absorption peak at 290 nm, whereas, that of the C-dots modified with BPEI contained peak at 360. Fourier-transform infrared analysis showed a peak at 1700 cmâˆ’1 (C-dots-PEG1500N) and 1697 cmâˆ’1 (C-dots-BPEI) that corresponds to the amide ([sbnd]HCONH[sbnd]) carbonyl bond, indicating that PEG1500N and BPEI had been successfully passivated on the surface of C-dots. To examine photothermal response, irradiation was carried out for 5 min using three different instruments which is UV-lamp (365 nm), visible lamp and laser (532 nm, 1 W/cm2) where temperature for each sample increased respectively. C-dots demonstrated not losing their luminescent properties upon irradiation to UV-lamp and laser for 30 min. Contrary, the intensity of fluorescence reduced when it exposed to the visible lamp for the same period. In vitro studies of the modified C-dots with zebrafish (Danio rerio) revealed that C-dots-PEG1500N is non-toxic while C-dots-BPEI is highly toxic to the fish embryos. Significantly, this study has successfully demonstrated that Gadong tuber starch can be used as a starch-based modifier for C-dots; which possibly can be utilized as a nanocarrier with thermal sensing properties.

Despite the lack of recycling and the presence of severe plastic pollution in many African countries, MPs have been scarcely reported in African freshwaters and the current study gives the first empirical account for West Africa. The study investigates MP pollution in an important West African river system (Osun River system, Nigeria) and gives an insight into microplastic contamination in a main European river (Rhine River), using gastropods which are potential consumers of MPs, from both systems. From the Osun River system, the most common gastropods (Lanistes varicus and Melanoides tuberculata) were analysed for MP contamination. Two MP types (fibre and film) were recorded in L. varicus, whereas only fibre was recorded in M. tuberculata. Micro-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (Î¼FTIR) revealed that the MP films in the African gastropods were made of polyethylene and strongly resembled black polyethylene bags that covered the Osun River banks. From the Rhine River, the gastropod Theodoxus fluviatilis was analysed and nylon as well as polypropylene fibres were found. In both systems (Osun River and Rhine River), fibre was the dominant MP type. In conclusion, the study shows that MP contamination in Nigeria, a West African country with a lack of recycling and poor waste management practice, is reflected in two different local gastropod species. Furthermore, the comparison with a European gastropod species shows that fibres are the dominant MP type in gastropods from both freshwater systems. In both systems, MPs ingested by the gastropods could be transferred to higher trophic levels following predation. We therefore recommend that more empirical studies should be carried out along different feeding guilds of African freshwater invertebrates and fish. When MPs are transferred to fish, MPs may reach humans through fish consumption.

The encapsulation efficiency for CU in the lipid nanocarriers was found to be higher as compared to that reported for polymer-based carriers. The cytotoxicity of the blank and antioxidant-loaded nanocarriers was negligible at lipid concentrations 300 and 500 nM. Morphological changes were observed for neuronally derived human SH-SY5Y cells subjected to damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Using flow cytometry, we quantified the effects of CU and FO, co-encapsulated in spongosome and cubosome lipid NPs on the response of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells to H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress. Measurements of the intracellular ROS levels (using a 2â€²,7â€²-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate probe) and of apoptotic cells (using an Annexin V-PE/SYTOX-green assay) were performed to compare the neuroprotective potential of the liquid crystalline spongosome and cubosome nanocarriers to that of ethanolic solutions or aqueous suspensions of the CU/FO mixtures.

This review discusses the sources, types and distributions of microplastic in marine environment stress that there are plastic particles floating on coastal and marine environment in the world, while in China, coastal areas are the main polluted areas. Microplastic particles threat various marine organisms including fish. The main pathway that marine fish accumulate microplastic is ingestion by mistake. Plastic particles are mainly found in the digestive tract of several fish species. The ecotoxicological effects of microplastic on fish include:decrease survival, affect development and reproduction, disturb behavior, lead to tissue lesion and inflammatory reaction, cause metabolic disorder, damage nervous system, induce oxidative stress and interrupt endocrine. In the future, several aspects need to take more attentions on the effects of microplastic research, especially the difference between microplastic used in laboratory experiment and natural environment, such as concentrations, shape and size. Furthermore, international cooperation should be strengthened for observing the migration and transformation pathway of microplastic in marine ecosystem as well as investigating the ecological effects of microplastic and their internal mechanisms on marine organisms and ecosystem. Meanwhile, the joint toxicity of microplastic with other marine pollutants should be valued and its interactive effects with global climate change, such as high tempeture, ocean acidification and hypoxia should be further investigated.

Here, we report a seawater-induced strategy to create in situ an underwater superoleophobic surface, starting from the coatings of a self-polishing polymer and seawater-responsive polymer-grafted SiO 2 nanoparticles. The coatings' surfaces were able to renew in artificial seawater through the hydrolysis of the superficial self-polishing polymer and its subsequent dissolution. Particularly, the grafted poly(triisopropylsilyl acrylate-co-3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane) chains could transform into hydrophilic ones via seawater-induced hydrolysis, which additionally strengthened the oil-repellency (zero oil adhesive force) and endowed the surface with excellent antiprotein adsorption characteristics. Because the hydrolysis was limited to the superficial layer of the coatings, it could avoid the water-swelling that instead occurs with conventional underwater superoleophobic coatings, with significant benefits to its durability. We believe that the seawater-induced renewal of underwater superoleophobic surfaces will be useful in extreme marine environments.

Microplastics of less than 1 mm obtained from different organisms were in the range of 43% to 78%. Rayon (a semi-synthetic polymer) was the most predominant polymer type of microplastics found, accounting for 48.92%. The demersal fish contained relatively more rayon compared with the pelagic fish samples. Surface chemical components of the microplastics were altered possibly owing to the abiotic oxidation. Large variations of the weathering morphologies were observed in the surface of the differently shaped microplastics originating from the organisms. Some microplastics exhibited a rough surface, broken margins, and pronounced pores. SEM-EDS, as an auxiliary technology, would provide a way for data calibration in microplastics investigation. The combination method can provide complementary data and therefore can be successfully applied to accurately identify microplastics.

Despite a huge scale of the problem, almost nothing is known about pathways and mechanisms of involvement of micro-and nanoplastics in marine food webs, trophic processes, global biogeochemical cycles. In this study, a hypothesis is considered and experimentally verified about the role exopolymers from marine phytoplankton play in flocculating micro-and nanoplastics and forming their aggregates in marine environments to transfer and deposit them further in bottom sediments. In experiments with non-axenic cultures of the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina (RHO) and the green alga Tetraselmis suecica (TET) exposed to micro-polystyrene particles (MP, 4.3 Î¼m diam., about 0.4 Ã— 106 particles/ml, 16 mg/L), microalgal exudates were shown to promote MP flocculation and immobilization on vertical glass surfaces. The highest levels of MP were ""cleared"" from the medium by the TET culture which released more extracellular polysacharides. Hetero-aggregation of MP and algal cells was not observed, probably owing to turbulent mixing and cell motility. Abundant bacterial consortia relealed in the cultures (up to 9 Ã— 106 cells ml-1) could be an additional source of exopolymers and serve an agent of MP flocculation and adhesion. Thus, the results obtained highlight the potential for phytoplankton exudates to interact with micro-and nanoplastics, and potentially affect their bioavailability and vertical transport in marine environments.

The ecological effects of microplastics on the marine environment are poorly understood, with even less attention to freshwater systems. To assess whether microplastics have infiltrated food webs of shallow nearshore ecosystems of the St. Lawrence River, we sampled four sites along the international section of the St. Lawrence River, from Alexandria Bay to Waddington, NY.

Sediment subsamples at two of four sediment sampling sites contained plastic micro-particles. No microbeads were detected within any of the Dreissenid mussels or anuran digestive tract samples. The Dreissenids were likely too small to ingest microbeads greater than 35 microns.

Local therapy with enema formulations, such as micronized budesonide (EntocortÂ®), is a common strategy for treating patients with distally active IBD. However, we hypothesize that micronized particulates are too large to effectively penetrate colorectal mucus, limiting the extent of drug delivery to affected tissues prior to clearance. Here, we describe the development of a budesonide nanosuspension (NS) with the appropriate surface coating and size to enhance penetration of colorectal mucus and ulcerated colorectal tissues. We demonstrate that model fluorescent polystyrene (PS) particles âˆ¼200 nm in size with a muco-inert Pluronic F127 coating provide enhanced mucosal distribution and tissue penetration in mice with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBD compared to model 2 Î¼m PS particles coated with polyvinylpyrollidone (PVP), the stabilizer used in the clinical micronized budesonide formulation. We then used a wet-milling process to develop a budesonide NS formulation with a muco-inert Pluronic F127 coating (particle size âˆ¼230 nm), as well as a budesonide microsuspension (MS) stabilized with PVP (particle size âˆ¼2 Î¼m). Using an acute TNBS mouse model of IBD, we show that daily budesonide NS enema treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the macroscopic (decreased colon weight) and microscopic (histology score) symptoms of IBD compared to untreated controls or mice treated daily with the budesonide MS enema. Further, we show that the budesonide NS enema treated mice had a significantly reduced number of inflammatory macrophages and IL-Î² producing CD11b + cells in colon tissue compared to untreated controls or mice treated with the budesonide MS enema. We conclude that the nano-size and muco-inert coating allowed for enhanced local delivery of budesonide, and thus, a more significant impact on local colorectal tissue inflammation.

In the Arctic, currents may play a dominant role in recent mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet, bringing warmer water into contact with marine terminating glaciers. Limited observational evidence suggests that the salinity in fjords around Greenland has decreased. However, understanding the impacts of freshening is complicated by the complex impacts of the meltwater on ocean currents, as the meltwater can change the density and the stratification at both local (i.e., within a given fjord) and regional scales (i.e., in the Greenland and Labrador Seas). There is a critical need to understand these changes as they can impact marine ecosystems and the global thermohaline circulation.

Besides a regular standard procedure to assess toxicity, and considering the mode of action of nGO-PEG in cancer treatment, a simultaneous infrared lamp exposure was carried out for D. magna and D. rerio. Additionally, and taking advantage of the phenotypic transparency of D. magna, nGO-PEG was fluorescently tagged to evaluate the potential uptake of nGO-PEG. The R. subcapitata growth inhibition test showed effects during the first 48 h, recovering till the end of the test (96 h). No acute or chronic effects were observed for D. magna, under standard or infrared light exposures although confocal microscope images showed nGO-PEG uptake. Very small percentages of mortality and abnormalities were observed in D. rerio exposed with and without the infrared lamp. Although low hazard may be expected for nGO-PEG in aquatic ecosystems, further studies with species with different life traits should be accomplished, in order to derive more accurate conclusions.

We found in both the aposymbiotic sea-anemone Aiptasia sp. and the coral Favites chinensis that the infectivity of symbiotic algae into the host is severely suppressed by microspheres fed either directly or indirectly through microsphere-fed Artemia sp. Similar trends were seen when microplastics collected from commercial facewash were used instead of microspheres.

Green polymers are clearly tendency subdivision of this stream and numerous bio-sourced plastics have been developed. Recent research has further focused on the development of new bio-based materials such as edible/biodegradable films for food products. Scope and approach: Fish gelatin (FG), a protein with recreatable reserve, biodegradability, and processability, has a remarkable potential in bio-packaging. However, there have been noticeable issues concerning the use of FG as packing material, including its low mechanical strength, poor moisture stability, and poor water barrier properties. This paper aims to review the state-of-the-art in development of FG-based films and highlights how they play a crucial role in modifying the properties of such films. Various types of nanofillers that have been included into FG to fabricate bio-nanocomposite films, such as nanoclays (montmorillonite, sepiolite), polysaccharide nanofillers (nanowhiskers/nanofibers), metal ions (silver, copper) and metal oxides nanoparticles (ZnO, TiO2) are reviewed. Key findings and conclusions: Cross-linking is a promising technique to improve the performance and applicability of FG-based biomaterials, particularly respecting their water sensitivity, which hinders many of their potential uses as food contact materials. Bio-nanocomposite technology may help to make high-performance materials with extra bio-functional properties, and it is anticipated to be a dynamic research in the future. In general, more research is required to ameliorate application processes of FG films, especially physical aspects, to be suitable for bio-packaging application.

Over the past decade numerous studies have documented microplastic ingestion by marine species with more recent investigations focussing on the secondary impacts of microplastic ingestion on ecosystem processes. However, few studies so far have examined microplastic ingestion by mesopelagic fish which are one of the most abundant pelagic groups in our oceans and through their vertical migrations are known to contribute significantly to the rapid transport of carbon and nutrients to the deep sea. Therefore, any ingestion of microplastics by mesopelagic fish may adversely affect this cycling and may aid in transport of microplastics from surface waters to the deep-sea benthos. In this study microplastics were extracted from mesopelagic fish under forensic conditions and analysed for polymer type utilising micro-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (micro-FTIR) analysis. Fish specimens were collected from depth (300-600 m) in a warm-core eddy located in the Northwest Atlantic, 1,200 km due west of Newfoundland during April and May 2015. In total, 233 fish gut contents from seven different species of mesopelagic fish were examined. An alkaline dissolution of organic materials from extracted stomach contents was performed and the solution filtered over a 0.7 Î¼m borosilicate filter. Filters were examined for microplastics and a subsample originating from 35 fish was further analysed for polymer type through micro-FTIR analysis. Seventy-three percent of all fish contained plastics in their gut contents with Gonostoma denudatum having the highest ingestion rate (100%) followed by Serrivomer beanii (93%) and Lampanyctus macdonaldi (75%). Overall, we found a much higher occurrence of microplastic fragments, mainly polyethylene fibres, in the gut contents of mesopelagic fish than previously reported. Stomach fullness, species and the depth at which fish were caught at, were found to have no effect on the amount of microplastics found in the gut contents. However, these plastics were similar to those sampled from the surface water. Additionally, using forensic techniques we were able to highlight that fibres are a real concern rather than an artefact of airborne contamination.

The grains of plate pearlite, ferriteâ€“carbide mixture, and structure-free ferrite are analyzed. The carbide phase in the surface layers of the steel changes in two mutually complementary processes during rail operation: (1) cleavage of cementite particles with subsequent entrainment in ferrite grains or plates (in the pearlite structure); (2) cleavage and dissolution of cementite particles, with transfer of carbon atoms to dislocations (in Cottrell atmospheres and in dislocational cores), which transport them to the ferrite grains (or plates), where cementite nanoparticles are formed again. In the previous location of the plates, fragmented dislocational substructure appears. The boundaries of the fragments are found at the positions previously occupied by cementite Î±-phase boundaries. The solution of cementite is mainly due to the energy of carbon atoms at dislocation cores and subboundaries in comparison with the cementite lattice. The binding energy of the carbon atom and the dislocations is 0.6 eV and the binding energy of the carbon atom and the subboundary is 0.8 eV, as against 0.4 eV for the carbon atom in cementite. Elastoplastic stress fields are formed; their stress concentrators are intra- and interphase boundaries of ferrite and pearlite grains, cementite plates and ferrite of the pearlite colonies, and globular cementite and ferrite particles. Those are also the basic sources of curvature and torsion in the crystal lattice of the rail steel. On approaching the contact surface, the number of stress concentrators increases, and the internal long-range stress fields are of greater amplitude.

Objectives: The objective of this article was to describe a novel curcumin containing a nanomicelle formulation using a polyvinyl caprolactamâ€“polyvinyl acetateâ€“polyethylene glycol (PVCLâ€“PVAâ€“PEG) graft copolymer. Methods: Nanomicelle curcumin was formulated and optimized and then further evaluated for in vitro cytotoxicity/in vivo ocular irritation, in vitro cellular uptake/in vivo corneal permeation, and in vitro antioxidant activity/in vivo anti-inflammatory efficacy. Results: The solubility, chemical stability, and antioxidant activity were greatly improved after the encapsulation of the PVCLâ€“PVAâ€“PEG nanomicelles. The nanomicelle curcumin ophthalmic solution was simple to prepare and the nanomicelles are stable to the storage conditions, and it had good cellular tolerance. Nanomicelle curcumin also had excellent ocular tolerance in rabbits. The use of nanomicelles significantly improved in vitro cellular uptake and in vivo corneal permeation as well as improved anti-inflammatory efficacy when compared with a free curcumin solution. Conclusions: These findings indicate that nanomicelles could be promising topical delivery systems for the ocular administration of curcumin.

By 2015, global production had increased to 322 million metric tons (Mt) year-1, which approaches the total weight of the human population produced in plastic every year. Approximately half is used for packaging and other disposables, 40% of plastic waste is not accounted for in managed landfills or recycling facilities, and 4.8-12.7 Mt year-1 enter the ocean as macroscopic litter and microplastic particles. Here, we argue that such mismanaged plastic waste is similar to other persistent pollutants, such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which once threatened a ""silent spring"" on land. Such a scenario seems now possible in the ocean, where plastic cannot be easily removed, accumulates in organisms and sediments, and persists much longer than on land. New evidence indicates a complex toxicology of plastic micro- and nanoparticles on marine life, and transfer up the food chain, including to people. We detail solutions to the current crisis of accumulating plastic pollution, suggesting a Global Convention on Plastic Pollution that incentivizes collaboration between governments, producers, scientists, and citizens.

However, public concerns regarding the well-being of human may hinder the wide utilization of this promising innovation. Although, humans are exposed to airborne nanosized particles from an early age, exposure to such particles has risen dramatically within the last century due to anthropogenic sources of nanoparticles. The wide application of nanomaterials in industry, consumer products, and medicine has raised concerns regarding the potential toxicity of nanoparticles in humans. In this review, the effects of nanomaterials on the reproductive system in animal models are discussed. Females are particularly more vulnerable to nanoparticle toxicity, and toxicity in this population may affect reproductivity and fetal development. Moreover, various types of nanoparticles have negative impacts on male germ cells, fetal development, and the female reproductive system. These impacts are associated with nanoparticle modification, composition, concentration, route of administration, and the species of the animal. Therefore, understanding the impacts of nanoparticles on animal growth and reproduction is essential. Many studies have examined the effects of nanoparticles on primary and secondary target organs, with a concentration on the in vivo and in vitro effects of nanoparticles on the male and female reproductive systems at the clinical, cellular, and molecular levels. This review provides important information regarding organism safety and the potential hazards of nanoparticle use and supports the application of nanotechnologies by minimizing the adverse effects of nanoparticles in vulnerable populations.

One interesting phenomenon is their collective behaviour actuated by dynamic fields, which is yet to be adequately studied. Herein, we report a novel method of using millions of magnetic nanoparticles to generate a dynamic-equilibrium particle-based vortex, which can manipulate multiple cargos simultaneously at the microscale. The governing physical laws of the generation of a particle-based vortex are explained and the experimental results are presented. The high effectiveness of this micro-vortex-based method of particle gathering is testified. Moreover, the vortex can be navigated near a solid surface in a controlled manner. The velocity and morphology of the mobile vortices with different pitch angles are investigated, showing that the vortex moving with small pitch angles is capable of maintaining the original shape and coverage area. Collecting and transporting multiple polystyrene (PS) microbeads into a channel using the vortex are also demonstrated. This method allows us to perform micromanipulation using the collective behaviour of nanoparticles and to develop new strategies for the formation and control of the microrobotic swarm.

The formed PEGylated Au DENPs was used for both enhanced CT imaging of human laryngeal squamous carcinoma cells (Hep-2 cells) and the xenograft tumor mode, and indirect CT lymphography imaging in New Zealand rabbits.In vitro cytotoxicity assay, flow cytometry analysis, and cell morphology observation revealed that the formed PEGylated Au DENPs were non-cytotoxic at a Au concentration up to 400 Î¼M for 24 h and indicated their good biocompatibility. Transmission electron microscopy data confirmed that the PEGylated Au DENPs was uptaken dominantly by the lysosomes of the cells. The PEGylated Au DENPs enabled not only enhance CT imaging of a xenograft tumor model in nude mice after intravenous injection of the particles, but also effective indirect CT lymphography imaging in rabbits. These findings suggest that the designed PEGylated Au DENPs can be used as a potentially effective contrast agent for CT imaging of various biological systems and different kinds of carcinoma, especially lymphatic mapping and human laryngeal squamous carcinoma.

Over 0.189 million liters of effluent at each of the seven tertiary plants were filtered using an assembled stack of sieves with mesh sizes between 400 and 45 Î¼m. Additionally, the surface of 28.4 million liters of final effluent at three tertiary plants was skimmed using a 125 Î¼m filtering assembly.

Eight rabbits with VX2 tumor in the liver underwent one of four treatments: (i) nanoembolization (NE) with radiolabeled, hollow gold nanoparticles loaded with doxorubicin (64Cu-PEG-HAuNS-DOX); (ii) NE+RFA; (iii) NE+IRE; (iv) NE+LITT. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging was obtained 1-hr or 18-hrs after intervention. Tissue samples were collected for autoradiography and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. PET/CT imaging at 1-hr showed focal deposition of oil and nanoparticles in the tumor only after NE+RFA but at 18-hrs, all animals had focal accumulation of oil and nanoparticles in the tumor region. Autoradiograph analysis demonstrated nanoparticle deposition in the tumor and in the ablated tissues adjacent to the tumor when NE was combined with ablation. TEM results showed the intracellular uptake of nanoparticles in tumor only after NE+IRE. Nanoparticles demonstrated a structural change, suggesting direct interaction, potentially leading to drug release, only after NE+LITT. The findings demonstrate that a combined NE and ablation treatment technique for liver tumors is feasible, resulting in deposition of nanoparticles in and around the tumor. Depending on the ablative energy applied, different effects are seen on nanoparticle localization and structure. These effects should be considered when designing nanoparticles for use in combination with ablation technologies.

The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains and lack of effective anti-TB drugs are threatening the future control of TB. The present multidrug regimen against TB needs daily administration for at least 6 months, and patients often fail to follow this complex regimen for such a long interval, thus leading to patient non-compliance and treatment related side effects. To avoid daily dosing, application of nanotechnology is a promising solution by virtue of sustained drug release. Nanotechnology-based rational targeting may improve therapeutic success by limiting adverse drug effects and requiring less frequent administration regimens, ultimately resulting in higher patient compliance, and thus attain higher adherence levels. Today, the pipeline of potential new treatments consists of several compounds in clinical trials or preclinical development with promising activities against sensitive and resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.

Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were synthesized as artificial antibodies towards histamine by utilizing the interaction between histamine and a functional monomer (methacrylic acid) to impress specific binding sites on polymer particles after polymerization. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was used to immobilize the MIPs, yielding a MIPs-PVC film that functioned as a recognition element to specifically separate histamine from tuna extract. A gold colloid solution served both as an eluting solvent to extract histamine from MIPs-PVC film and furnish a substrate for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection of histamine signals. Principal component analysis together with a partial least square regression (PLSR) model (R2 = 0.947, RMSECV = 3.526) verified the reliability of MIPs-PVC-SERS approach for the detection and spectral analysis of histamine. Linear regression models were also constructed to relate the intensity of different histamine SERS bands with the corresponding spiking levels. One such model (using a band at 1576 cm-1) performed slightly better in predicting histamine content in tuna than the PLSR model. We conclude that our new MIPs-PVC-SERS approach can rapidly and reliably determine histamine at levels from 3 to 90 ppm in canned tuna meat.

With human population increasing, it is expected that the prevalence of plastic debris in the environment will also increase, unless sustainable daily habits are incorporated, waste management improved, and new alternative materials are discovered and popularized. To date, several reports show negative effects of plastic debris on marine and freshwater fauna (e.g. invertebrates, birds, turtles, marine mammals). Plastic are ubiquitous in the water column, deposited in fine sediments and enter the guts, respiratory structures and tissues of different aquatic species, and are incorporated into food webs via ingestion. This global problem also affects beach and near-shore activities (e.g. tourism, fisheries, and aquaculture) with negative social and economic consequences. The research of plastics effect on aquatic environments in Uruguay is only incipient. With the aim of contributing to scientific knowledge, decision-making and the management of plastic debris, here we reviewed the available information on plastic debris sources, their impacts on biodiversity, and policy issues in Uruguayan aquatic systems. Moreover, we reviewed and systematized community outreach initiatives, and examined national policies and management initiatives. We found that Uruguayan aquatic systems (freshwater, coastal marine and benthic) are affected by plastic pollution, both from land-based and sea-based activities, although national-level policies are modern and well suited for minimizing the impacts of plastic pollution. We reviewed biota-plastic debris interactions, and found evidence for impacts on a number of aquatic taxa, including the poorly reported ingestion of microplastics in freshwaters fishes and the association with plastic benthic debris. Global and regional hydrographic settings (RÃ­o de la Plata Estuary), as well as idiosyncratic ecological, socio-economic and cultural issues, make Uruguay a valuable test-site for this topic. Our ultimate goal is to minimize the effects of this widespread environmental, economic, health and aesthetic problem.","Cited By :13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Traditional 3D printing methods involve the use of heat, toxic organic solvents, or toxic photoinitiators for fabrication of synthetic scaffolds. In this study, two thermoresponsive water-based biodegradable polyurethane dispersions (PU1 and PU2) were synthesized which may form gel near 37 Â°C without any crosslinker. The stiffness of the hydrogel could be easily fine-tuned by the solid content of the dispersion. Neural stem cells (NSCs) were embedded into the polyurethane dispersions before gelation. The dispersions containing NSCs were subsequently printed and maintained at 37 Â°C. The NSCs in 25-30% PU2 hydrogels (~680-2400 Pa) had excellent proliferation and differentiation but not in 25-30% PU1 hydrogels. Moreover, NSC-laden 25-30% PU2 hydrogels injected into the zebrafish embryo neural injury model could rescue the function of impaired nervous system. However, NSC-laden 25-30% PU1 hydrogels only showed a minor repair effect in the zebrafish model. In addition, the function of adult zebrafish with traumatic brain injury was rescued after implantation of the 3D-printed NSC-laden 25% PU2 constructs. Therefore, the newly developed 3D bioprinting technique involving NSCs embedded in the thermoresponsive biodegradable polyurethane ink offers new possibilities for future applications of 3D bioprinting in neural tissue engineering.

Research regarding marine environments has led to a substantial increase in knowledge, yet little is known as regards the situation in freshwater environments. Although the occurrence of microplastics was demonstrated in Lake Geneva in 2012, the present research aims at confirming this pollution and expanding the data set for other lakes and environments of Switzerland. AbstractMarine microplastic (<5mm) water pollution has met growing public and scientific interest in the last few years. The situation in freshwater environments remains largely unknown, although it appears that they play an important role as part of the origin of marine pollution. Apart from the physical impacts on biota, chemical effects are to be expected as well, especially with smaller particles. This study aims at assessing plastic abundance in Lakes Geneva, Constance, NeuchÃ¢tel, Maggiore, Zurich and Brienz, and identifying the nature of the particles, potential ingestion by birds and fishes, and the associated pollutants. Lake surface transects and a few rivers were sampled using a floating manta net, and beach sediments were analysed. Plastics were sorted by type (fragments, pellets, cosmetic beads, lines, fibres, films, foams) and composition (polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, etc.); fish and water birds were dissected to assess their potential exposure, and analyses were conducted on the hydrophobic micropollutants adsorbed to the microplastics as well as some potentially toxic additives they contained. Evidence of this pollution is shown for all lakes, microplastics of all types and diverse composition having been found in all samples. Birds and fish are prone to microplastic ingestion, and all the tested chemicals (both adsorbed micropollutants and contained additives) were found above the detection limit, and often the quantification limit. The sources and their respective contribution need to be confirmed and quantified, and the ecotoxicological effects need further investigation. Other questions remain open, including the transport and fate of plastic particles in the environment.

They originate from the direct release of particles of plastic and as a consequence of the fragmentation of larger items. Microplastics are widespread in marine habitats from the poles to the equator; from the sea surface and shoreline to the deep sea. They are ingested by a range of organisms including commercially important fish and shellfish and in some populations the incidence of ingestion is extensive. Laboratory studies indicateï¿½that ingestion could cause harmful toxicological and/or physical effects. However, our understanding of the relative importance of these effects in natural populations is very limited. Looking to the future it seems inevitable that the quantity of microplastic will increase in the environment, since even if we could stop new items of debris entering the ocean, fragmentation of the items already present would continue for years to come. The term microplastics has only been in popular usage for a decade and while many questions remain about the extent to which they could have harmful effects, the solutions to reducing this contamination are at hand. There are considerable synergies to be achieved by designing plastic items for both their lifetime in service and their efficient end-of-life recyclability, since capturing waste via recycling will reduce usage of non-renewable oil and gas used in the production of new plastics and at the same time reduce the accumulation of waste in managed facilities such as land fill as well as in the natural environment.

Open-water surveys reveal that, in certain areas of the Great Lakes, surface water densities of plastics are as high as those reported for areas of litter accumulation within oceanic gyres. Data from volunteer beach cleanups show that typically more than 80% of anthropogenic litter along the shorelines of the Great Lakes is comprised of plastics. The distribution of plastics in bottom sediments of the Great Lakes is essentially unknown. Sources of plastic debris to the Great Lakes include microplastic beads from consumer products, pellets from the plastic manufacturing industry, and waste from beach-goers, shipping, and fishing activities. Many plastics degrade slowly in the environment and may have long-term adverse ecological and economic impacts, including the dispersal of persistent organic pollutants. Plans to combat and curtail plastic debris pollution in the Great Lakes will come at a significant economic cost, likely in excess of $400 million annually. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on plastic pollution in the Great Lakes, identify knowledge gaps, and suggest future research directions.

By contrast, the initial steps leading to the formation of a tissue structure, through cell-cell adhesion, have so far been described only for small numbers of interacting cells. Here, through the use of remote magnetic forces, we succeeded at creating cell aggregates of half million cells, instantaneously and for several cell types, not only those known to form spheroids. This magnetic compaction gives access to the cell elasticity, found in the range of 800 Pa. The magnetic force can be removed at any time, allowing the cell mass to evolve spontaneously thereafter. The dynamics of contraction of these cell aggregates just after their formation (or, in contrast, their spreading for non-interacting monocyte cells) provides direct information on cell-cell interactions and allows retrieving the adhesion energy, in between 0.05 and 2 mJ m-2, depending on the cell type tested, and in the case of cohesive aggregates. Thus, we show, by probing a large number of cell types, that cell aggregates behave like complex materials, undergoing a transition from a wet granular to contractile network, and that this transition is controlled by cell-cell interactions.

We sampled 10 freshwater sites along a 320 km section from Lake St. Francis to QuÃ©bec City by passing sediment collected from a benthic grab through a 500 _m sieve. Microbeads were discovered throughout this section, and their abundances varied by four orders of magnitude across sites.

In addition, they may potentially influence the toxicity of other contaminants in the marine environment. The aim of this study was to clarify whether polyethylene microspheres (1-5 Î¼m) modulate short-term toxicity of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene to juveniles (0+ group) of the common goby (Pomatoschistus microps). Fish were exposed for 96 h to pyrene (20 and 200 Î¼g L-1) in the absence and presence of microplastics (0, 18.4 and 184 Î¼g L-1). Mortality, bile pyrene metabolites, and biomarkers involved in neurotransmission, aerobic energy production, biotransformation and oxidative stress were quantified. Microplastics delayed pyrene-induced fish mortality and increased the concentration of bile pyrene metabolites. Microplastics, alone or in combination with pyrene, significantly reduced acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, an effect also observed for pyrene alone. The mixture also decreased isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) activity. No significant effects were found for glutathione S-transferase activity or lipid peroxidation. Overall, results show that: (i) microplastics modulate either the bioavailability or biotransformation of pyrene; (ii) simultaneous exposure to microplastics and pyrene decrease the energy available through the aerobic pathway of energy production; and (iii) microplastics inhibit AChE activity. The mechanism for AChE inhibition appeared to be different for pyrene and microplastics, since simultaneous exposure to both did not increase significantly the inhibitory effect. The observed neurotoxic effects of microplastics per se and the effects on IDH activity of the two stressors combined are of concern because they may increase mortality in natural fish populations. More studies need to be carried out on possible combined effects of microplastics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on fish, particularly juveniles. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

While there has been a wealth of studies on the short-term acute toxic effects of ENMs over the past decade, work on the chronic endpoints, such as biological accumulation, has just begun to increase in last 2-3 years. Here, we comprehensively review over 65 papers on the biological accumulation of ENMs under a range of ecologically relevant exposure conditions in water, soil or sediment with the focus on quantitative comparison among these existing studies. We found that daphnid, fish, and earthworm are the most commonly studied ecological receptors. Current evidence suggests that ENM accumulation level is generally low in fish and earthworms with logarithmic bioconcentration concentration factor and biota-sediment accumulation factor ranging from 0.85-3.43 (L kg-1) and -2.21-0.4 (kg kg-1), respectively. ENMs accumulated in organisms at the lower trophic level can transfer to higher trophic level animals with the occurrence of biomagnification varying depending on the specific food chain studied. We conclude the review by identifying the challenges and knowledge gaps and propose paths forward.

Already, nanoparticles (NPs) of titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), silver (Ag) and other metals or their oxides are present in commercial products such as sunscreens, cosmetics, wound dressings, surgical tools, detergents, automotive paints and tires. More recent and advanced FDA-approved use of NMs includes quantum dots (QDs) in live cell imaging, zirconium oxides in bone replacement and prosthetic devices and nanocarriers in drug delivery. The benefits from nanotechnology are aplenty, comprising antimicrobial activities, scratch- and water-resistance, long-lasting shine, improved processor speeds and better display resolution, to name a few. While developers of these products often focus on the exciting beneficial aspects of their products, safety and toxicity issues are often not discussed in detail. Long-term effects such as chronic exposure and environmental pollution are even less documented. Along with widespread manufacture and use of NMs, concerns for occupational hazards, proper handling, disposal, storage, shipping and clean up are expected to rise.

Other important considerations include a good premixing system for initial wetting, and proper formulation, not only for particle stabilization, but to control viscosity to allow efficient bead separation. In the dispersion process, lower density beads might be the better choice of media, to prevent breaking particles beyond their primary size and destroying surface coating. Conversely, grinding may require high-density beads for particle fracturing. Grinding can be a very cost-effective means of particle reduction. Production costs per kilogram are typically in the $0.02-$0.10 range, which compares favorably to chemical processes. Grinding equipment also costs less to install and operate than most chemical processes. Also, with fewer chemicals present in the process, there is less potential for hazardous waste, so the workplace environment is safer. In the interest of full disclosure, we know of two disadvantages to the use of bead mills in grinding operations. First, minute particles may break away from some grinding media and contaminate some products. The mass deposited in the product may be as low as one part per million, or approach 1,000 parts per million, but the potential exists. Second, some materials simply cannot be ground by a bead mill, given the current technology. Polymers like PTFE and Nylon, for example, pose challenges because they are not ""friable."" Particle reduction for materials like these is a very expensive venture, as it requires some sort of cryogenic process.","Export Date: 13 June 2021 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The biological activity of the wear debris is dependent on the size and volume of the particles produced. Wear volume also plays an important role in the functional biological activity of a joint replacement. In vitro studies have shown that crosslinking of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) acetabular cups and tibial trays produces a reduction in wear volume, and crosslinking has now been introduced clinically for both types of prostheses. Previous studies have identified both micron and submicron-sized polyethylene wear particles. The aim of this study was to characterize the wear and wear particles generated from moderately crosslinked GUR 1020 GVF UHMWPE acetabular cups and tibial trays in hip and knee joint wear simulators down to 10 nanometers in size. The wear rates of the two prosthesis types were very similar at 25.6 Â± 5.3 mm3 per million cycles for the hip prostheses and 22.75 Â± 5.95 mm3 per million cycles for the knee prostheses. Nanometer-sized wear particles were isolated and characterized from both hip and knee simulator lubricants for the first time. Significantly higher numbers (p &lt; 0.05) of particles in the nanometer (&lt;0.1 Î¼m) size range were produced by the hip prostheses compared to the knee prostheses. The knee prostheses produced larger particles, with the mode of particle size in the 0.1-1.0 Î¼m size range, compared to &lt;0.1 Î¼m size range for the hip prostheses. In addition, the knee prostheses produced a greater volumetric concentration of wear particles in the 1.0-10 Î¼m size range, and consequently lower specific biological activity and functional biological activity indices. These results indicated that the knee prostheses had a lower osteolytic potential compared to the hip prostheses.

For scalable hierarchical simulations, we have developed parallel linear-scaling algorithms for (1) DFT calculation based on a divide-and-conquer algorithm on adaptive multigrids, (2) chemically reactive MD based on a fast ReaxFF (F-ReaxFF) algorithm, and (3) EFF-MD based on a space-time multiresolution MD (MRMD) algorithm. On 1920 Intel Itanium2 processors, we have demonstrated 1.4 million atom (0.12 trillion grid points) DFT, 0.56 billion atom F-ReaxFF, and 18.9 billion atom MRMD calculations, with parallel efficiency as high as 0.953. Through the use of these algorithms, multimillion atom MD simulations have been performed to study the oxidation of an aluminum nanoparticle. Structural and dynamic correlations in the oxide region are calculated as well as the evolution of charges, surface oxide thickness, diffusivities of atoms, and local stresses. In the microcanonical ensemble, the oxidizing reaction becomes explosive in both molecular and atomic oxygen environments, due to the enormous energy release associated with Al-O bonding. In the canonical ensemble, an amorphous oxide layer of a thickness of âˆ¼40 Ã… is formed after 466 ps, in good agreement with experiments. Simulations have been performed to study nanoindentation on crystalline, amorphous, and nanocrystalline silicon nitride and silicon carbide. Simulation on nanocrystalline silicon carbide reveals unusual deformation mechanisms in brittle nanophase materials, due to coexistence of brittle grains and soft amorphous-like grain boundary phases. Simulations predict a crossover from intergranular continuous deformation to intragrain discrete deformation at a critical indentation depth.

After extraction, analyses were performed using ion chromatography (IC). The Ag-NPs coated porous polypropylene membrane shows higher extraction efficiency due to the high electrical conductivity of the silver nanoparticles. The performance of this efficient technique was compared with those previously reported in the literature. The extraction variables that affect extraction of the target analyte and influencing % recovery, such as pH of sample solution, extraction time and applied voltage, were investigated and optimized. Results demonstrated sample solution (pH=6), short extraction time (10 min), and applied voltage of 5 V was found to be the optimum conditions to achieve low detection limits (LODs).

Household sewage, fishery activity, and navigation appear to be the principal sources of the artificial particles ingested by the reef fishes. Our results provide an important database on oceanic contamination by microplastics and artificial cellulose particles. Understanding this impact on tropical reef fish will contribute to the development of strategies to mitigate pollution by anthropogenic debris in reef systems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33962257,

As such, gut microbiomes of aquatic animals are susceptible targets for toxicity. Recent studies conducted in teleost fishes report that microplastics and plasticizers (e.g., phthalates, bisphenol A) induce gastrointestinal dysbiosis and alter microbial diversity in the gastrointestinal system. Here we synthesize the current state of the science regarding plastics, plasticizers, and their effects on microbiomes of fish. Literature suggests that microplastics and plasticizers increase the abundance of opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms (e.g. Actinobacillus, Mycoplasma and Stenotrophomonas) in fish and reveal that gamma-proteobacteria are sensitive to microplastics. Recommendations moving forward for the research field include (1) environmentally relevant exposures to improve understanding of the long-term impacts of microplastic and plasticizer contamination on the fish gastrointestinal microbiome; (2) investigation into the potential impacts of understudied polymers such as polypropylene, polyamide and polyester, and (3) studies with elastomers such as rubbers that are components of tire materials, as these chemicals often dominate plastic debris. Focus on both microplastics and the gut microbiota is intensifying in environmental toxicology, and herein lies an opportunity to improve evaluation of global ecological impacts associated with plastic contamination. This is important as the microbiota is intimately tied to an individual's health and fragmentation of microbial community networks and gut dysbiosis can result in disease susceptibility and early mortality events.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33930774,

In this context, a field-level study was conducted on the fishing grounds of the north eastern part of the Arabian Sea through experimental fishing, and the gastrointestinal tracts (GT) of three different species of shrimps (n=180) were examined for the incidence of microplastics. The results showed that all shrimp caught from the fishing grounds had significant levels of MPs in the gastrointestinal tracts. A total number of 1220 microplastic items were recorded from the pooled samples, with an average of 6.78 Â± 2.80 items per individual. The gastrointestinal tract showed an average number of 70.32 Â± 34.67 MPs per gram of the gut material. The MPs with the size range of 100-250 Î¼m were the most abundant form found in the shrimp species analyzed. Among the colored MP particles, black color was the most dominant (30.16%) form of MP. Fibers, fragments, pellets, beads, and films were the common morphotypes; however, fibers showed an occurrence of 39.40%, 47.39%, and 41.89% in the GTs of Metapenaeus monoceros, Parapeneopsis stylifera, and Penaeus indicus, respectively. In the present study, six types of plastic polymers were identified from the GTs of the studied samples. The findings confirm the presence of microplastics in the natural habitats of shrimps beyond the coast and indicate that shrimps caught from these coastal fishing grounds contain MPs in their gut. The findings underline the immediate scientific intervention for the microplastic reduction in the marine environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33907955,

This study confirmed the in vitro magnetic potential of magnetite Nano-Particles (Fe(3)O(4) NPs) against waterborne Hg exposure-induced toxicity in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). We further evaluate the safety profile of Fe(3)O(4) NPs on fish growth, hemato-biochemical, histological parameters, bioaccumulation in muscles, and economy. Magnetite nanoparticles were characterized, adsorption loading to Hg ions was investigated, and testing different concentrations of Fe(3)O(4) NPs (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0Â mg/L) was applied to determine the highest concentration of adsorption. An in vivo experiment includes 120 fish with an average weight of 26.2Â Â±Â 0.26Â g were randomly divided into 4 equal groups, each group had three replicates (nÂ =Â 30 fish/group; 10 fish/ replicate).

The second group (G(2)) received 1.0Â mg/L aqueous suspension of Fe(3)O(4) NPs. The third group (G(3)) was exposed to an aqueous solution of Hg ions at a concentration of 0.025Â mg/L. Meanwhile, the fourth group (G(4)) acquired an aqueous suspension composed of a mixture of Hg ions and Fe(3)O(4) NPs as previously mentioned. Throughout the exposure period, the clinical signs, symptoms, and mortalities were recorded. The Hg ions-exposed group induced the following consequences; reduced appetite resulting in reduced growth and less economic efficiency; microcytic hypochromic anemia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, and neutrophilia; sharp and clear depletion in the immune indicators including lysozymes activity, immunoglobulin M (IgM), and Myeloperoxidase activities (MPO); significant higher levels of ALT, AST, urea, creatinine, and Superoxide dismutase (SOD); histological alterations of gill, hepatic and muscular tissues with strong expression of apoptotic marker (caspase 3); and a higher accumulation of Hg ions in the muscles. Surprisingly, Fe(3)O(4) NPs-supplemented groups exhibited strong adsorption capacity against the Hg ions and mostly removed the Hg ions accumulation in the muscles. Also, the hematological, biochemical, and histological parameters were recovered. Thus, in order to assess the antitoxic role of Fe(3)O(4) NPs against Hg and their safety on O. niloticus, and fill the gap of the research, the current context was investigated to evaluate the promising role of Fe(3)O(4) NPs to prevent Hg-exposure-induced toxicity and protection of fish health, which ascertains essentiality for sustainable development ofÂ nanotechnology in the aquatic environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",33901865,

It is well-known to everyone that the ultimate end for most of the plastic debris is the ocean. The distribution of plastic rubbish in the oceans is strongly influenced by hydrodynamic properties of water. The continuous break down of plastic objects, as a consequence of thermal, chemical and biological processes along with various environmental factors, results into microplastics (MPs). The microplastics are those particles which are deriving pallets of plastic, having length of less than 5 mm or 0.2 in. Nowadays microplastics are everywhere in the waters all around the world. The high dispersion pattern of oceanic currents takes away microplastics in the entire ocean even to remote areas, like the Polar Regions. Microplastics are difficult to remove from the ocean and the ingestion of these particles by several consumers of different trophic levels like benthos, birds, and fishes is a threat to the diverse food webs and ecosystems. Different scientific investigations have ascertained that a significant concentration of MPs are present in various marine ecosystems globally including the Polar region (both Arctic and Antarctic), and in the upcoming future, the condition is expected to get worse. The objective of this review is to establish a baseline evidence for the availability of microplastics in the polar region.

MPs and Cu, single or combined, caused neurotoxicity in larvae by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity. There was an increased and significant effect of CuÂ +Â MPs groups on the evaluated biomarkers, concerning the corresponding Cu groups, suggesting that MPs may have a synergistic effect in relation to Cu.

Microplastics accumulated on the eggshell and reduced embryonic hatching rate and larval body length and weight. Similarly, 150 days of microplastic exposure decreased body mass and gonadosomatic index of adult fish, but accelerated sexual maturity of female fish, showing a trade-off between growth and reproduction. Microplastic exposure also caused obvious histopathological damages to gonads and decreased egg productions and fertilization rates. Moreover, parental microplastic exposure induced elevated heartbeats, premature hatching, and slow growth in F(1) offspring. Anti-oxidative stress response, sex hormone disruption, and disturbed transcription of steroidogenic genes in the reproductive axis could partially explain the reproduction impairment and transgenerational trade-offs. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed that the steroid hormone biosynthesis and cytochrome P450 pathways in the testes of male fish were significantly affected after 20Â Î¼g/L microplastic exposure.

In conclusion, MPs exposure induced an increase of antioxidant defences in the liver of S. aurata. However, these elevated antioxidant capabilities were not enough to prevent oxidative damage in the liver since, an increased oxidative damage marker was associated with MPs ingestion. The treatment with seawater exposed MPs caused a more significant antioxidant response (CAT, GRs, and GST).

The development of personalized human in vitro platforms to evaluate the interaction of nanomaterials with the vascular system would be important for both therapeutic and regenerative medicine. A library of 30 nanoparticle (NP) formulations, in use in imaging, antimicrobial and pharmaceutical applications, was evaluated in a reporter zebrafish model of vasculogenesis and then tested in personalized humanized models composed of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived endothelial cells (ECs) with ""young"" and ""aged"" phenotypes in 3 vascular network formats: 2D (in polystyrene dish), 3D (in Matrigel) and in a blood vessel on a chip. As a proof of concept, vascular toxicity was used as the main readout. The results show that the toxicity profile of NPs to hiPSC-ECs was dependent on the ""age"" of the endothelial cells and vascular network format. hiPSC-ECs were less susceptible to the cytotoxicity effect of NPs when cultured in flow than in static conditions, the protective effect being mediated, at least in part, by glycocalyx.

Fish were intraperitoneally injected and a multi-level assessment was carried out 3 and 7 days later. Oxybenzone and titanium dioxide nanoparticles induced mild effects on turbot, both isolated and in mixture. Neither oxidative stress (intestine, liver and kidney) nor neurotoxicity (brain) was found. However, liver metabolic function was altered after 7 days, suggesting the impairment of the aerobic metabolism. An increased motility rate in oxybenzone treatment was the only behavioural alteration (day 7). The intestine and liver were preferentially targeted, while kidney and brain were unaffected. Both infra- and supra-additive interactions were perceived, with a toxicodynamic nature, resulting either in favourable or unfavourable toxicological outcomes, which were markedly dependent on the organ, parameter and post-injection time. The combined exposure to the UV filters did not show a consistent increment in toxicity in comparison with the isolated exposures, which is an ecologically relevant finding providing key information towards the formulation of environmentally safe sunscreen products.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",33557180,PMC7913899

Contamination of FM by microplastics (MPs), the synthetic polymer particles known to be nearly ubiquitous in the marine environment, is a likely consequence of their ingestion by zooplankton and other small marine animals that through the food chain end up in the fish commercialized not only for direct human consumption but also for the industrial production of FM. Unfortunately, analytical tools for quantifying contamination of FM by synthetic polymers are not available. A newly developed procedure described here allows quantification of the total amounts of polyolefins (including ethene and propene homo- and copolymers), polystyrene (PS), and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), respectively, in FM. The multi-step procedure involves a sequence of solvent extractions, hydrolytic treatments to remove the biogenic matrix mainly consisting of proteins and some lipids, and selective depolymerization for PET. The gravimetric and SEC-UV techniques employed for the quantification of polyolefins and PS, respectively, only allowed to estimate their concentration in FM at around or below 100Â mg/kg each, a more accurate quantification being prevented by the interference from the organic matrix and, in the case of polyolefins, by the limited sensitivity of the quantification by gravimetry. On the other hand, the contamination by PET MPs could accurately be quantified at 12.9Â mg/kg based on the dry FM mass. Ways to overcome the sensitivity limitations for PS and polyolefins by using e.g. pyrolysis-GC/MS are highlighted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33493766,

We assessed the relative importance of the two exposure routes using mysids (Neomysis spp.) and a benthic fish (Myoxocephalus brandti) as a model prey-predator system. We first exposed the mysids to fluorescent polyethylene beads (27-32Â Î¼m) at concentrations of 200 and 2000Â Î¼g/L. We then exposed the fish to water containing the same concentrations of polyethylene beads or to nine mysids pre-exposed to polyethylene beads. We quantified the size and overall mass of polyethylene beads in mysids and in fish to assess polyethylene beads fragmentation by the mysids. Mysids ingested 2-3 more polyethylene beads from water containing the higher concentration, and fish ingested 3-11 times more polyethylene beads via trophic transfer than from the water column. The percentage of fragmented particles was higher in mysids and in fish fed bead-exposed mysids, suggesting that the mysids can fragment polyethylene beads. Our experiments demonstrate that trophic transfer is a major route of microplastic ingestion by fish and that prey such as mysids can fragment microplastics. Small particles can translocate from the digestive system into tissues and exert adverse physiological effects. Trophic transfer of microplastics may therefore pose more serious threats to organisms at higher trophic levels.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""Only: \""Following measurement of their wet weight\""""]}",33477061,

The present work aimed at investigating the physiological and behavioral effects of thirty-six juvenile Sparus aurata exposed to control, virgin and weathered MPs enriched diets during a 21-day period under controlled conditions. Physiological effects were assessed in liver and brain using the following biomarkers: activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GRd), the detoxifying enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) and malondialdehyde (MDA) as indicative of lipid peroxidation. Individuals were recorded for behavior analysis (i.e. social interactions and feeding behavior). Results revealed an increase in cellular stress from control to weathered fish groups, with the virgin group showing intermediate levels in all quantified biomarkers. Significant differences were found in the liver for all biomarkers except for MDA, suggesting that exposure time to MPs in this experiment is long enough to trigger the activation of antioxidant enzymes but not to produce cell damage by lipid peroxidation. In brain tissue samples, fish from the weathered group presented significantly higher values for CAT and SOD, highlighting its function as primary antioxidants. Regarding behavioral effects, results showed that the two MPs enriched groups were significantly bolder during social interactions and, although no significantly, tended to be more active during feeding. In conclusion, MPs which have been weathered in marine environmental conditions produces a higher physiological response than virgin MPs but also, a physiological response is variable depending on the tissue analyzed. In addition, a short period to MP exposure seems to affect overall social and feeding behavior but, further research is needed to assess long-term effects of MP ingestion and its potential consequences on fish populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Included"", ""Querusche""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext",33422861,

Despite its promising therapeutic properties, GB has poor bioavailability following oral administration and cannot readily achieve sufficient exposure in treated patients, limiting its clinical application for the treatment of PD. In an effort to improve its efficacy, we utilized poly(ethylene glycol)-co-poly(Îµ-caprolactone) (PEG-PCL) nanoparticles as a means of encapsulating GB (GB-NPs). These NPs facilitated the sustained release of GB into the blood, thereby improving its ability to accumulate in the brain and to treat PD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, we were able to confirm that these NPs could be taken into cells via multiple nonspecific mechanisms including micropinocytosis, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and lipid raft/caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Once internalized, these NPs tended to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes. In zebrafish, we determined that these NPs were readily able to undergo transport across the chorion, gastrointestinal, blood-brain, and blood-retinal barriers. In a 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+))-induced neuronal damage model system, we confirmed the neuroprotective potential of these NPs. Following oral administration to rats, GB-NPs exhibited more desirable pharmacokinetics than did free GB, achieving higher GB concentrations in both the brain and the blood. Using a murine PD model, we demonstrated that these GB-NPs achieved superior therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicity relative to free GB. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these results indicate that NPs encapsulation of GB can significantly improve its oral bioavailability, cerebral accumulation, and bioactivity via mediating its sustained release in vivo.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",33380795,PMC7769078

Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. METHODS: In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 Î¼g per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. RESULTS: A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older.

Non-exposed animals were the only ones showing increased activity/locomotion time in the presence of the predatory stimulus during the individual anti-predatory response test. The behavior of animals directly confronted with a potential predator has evidenced the influence of NPs on shoals' aggregation and on the distance kept by individuals from the predatory stimulus. These changes were associated with PS NPs accumulation in animals' brains, oxidative stress and increased acetylcholinesterase activity (hepatic and cerebral).

So far, there have been few assessments of microplastics in freshwater salmonids. The prevalence (i.e. percentage occurrence) and burden (i.e. abundance per fish) of microplastics were assessed in the gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) and stomach contents (SCs) of 58 brown trout Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758 sampled at six sites along the River Slaney catchment in south-east Ireland. Sites were divided into two classifications (high and low exposure) based on proximity to microplastic pollution sources, comprising three sites each. Analysis of biological traits (e.g. fish length) and diet was performed on the same fish to determine possible factors explaining microplastic burden. Microplastics were found in 72% of fish having been recovered from 66% of GITs (1.88Â Â±Â 1.53Â MPs fishâ»(1)) and 28% of SCs (1.31Â Â±Â 0.48Â MPs fishâ»(1)). Fibres were the dominant particle type recovered from GITs (67%) and SCs (57%) followed by fragments. No difference in median microplastic burden was observed between fish collected in high and low exposure sites. Microplastic burden was unrelated to fish fork length, while microplastic size distribution (100Â â‰¤Â 350Â Î¼m, 350Â Î¼m toÂ â‰¤Â 5Â mm) was unrelated to S.Â trutta age class estimates. Furthermore, microplastic burden was not explained by dietary intake. Though further research is necessary, this study showed the presence of microplastics in wild S.Â trutta collected from an Irish riverine system, which could have further implications for top-level consumers that feed on the species, including humans. Further analysis is required to determine possible trophic linkages for the species, with respect to microplastics, and to assess the suitability of S.Â trutta for monitoring microplastics in river systems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33254617,

This protocol enables initial characterization of the sample through dissection followed by chemical dissolution to isolate polymer debris while minimizing analytical uncertainties and maintaining microplastic particle integrity. The extraction method begins with dissection and inspection of the stomach contents, followed by pulsed ultrasonic extraction to remove the majority of biomass and surface contaminants. Subsequent chemical dissolution of the extracted contents using KOH and HCl removes any remaining biomass and inorganic interferences. Incorporating chemical dissolution post-extraction minimizes the overall biomass subjected to dissolution, thereby enabling faster processing and subsequently a cleaner sample compared to methods involving digestion of the entire organism. Furthermore, the chemical dissolution step enables direct filter analysis for microplastics, thereby minimizing the potential loss of microplastic particles associated with manual particle transfer.

Ecotoxicoproteomics has been employed to elucidate biological pathways affected by chemicals and provide data that can be incorporated into adverse outcome pathways (AOP) to better define the ecological risk of emerging pollutants. Microplastics (MPs) and plastic additives have raised global concern due to their widespread use in aquatic environments, bioaccumulation in tissues, and toxic effects in aquatic organisms. Despite showing sublethal toxicity in many cases, mechanisms underlying these emerging pollutants are underexplored. In this review, adverse effects and recent ecotoxicoproteomic studies of MPs and typical additives (i.e. plasticizers, flame retardants, antioxidants, and UV stabilizers) in aquatic organisms are summarized. Proteomics data show that MPs adversely affect ingestion and reproduction via disrupting pathways related to energy metabolism, stress-related defense, and cytoskeletal dynamics. Biological processes including lipid metabolism, energy homeostasis, skeletal development, neurotransmitter signaling, and immune response are modulated by additives and induce developmental malformations in fish embryos/larvae. Furthermore, plastic additives also exert reproductive toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and neurotoxicity in invertebrates (e.g. mussel, abalone, and oyster) and fish by disrupting detoxification/oxidative stress, hormonal modulation, signal transduction, and apoptosis. Additional studies are needed to complement the omic knowledge of chemical additives that are not well documented (e.g. UV stabilizers) for improving understanding into toxic mechanisms and for characterizing ecological risk linked to plastic contaminants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33075717,

The abundances of MPs in the three benthic species were significantly greater than those from the Bering Sea, but lower than those from other regions globally. The top three compositions of MPs in the three species were polyester, nylon, and polyethylene terephthalate. The detection limit for MP size in the present study was 0.03Â mm and the mean size of MP in the three species was 0.89Â Â±Â 0.06Â mm. The surfaces of MPs found in the starfish and crabs were covered with many attachments, cracks, and hollows, while the surfaces of MPs found in the sea anemones were smooth, which was likely a consequence of different feeding behaviors. There was a significantly positive correlation between the abundances of MPs and other anthropogenic substances. The mean MP abundances in the sea anemones ranged from 0.2 items/individual to 1.7 items/individual, which was significantly higher than that in the deposit-feeding starfish (0.1-1.4 items/individual) and snow crabs (0.0-0.6 items/individual). Sea anemones inhabiting lower latitudes ingested relatively higher levels of MPs than those inhabiting higher latitudes. The MP abundances in the sea anemones are significantly and positively correlated with the seasonal reduced ratio of sea ice coverage from August to September. Our findings indicate that sea anemones could function as a bioindicator of MP pollution, and that the MPs in the benthos from the Chukchi Sea might originate from the melting sea ice, fishery activities and ocean currents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33068580,

However, there is a lack of data on the concentration of nutrients and contaminants in fish and other seafood, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In order to assess the potential risks and benefits associated with seafood intake, reliable and up-to-date food composition data is crucial. The quality of food composition data is affected by several factors, such as sampling protocols and the suitability and quality of the methods applied for sample preparation and analysis. In this paper, we describe the sampling methodology and protocols related to the sampling of fish and other seafood and the corresponding analytical methods used to analyse the nutrient and contaminant content of such species. For nutrients, the determination of protein, fat, ash, energy, fatty acids, cholesterol, and amino acids is described, in addition to analyses for determination of the vitamin and mineral content in fish and other seafood. For contaminants, analyses for the determination of organic pollutants and microplastics are described. The methodology described in this paper is used for sampling data through scientific surveys in low- and middle-income countries with research vessel Dr. Fridtjof Nansen under the EAF-Nansen Programme. The Programme aims to improve knowledge on the nutritional composition of fish and ensure the fish is safe to consume.â€¢In this paper, we describe the sampling protocols used for sampling fish and other seafood during scientific surveys under the EAF-Nansen Programme.â€¢This paper describes the methodology and quality control for analysing nutrients and contaminants in fish and other seafood.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32995313,PMC7502570

However, because their guts are generally removed before consumption, exposure may be low compared to other routes such as shellfish, drinking water and dust. Still, microplastics have been found to translocate from the gut to other tissues, making exposure from eating fish fillets or other seafood products a potential concern. To better understand fish as an exposure route for microplastics in humans, we tested hypotheses about whether translocation occurs and if efficiency of translocation is dependent on particle size. We investigated the amount and distribution of fluorescent polyethylene microspheres (10-300 Î¼m) in the gut, liver, fillets and gonads of adult rainbow trout after a two-week dietary exposure. Fish were fed food pellets dosed with up to ~9,800 microspheres per gram of food. Total exposures over the entire experiment ranged from ~80,000-850,000 microspheres per fish. We did not find any particles in the fillets, liver, or gonads of any fish, suggesting that translocation of spherical microplastics of this size range does not occur in adult rainbow trout. The quantity of microplastics found in the gut was also low or absent after a 24-hour depuration period, indicating effective excretion in this laboratory population. This research suggests that the consumption of fish fillets may not be a significant exposure pathway for microspheres >10 Î¼m in size to contaminate humans.

A total of 32 sediment and 10 water samples were studied. The mean concentration of MPs was 15 units kg(-1) in the sediments and 710 units m(-3) in the coastal water. Fibers constituted by far the dominant MPs in both media, accounting for 97% of the MPs in both sediment and water samples. The MPs were mainly black in color. The dominant size of MP particles in sediment samples was between 250 and 500Â Î¼m, while the fraction >1000Â Î¼m dominated in the water samples. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), and nylon (NYL) were the main polymers and/or copolymers composing MPs in both sediment and water samples. The MP particles had a relatively smooth surface morphology, although signs of weathering were observed. The number of MP particles in sediment and water samples showed a general decrease from west to east in the study area. This may be reflecting the spreading of MP loading from the outlets of Sefidrud, Tonekabon, Chalus, the major rivers entering the Caspian Sea just west of the study area, and the overall decrease in the spatial distribution of touristic and fishery activity. The main sources of MP particles could be local emissions from a large number of domestic wastewater effluents and urban surface runoff due to high population density, and industrial and fishing activities in this region. This study indicated that MP particles, based on their characteristics and chemical composition, are circulated between coastal waters, and shore and sea surface sediments of the Caspian Sea, leading to their uneven distribution in the different depths.

The presence of marine and freshwater microplastic pollution is well documented in Chinook salmon habitat, yet no research has investigated the impacts to salmon from microplastic ingestion. The majority of the marine microplastics found in the Salish Sea are microfibers, synthetic extruded polymers that come from commonly worn clothing. To understand the potential impacts of microfiber ingestion to fish, we ran a feeding experiment with juvenile Chinook salmon to determine if ingested fibers are retained or digestion rates altered over a 10 day digestion period. The experiment was completed in two trials, each consisted of 20 control and 20 treatment fish. Treatment fish were each fed an amended ration of 12 food pellets spiked with 20 polyester microfibers and control fish were fed the same ration without added microfibers. Fish were sampled at day 0, 3, 5, 7, and 10 to assess if fibers were retained in their gastrointestinal tract and to determine the rate of digestion. Fibers for the experiment came from washing a red polyester fleece jacket in a microfiber retention bag. Fibers had a mean length of 4.98Â mm. Results showed fish were able to clear up to 94% of fed fibers over 10 days. Differences in mean gastrointestinal mass were not statistically significant at any sampled time between treatment and controls, suggesting that the ingestion of microfibers did not alter digestion rates. Further work is needed to understand if repeated exposures, expected in the environment, alter digestion or food assimilation for growth.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome,3 - Intervention | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""fiber particle size\n""]}",32806431,

Unfortunately, some of the discarded plastic can make its way into the environment and become fragmented into smaller microscopic particles, termed secondary microplastics (MP). In addition, primary MP, purposely manufactured microscopic plastic particles, can also make their way into our environment via various routes. Owing to their size and resilience, these MP can then be easily ingested by living organisms. The effect of MP particles on living organisms is suspected to have negative implications, especially during early development. In this study, we examined the effects of polyethylene MP ingestion for four and ten days of exposure starting at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). In particular, we examined the effects of polyethylene MP exposure on resting metabolic rate, on gene expression of several inflammatory and oxidative stress linked genes, and on microbiome composition between treatments. Overall, we found no evidence of broad metabolic disturbances or inflammatory markers in MP-exposed fish for either period of time. However, there was a significant increase in the oxidative stress mediator L-FABP that occurred at 15 dpf. Furthermore, the microbiome was disrupted by MP exposure, with evidence of an increased abundance of Bacteroidetes in MP fish, a combination frequently found in intestinal pathologies. Thus, it appears that acute polyethylene MP exposure can increase oxidative stress and dysbiosis, which may render the animal more susceptible to diseases.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Included"", ""Querusche""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Microbiota,ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext",32796641,PMC7560425

Accidental ingestion occurs in fish exposed to relatively small (1-5Â Âµm) microplastic particles without associated food or fish oil. Additionally, D. rerio effectively eliminated pristine microplastics 24Â h after ingestion; however, retention time was associated with increasing particle size and the intake of additional meals.

Materials and Methods A total of 21 VX2 liver tumor-bearing New Zealand white rabbits were used between October 2018 and February 2020. Rabbits were divided into three groups. Group A (n = 3) underwent intra-arterial infusion of gadolinium 160 ((160)Gd)-labeled anti-human leukocyte antigen-DR isotope (HLA-DR) antibodies to detect antigen-presenting immune cells. Group B (n = 3) received rhodamine-conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) intravenously to detect macrophages. These six rabbits underwent 3-T MRI, including T1- and T2-weighted imaging, before and 24 hours after contrast material administration. Group C (n = 15) underwent extracellular pH mapping with use of MR spectroscopy. Of those 15 rabbits, six underwent conventional transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), four underwent conventional TACE with extracellular pH-buffering bicarbonate, and five served as untreated controls. MRI signal intensity distribution was validated by using immunohistochemistry staining of HLA-DR and CD11b, Prussian blue iron staining, fluorescence microscopy of rhodamine, and imaging mass cytometry (IMC) of gadolinium. Statistical analysis included Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results T1-weighted MRI with (160)Gd-labeled antibodies revealed localized peritumoral ring enhancement, which corresponded to gadolinium distribution detected with IMC. T2-weighted MRI with SPIONs showed curvilinear signal intensity representing selective peritumoral deposition in macrophages. Extracellular pH-specific MR spectroscopy of untreated liver tumors showed acidosis (mean extracellular pH, 6.78 Â± 0.09) compared with liver parenchyma (mean extracellular pH, 7.18 Â± 0.03) (P = .008) and peritumoral immune cell exclusion. Normalization of tumor extracellular pH (mean, 6.96 Â± 0.05; P = .02) using bicarbonate during TACE increased peri- and intratumoral immune cell infiltration (P = .002). Conclusion MRI in a rabbit liver tumor model was used to visualize resistance mechanisms mediated by the immuno-metabolic interplay that inform susceptibility and response to immuno-oncologic therapies, providing a therapeutic strategy to restore immune permissiveness in liver cancer.

Water samples were enzymatically treated followed by digestion with hydrogen peroxide and density separation. MPs were characterized using micro-Raman spectroscopy and were categorized by shape, size and color. Results showed that MP abundance in the influents and effluents of domestic WWTPs was 18-890 and 6-26 nÂ·L(-1), respectively, with the removal efficiency ranging from 35 to 98%. The effluents of industrial WWTPs contained 6-12 nÂ·L(-1) and the levels of MPs in the wastewater of industrial plants, livestock farms and fish ponds were in the range of 8-23, 8-40 and 13-27 nÂ·L(-1), respectively. No significant differences of MP abundance were demonstrated among effluents or wastewater of different sources, indicating they all constitute sources of MP pollution. Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) made up almost 83% of the total MPs. Fragment and film were the most abundant shapes and the majority of MPs were smaller than 500Â Î¼m. Polymer type and shape in different sources did not vary statistically, however, there were slight differences among different sources concerning size and color of MPs.

It has been recently revealed that the gut microbiome plays key functions in the pathological progression of neurological disorders through the production of bacterial endotoxins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, we examined the catalytic effects of LPS on IAPP and AÎ² amyloidoses, and further demonstrated their mitigation with zero-dimensional carbon quantum dots (CQDs). Whereas LPS displayed preferred binding with the N-terminus of IAPP and the central hydrophobic core and C-terminus of AÎ², CQDs exhibited propensities for the amyloidogenic and C-terminus regions of IAPP and the N-terminus of AÎ², accordingly. The inhibitory effect of CQDs was verified by an embryonic zebrafish model exposed to the peptides and LPS, where impaired embryonic hatching was rescued and production of reactive oxygen species in the organism was suppressed by the nanomaterial.

As a result, this study was conducted to evaluate the accumulation of microplastics in marine fish from Thailand and to investigate whether the different foraging mechanisms of fish impact the occurrence of microplastics in their gastrointestinal tract. A total number of 361 demersal fish and 131 pelagic fish were investigated. The collected microplastics were counted according to their shape and color. Their polymer type was identified by FT-IR for the first time in fish from Thailand. Moreover, microplastics ingestion sorted by fish size was noted. The number of ingested microplastics in this study was relatively low compared to other locations. There was no significant difference in the number of microplastics ingested between demersal and pelagic fish (pâ€‰=â€‰0.132).

Fish exploit almost every kind of marine environment, occupy many ecological niches and are an important food source for human populations worldwide. For these reasons, they seem to represent very appropriate biological indicators of microplastic ingestion. UNEP/MAP SPA/RAC (2018) identified the bogue, Boops boops (Linnaeus, 1758), as a possible target species for monitoring microplastic ingestion in fish populations. This study provides the first report of microplastic ingestion by B.Â boops from the Tyrrhenian and the Ligurian Seas (Western Mediterranean Sea). Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to analyse the relationship among biological parameters and environmental factors. A total of 379 bogues were collected in three Italian regions, subject to different anthropogenic pressures (river input, human population, shipping lanes and distance from the coast). Microplastics were detected in the gastrointestinal tract of most individuals (56%) with a mean of 1.8 (Â±0.2) microplastics per individual. Our study further confirms that this species is able to highlight differences in the ingestion of microplastics according to local anthropization, resulting Latium region to be the most polluted. Fish with lower physical condition are more likely to ingest microplastics, suggesting a relationship with the level of local environmental contamination. Finally, the ingestion of microplastics might be influenced by behavioural differences between sexes.

The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of polyethylene microplastic and its association with copper (Cu) in genotoxic, biochemical, and physiological biomarkers of the neotropical teleost Prochilodus lineatus. Fish were exposed for 24 and 96Â h to MP (20Â Î¼gÂ L(-1)) and Cu (10Â Î¼gÂ L(-1)) and MPÂ +Â Cu. The results showed that MP and Cu, both isolated and in combination, promoted DNA damage in erythrocytes (96Â h) and liver cells (24 and 96Â h) indicating that MP and Cu are genotoxic. Fish exposed only to Cu (96Â h) showed a decrease in lipid peroxidation in the liver despite of the decrease in glutathione content, indicating the efficiency of other antioxidant defenses. Brain acetylcholinesterase was inhibited in the animals from all the treatments. Although MP did not influence on Cu accumulation in tissues, decreased plasma Na(+) and Ca(2+) (24Â h) occurred after the exposure to MP and Cu, isolated and combined.

Specifically, the study is to answer four important questions: 1) how do P. promelas consume microplastic particles at different size ranges over time? 2) how long does it take for P. promelas to excrete microplastic particles after consumption? 3) do P. promelas reconsume microplastic particles after excretion? 4) are microplastic consumption and excretion by P. promelas dependent on the body shape? To answer these questions, larval P. promelas were exposed to polyethylene microbeads (PMBs) at two different consumable size ranges of 63-75Â Âµm and 125-150Â Âµm in moderately hard water. The experiments were designed to allow and to not allow fish to reconsume the particles they excreted. Results of the present study showed that P. promelas consumed significant amount of PMBs after 1Â h of exposure to PMBs regardless particle size. The number of consumed PMBs per fish at smaller size range was up to 10 times higher than that at larger size range. When expressing the consumption in Âµg PMBs/fish, this difference was approximately 1.3 times, suggesting the importance of the measurement unit. After consuming, fish excreted PMBs over time and reconsumed excreted PMBs if reconsumption was allowed. Interestingly, it took longer for bent body fish to excrete PMBs than regular straight body fish. Our observation showed that excreted PMBs were likely coated with intestinal fluid that is denser than water, resulting in aggregation and deposition of PMBs. This result suggests that in the natural environment, the consumption and excretion of plastics by fish would enhance the movement of plastics from the water column to the waterbed and make it available for benthic organisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""Only: Mortality was not the endpoint of the present study.

Recently, we have discovered that burning coal generates large quantities of otherwise rare MagnÃ©li phase titanium suboxides from TiO(2) minerals naturally present in coal. These nanoscale MagnÃ©li phases are biologically active without photostimulation and toxic to airway epithelial cells in vitro and to zebrafish in vivo. Here, we sought to determine the clinical and physiological impact of pulmonary exposure to MagnÃ©li phases using mice as mammalian model organisms. Mice were exposed to the most frequently found MagnÃ©li phases, Ti(6)O(11), at 100 parts per million (ppm) via intratracheal administration. Local and systemic titanium concentrations, lung pathology, and changes in airway mechanics were assessed. Additional mechanistic studies were conducted with primary bone marrow derived macrophages. Our results indicate that macrophages are the cell type most impacted by exposure to these nanoscale particles. Following phagocytosis, macrophages fail to properly eliminate MagnÃ©li phases, resulting in increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately apoptosis. In the lungs, these nanoparticles become concentrated in macrophages, resulting in a feedback loop of reactive oxygen species production, cell death, and the initiation of gene expression profiles consistent with lung injury within 6 weeks of exposure. Chronic exposure and accumulation of MagnÃ©li phases ultimately results in significantly reduced lung function impacting airway resistance, compliance, and elastance. Together, these studies demonstrate that MagnÃ©li phases are toxic in the mammalian airway and are likely a significant nanoscale environmental pollutant, especially in geographic regions where coal combustion is a major contributor to atmospheric particulate matter.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,3 - Intervention",31849940,PMC6892980

In this study, we sought to develop nanoparticles (NPs) that could be used to encapsulate PU, thereby extending its in vivo half-life and improving its bioavailability and accumulation in the brain to treat the symptoms of PD. We prepared spherical NPs (88.36 Â± 1.67 nm) from six-armed star-shaped poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (6-s-PLGA) NPs that were used to encapsulate PU (PU-NPs) with 89.52 Â± 1.74% encapsulation efficiency, 42.97 Â± 1.58% drug loading, and a 48 h sustained drug release. NP formation and drug loading were largely mediated by hydrophobic interactions, while changes in the external environment led these NPs to become increasingly hydrophilic, thereby leading to drug release. Relative to PU alone, PU-NPs exhibited significantly improved cellular internalization, permeation, and neuroprotective effects. Upon the basis of FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) of NPs-administered zebrafish, we were able to determine that these NPs were rapidly absorbed into circulation whereupon they were able to access the brain. We further conducted oral PU-NPs administration to rats, revealing significant improvements in PU accumulation within the plasma and brain relative to rats administered free PU. In MPTP-mediated neurotoxicity in mice, we found that PU-NPs treatment improved disease-associated behavioral deficits and depletion of dopamine and its metabolites. These findings indicated that PU-NPs represent a potentially viable approach to enhancing PU oral absorption, thus improving its delivery to the brain wherein it can aid in the treatment of PD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",31638771,

Microplastic concentrations vary significantly across spatiotemporal gradients, however we lack quantitative methodologies to predict species-level responses to differential environmental concentrations. In the present study, we expose a key species, the banded tilapia Tilapia sparrmanii Smith, 1940, to different concentrations of microplastic particles. We apply and develop the functional response approach for quantifications of microplastic uptake by the fish across different environmental densities. Tilapia consumed microplastic even when relatively rare in their environment, and consumption rates related negatively to concentrations supplied, conducive with a saturating Type II (i.e., inversely-density-dependent) functional response. Attack rate (i.e., search efficiency), handling time and maximum feeding rate estimates towards microplastic were estimated, providing key information on feeding behaviour in relation to exposure concentrations. We propose the utility of functional response approaches for predictive quantifications of microplastic uptake rates. In turn, this can better-link laboratory exposure studies to environmental concentrations which are known to cause ecological impact, and provide a means of comparing uptakes among species and across environmental contexts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""length of fish only""], ""Matheus""=>[""Só o basal não diferia na medida morfológica?""]}",31627047,

We recorded a huge concentration of macroplastic debris of domestic origin (up to 5.05 macroplastic items per m(2)) dominated largely by bags (mainly high- and low-density polyethylene), foodwrapper (polypropylene and polystyrene), foam plastics (expanded polystyrene) and beverage bottles (polyethylene terephthalate), particularly downstream from the confluence with an urban stream. This suggests inadequate waste collection, processing and final disposal in the region, which is regrettably recurrent in many cities of the Global South and Argentina in particular. We found an average of 4654 microplastic fragments m(-2) in shoreline sediments of the river, ranging from 131 to 12687 microplastics m(-2). In contrast to other studies from industrialized countries from Europe and North America, secondary microplastics (resulting from comminution of larger particles) were more abundant than primary ones (microbeads to cosmetics or pellets to the industry). This could be explained by differences in consumer habits and industrialization level between societies and economies. Microplastic particles (mostly fibres) were recorded in the digestive tract of 100% of the studied Prochilodus lineatus (commercial species). Contrary to recently published statements by other researchers, our results suggest neither macroplastic nor mesoplastics would serve as surrogate for microplastic items in pollution surveys, suggesting the need to consider all three size categories. The massive plastic pollution found in the ParanÃ¡ River is caused by an inadequate waste management.

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate i) the aging of microplastics polyvinyl chloride (mPVC) in simulated seawater and the changes in physical and chemical properties; ii) the effects of single mPVC (virgin and aged) and copper on microalgae Chlorella vulgaris; and iii) the interaction of aged mPVC and copper and the oxidative stress towards C. vulgaris. In this study, some wrinkles, rough and fractured surface textures can be observed on the aged mPVC, accompanying with increased hydroxyl groups and aromatic carbon-carbon double bond but decreased carbon hydrogen bond. It was found that single virgin or aged mPVC at low concentration (10â€¯mg/L) had significant inhibition on the growth of C. vulgaris but no inhibition at higher concentration (100, 1,000â€¯mg/L), which can be reasonably explained by the aggregation and precipitation of mPVC at high concentration. The aging of mPVC inhibited the growth of C. vulgaris with the maximum growth inhibition ratio (IR) of 35.26% as compared with that of virgin mPVC (IRâ€¯=â€¯28.5%). However, the single copper could significantly inhibit the growth of C. vulgaris and the inhibitory effects increased with concentration (0.2, 0.5, 1.0â€¯mg/L). Furthermore, both the single aged mPVC (10â€¯mg/L) and copper (0.5â€¯mg/L) caused serious cell damage, although the concentration of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the intracellular malonaldehyde (MDA) increased. In contrast to single treatment, the growth of C. vulgaris can be enhanced by the combined group with copper (0.5â€¯mg/L) and aged mPVC (10â€¯mg/L).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",31586885,

It is unclear, however, to what degree, if any, fish select for or against microplastic particles when feeding. It is also unclear whether ingestion of microplastics affects fish condition. To answer these questions, the estimated physical condition and degree of selective feeding on microplastics were determined for juvenile fish collected from the Hudson River. Considering only particles 0.335-5.0â€¯mm, microplastics made up 12% of fish diets but 21% of particles found in the surrounding water column. Relying on Jacob's Modified Electivity (JME) to quantify selectivity in feeding, our results reveal selective feeding on zooplankton and avoidance of microplastics. There was no correlation between condition and degree of selectivity toward any particular food types, including microplastics. Future work needs to consider fish with different feeding strategies and potential bioaccumulation of microplastics in the food web. Fish selectivity of ingestion in regards to microplastics should additionally be tested on wider spatial and temporal scales.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31426240,

Even though health effects including airway diseases are well-known, there is currently a lack of studies investigating how different welding set-ups and conditions affect the toxicity of generated nanoparticles of the welding fume. The aim of this study was to investigate the toxicity of nine types of welding fume particles generated via active gas shielded metal arc welding (GMAW) of chromium-containing stainless steel under different conditions and, furthermore, to correlate the toxicity to the particle characteristics. Toxicological endpoints investigated were generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and activation of ToxTracker reporter cell lines. The results clearly underline that the choice of filler material has a large influence on the toxic potential. Fume particles generated by welding with the tested flux-cored wire (FCW) were found to be more cytotoxic compared to particles generated by welding with solid wire or metal-cored wire (MCW). FCW fume particles were also the most potent in causing ROS and DNA damage and they furthermore activated reporters related to DNA double- strand breaks and p53 signaling. Interestingly, the FCW fume particles were the most soluble in PBS, releasing more chromium in the hexavalent form and manganese compared to the other fumes. These results emphasize the importance of solubility of different metal constituents of the fume particles, rather than the total metal content, for their acute toxic potential.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,3 - Intervention",31418618,

Juveniles were collected in the estuaries of Minho (M-est) and Lima (L-est) Rivers (NW Portugal). One 96 h bioassay with M-est juveniles and another one with L-est juveniles were carried out in laboratory conditions. Each bioassay had 12 treatments: control, 5 Cd concentrations, 1 MPs concentration, and 5 MPs-Cd mixtures. No significant differences in Cd-induced mortality between juveniles from distinct estuaries or between juveniles exposed to Cd alone and those exposed to MPs-Cd mixtures were found. The total 96h LC(10) and LC(50) of Cd alone were 2 mg/L (95% CI: 0-4 mg/L) and 8 mg/L (95% CI: 2-17 mg/L), respectively. Cd alone significantly decreased the post-exposure predatory performance (PEPP) of M-est (â‰¥6 mg/L) and L-est juveniles (â‰¥3 mg/L), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of M-est juveniles (13 mg/L). MPs alone (0.14 mg/L) significantly reduced the PEPP and AChE activity of L-est juveniles but not of M-est juveniles. MPs-Cd mixtures (3-13 mg/L of Cd + 0.14 mg/L of MPs) significantly inhibited the PEPP of juveniles from both estuaries and AChE of L-est estuary juveniles but not of M-est juveniles. Evidences of toxicological interactions, namely antagonism, between MPs and Cd were found. Overall, the results indicate that MPs modulated the sub-lethal toxic effects of Cd in wild P. microps juveniles, especially neurotoxicity. Moreover, the environmental conditions of the natural habitats to which juveniles were exposed during pre-developmental phases influence the sub-lethal toxicity of Cd, MPs, and their mixtures.

The results showed that microplastics are pervasive in surveyed freshwater environments, and a high abundance of microplastics was found in estuaries and inland waters located in populated urban areas. Moreover, many freshwater bivalve and fish have been found to uptake microplastics. Although similar sampling and laboratory processing methods were applied for microplastic research in different aquatic ecosystems, methods of investigation and units reported by different authors should be standardized. The characteristics of the detected microplastics showed that small size (<1â€¯mm), fibers and transparency were the most common features in China's freshwater ecosystems and that PP and PE were the most common types of microplastics. The current situation of microplastic pollution in China is largely caused by inefficient administration and lack of applicable legislation and regulations.

METHODS: The CNS targeting potential of systemically administered nanoemulsions was evaluated by formulating rapamycin containing fish oil nanoemulsions, and testing the combined effect of formulation characteristics such as the circulation half-life and particle size distribution, on CNS delivery of rapamycin containing fish oil nanoemulsions in mice. RESULTS: Results generated with rapamycin nanoemulsions suggested that circulation half-life and particle size distribution did not impact the brain targeting efficiency of rapamycin containing fish oil nanoemulsions. Further, in the absence of any improvement in the systemic exposures of rapamycin, nanoemulsions did not outperform their aqueous counterpart with respect to the extent of CNS drug delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that BBB penetration, which primarily depends on intrinsic drug-related properties, may not be significantly improved following encapsulation of drugs in nanoemulsions.

The microplastic burden of investigated fish was analyzed on the basis of habitat type, location, and a number of abiotic and biotic factors. A particle size distribution analysis of the detected microplastics was carried out. The results showed a relatively low plastic prevalence of 18.8%, with significant differences between rivers (20.6%) and lakes (16.5%). The number of ingested plastic particles ranged between 1 and 4 particles per fish. The majority of abiotic and biotic factors seem to play little or no role in the ingestion of microplastics, suggesting that in most cases uptake is passive or accidental. It is notable that piscivorous fish appeared significantly less burdened, suggesting a low transfer rate and no accumulation in the food web. However, size distribution analysis identified a power law growth fit in particle numbers at the smallest end of the distribution. This carries a worrying implication, that >95% of particles are likely to be smaller than 40â€¯Î¼m and thereby beyond the detection range of this and most other microplastic surveys conducted so far. When the frequency development of small particles is taken into account, the likely microplastic prevalence in the present study increases to 100%, with an average intensity of around 23 predominantly small particles per fish. A striking 70% of those particles would be smaller than 5â€¯Î¼m and therefore eligible for translocation into tissues, with critical implications for fish health and consumer exposure. This raises a question as to whether current estimates of microplastic burden in fishes generally might be overlooking a majority of potential contamination within the critical smaller particle size classes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31280146,

Larvae exposed to Nano-PS did not exhibit developmental defects, while larvae exposed to ERSE (2-5%) showed classic signs of PAH toxicity such as heart malformation and deformities in the jaw, fin, and tail. ERSE (5%) also impaired vascular development in the brain. When coexposed, Nano-PS decreased the developmental deformities and impaired vascular development caused by ERSE. This was strongly correlated to the lower PAH bioaccumulation detected in the coexposed animals (whole larvae, as well as the yolk sac, brain, and heart). Our data suggest that PAHs are sorbing to the surface of the Nano-PS, decreasing the concentration, uptake, and toxicity of free PAHs during the exposure. Such sorption of PAHs increases the agglomeration rate of Nano-PS during the exposure time, potentially decreasing the uptake of Nano-PS and associated PAHs. Despite that, similar induction of EROD activity was detected in animals exposed to ERSE in the presence or not of Nano-PS, suggesting that enough PAHs were accumulated in the organisms to induce cellular defense mechanisms. Nano-PS exposure (single or combined with ERSE) decreased the mitochondrial coupling efficiency and increased NADH production, suggesting an impairment on ATP production accompanied by a compensatory mechanism. Our data indicate that nanoplastics can sorb contaminants and potentially decrease their uptake due to particle agglomeration. Nanoplastics also target and disrupt mitochondrial energy production and act as vectors for the mitochondrial uptake of sorbed contaminants during embryonic and larval stages. Such negative effects of nanoplastics on energy metabolism and efficiency could be detrimental under multiple-stressors exposures and energy-demanding scenarios, which remains to be validated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Included"", ""Querusche""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ?,ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""mortality only?\nbioenergética entra?""]}",31259535,PMC6660138

Small animal imaging models are widely available and practical but insufficiently depict important morphologic detail. In contrary, large animal models are logistically challenging and costly but offer greater imaging quality. In order to combine the advantages of both, we developed an intermediate-sized rabbit animal model for cartilage imaging studies. PROCEDURES: Rabbit mesenchymal stem cells (rMSC) were isolated as primary cultures from the bone marrow of New Zealand white rabbits. rMSC were subsequentially transduced lentivirally with eGFP and magnetically labeled with the iron oxide ferucarbotran. eGFP expression was evaluated by flow cytometry and iron uptake was analyzed by isotope dilution mass spectrometry and Prussian blue staining. Fluorescence microscopy of eGFP-transduced rMSC was performed. Viability and induction of apoptosis were assessed by XTT and caspase-3/-7 measurements. The chondrogenic potential of labeled cells was quantified by glycosaminoglycan contents in TGF-Î²3 induced pellet cultures. Labeled and unlabeled cells underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5Â T before and after differentiation using T1-, T2-, and T2*-weighted pulse sequences. Relaxation rates were calculated. rMSCs were implanted in fibrin clots in osteochondral defects of cadaveric rabbit knees and imaged by 7Â T MRI. T2* maps were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple regression models. RESULTS: Efficiency of lentiviral transduction was greater than 90Â %. Fluorescence signal was dose dependent. Cellular iron uptake was significant for all concentrations (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and dose dependent (3.3-56.5Â pg Fe/cell). Labeled rMSC showed a strong, dose-dependent contrast on all MR pulse sequences and a significant decrease in T2 and T2* relaxation rates. Compared with non-transduced or unlabeled controls, there were no adverse effects on cell viability, rate of apoptosis, or chondrogenic differentiation. MRI of labeled rMSCs in osteochondral defects showed a significant signal of the transplant with additional high-resolution anatomical information. CONCLUSIONS: This intermediate-sized rabbit model and its bifunctional labeling technique allow for improved depiction of anatomic detail for noninvasive in vivo rMSC tracking with MRI and for immunohistological correlation by fluorescence microscopy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",31209781,

Unfortunately, the traditional clinical method using bone cement loaded antibiotics is restricted due to its non-biodegradability and limited release of antibiotics. Hydroxyapatite is a good adsorbent with good biocompatibility, an ideal bone repair material, and can avert the requirement for the secondary surgical procedure of removal. In this study, nano-hydroxyapatite combined with a polyurethane containing 3% silver (Ag/n-HA/PU) was synthesized, and investigated for its efficacy of treating chronic bone infection with bone defects. To clarify its silver ions release characteristics, the concentration of the Ag(+) in the elution was analyzed every day after in vitro deionized water immersion. A chronic osteomyelitis of tibia in rabbit model was established, and 70 New Zealand rabbits were divided into 4 groups, including the blank control group, nano-hydroxyapatite combined with polyurethane (n-HA/PU) implant group, 3% Ag/n-HA/PU group and 10% Ag/n-HA/PU group after debridement. Routine blood tests, radiography, Micro-CT, and histological staining were conducted at 4 days, 3, 6 and 12 weeks post-treatment. The results showed that the released silver from the 3% Ag/n-HA/PU and 10% Ag/n-HA/PU exhibited an initial burst release and followed by a slow controlled release up to 39 days and 42 days respectively. A good repair of bone defects, an appropriate rate of degradation of scaffolds and no significant toxicity were observed in the 3% Ag/n-HA/PU group, indicating the advantages of this novel synthetic scaffold to be a potential option for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis. A novel nano-composite, nano-hydroxyapatite combined with a polyurethane containing 3% silver (Ag/n-HA/PU) provide controlled release of Ag(+), illustrated by its abilities of biodegradation, antimicrobial activity, and favorable repair of bone defects in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",31127361,

PADs cause post-translational protein deimination, resulting in structural and, in some cases, functional changes in target proteins and are also linked to EV biogenesis. This study describes for the first time EVs isolated from cod mucosa. Mucosal EVs were characterised by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and EV-specific surface markers. Cod mucosal EVs were found to carry PAD, complement component C3 and C-reactive proteins. C3 was found to be deiminated in both whole mucus and mucosal EVs, with some differences, and further 6 deiminated immune and cytoskeletal proteins were identified in EVs by LC-MS/MS analysis.

Thus, microplastics are a potential, and debated, source of anthropogenic chemicals for bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Several studies have investigated the role of microplastics as a vector of contaminants to marine organisms via modeling exercises, laboratory experiments, and field studies. Here, we examined relationships among chemical contaminants and microplastics in lanternfish (family Myctophidae), an important link in marine food webs, from the North Pacific Ocean as a case study from the field. We compared the body burden of several chemical groups (bisphenol A [BPA], nonylphenol [4-NP], octylphenol [4n-OP], alkylphenol ethoxylates [APEs], pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], and polybrominated diphenyl ethers [PBDEs]) in fish caught within and outside the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre where plastic is known to accumulate. We also tested whether there was a relationship between chemical concentrations in fish and plastic density at each sampling location. Mean concentrations of common plastic constituents (BPA, 4-NP, 4n-OP, APEs, and total PBDEs) were comparable between myctophids collected within and outside the North Pacific Gyre. Pesticides were higher in lanternfish caught outside the gyre and were associated with lower plastic density. Total PCBs were also higher in fish outside the gyre. In contrast, lower chlorinated PCB congeners were higher in fish residing in the accumulation zone and were correlated with higher plastic density. This finding is consistent with other studies demonstrating an association between lower chlorinated PCBs and plastics in biota and suggests that microplastic may be a transport mechanism for some chemicals in nature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31091632,

We tested two types of AgNPs with different synthesis methodologies and size diameters: ARGOVIT (35Â nm) and UTSA (1-3Â nm) nanoparticles. Damage to the parasite tegument was observed by scanning electron microscopy. UTSA AgNPs were more effective than ARGOVIT; in both cases, there was a concentration-dependent effect. A concentration of 36Â Î¼g/L UTSA AgNPs for 1Â h was 100% effective against eggs and adult parasites, causing swelling, loss of corrugations, and disruption of the parasite's tegument. This is an interesting result considering that monogenean eggs are typically tolerant to antiparasite drugs and chemical agents. To the best of our knowledge, no previous reports have assessed the effect of AgNPs on any metazoan parasites of fish.

This triggers concern about potential economic impacts and the risks of dietary exposure, especially for coastal communities. However, data regarding the levels of microplastics in coastal seafood and their toxicological effects are still limited. Accordingly, the dietary risk is still poorly explored. This review summarizes and discusses recent scientific findings on (i) the presence of microplastics in coastal waters, (ii) the occurrence of microplastics in coastal seafood and the likelihood of trophic transfer, and (iii) the effects of microplastics on coastal fish and shellfish species. Human toxicity data are also reviewed, but the risks for human health are difficult to determine due to limited data. Based on available worldwide data, the estimation of microplastics intake through seafood consumption shows a huge variation. Additionally, a lack of standardized analytical methods complicates the comparison of results between studies and therefore seriously affects the reliability of risk assessments. It is concluded that more exposure and toxicity data are needed properly to assess human health risks of microplastics in coastal seafood, and the lack of data currently impede the derivation of a risk-based food safety standard.

We hypothesize that studies that do not control for the fluorescent dye leachate and/or cellular autofluorescence are inconclusive and can be misinterpreted. Our goal was to analyse previous investigations critically and conduct further research to determine if fluorescent-labelled polystyrene NPs (nanoPS) can provide conclusive evidence of absorption and internal accumulation of NPs. We exposed zebrafish embryos and larvae to NPs (500 and 1000â€¯nm) labelled with a green or an orange fluorescent dye, to solutions resulting from nanoPS dialysis, and to Nile-Red (a fluorescent dye used as a positive control). Previous studies have claimed that NPs cross epithelia without accounting for dye leachates and/or cellular autofluorescence. Our results demonstrate that commercial fluorescent-labelled nanoPS can leach their fluorophores, and the fluorophore alone can accumulate within internal tissues of zebrafish larvae. We further observed green autofluorescence in fish larvae not exposed to any particles. Previous claims of NP absorption based on observations of fluorescence in zebrafish tissues should thus be considered inconclusive. Although the addition of purification steps and inclusion of controls for leaching of dyes are methodological improvements, the use of fluorescent nanoPS should not be considered to provide absolute conclusive evidence of particle absorption.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome",30921723,

In particular, the complex, bilateral interactions between the host innate immune system and the microbiota are crucial in maintaining whole body homeostasis. The development of nanotechnology is raising concern on the potential impact of nanoparticles-NPs on human and environmental health. Titanium dioxide-nTiO(2), one of the most widely NP in use, has been shown to affect the gut microbiota of mammals and fish, as well as to potentially alter microbial communities. In the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis, nTiO(2) has been previously shown to interact with hemolymph components, thus resulting in immunomodulation. However, no information is available on the possible impact of NPs on the microbiome of marine organisms. Bivalves host high microbial abundance and diversity, and alteration of their microbiota, in both tissues and hemolymph, in response to stressful conditions has been linked to a compromised health status and susceptibility to diseases. In this work, the effects of nTiO(2) exposure (100â€¯Î¼g/L, 4â€¯days) on Mytilus hemolymph microbiota were investigated by 16S rRNA gene-based profiling. Immune parameters were also evaluated. Although hemolymph microbiota of control and nTiO(2)-treated mussels revealed a similar core composition, nTiO(2) exposure affected the abundance of different genera, with decreases in some (e.g. Shewanella, Kistimonas, Vibrio) and increases in others (e.g. Stenotrophomonas).

CeO(2)-NPs, in particular, have demonstrated extreme antioxidant activity, but their in vivo toxicity is still unknown. This work intended to characterize the chronic toxicity (28 days) of three different ecologically relevant concentrations (0.1, 0.01, and 0.001â€‰Î¼g/L) of CeO(2)-NPs in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), in terms of biomarkers of oxidative stress [activity of the enzymes glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and catalase (CAT)] and neurotoxicity [activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE)], as well as histological alterations in liver and gills. In the hereby study, GSTs activity was increased in gills of fish exposed to the highest CeO(2)-NPs level. Moreover, a potential anti-oxidant response was also reported, with a significant increase of CAT activity observed in livers of the same fish. AChE, however, was not significantly altered in fish eyes. Individuals exposed to CeO(2)-NPs also presented marked changes in the gills (e.g. epithelial lifting, intercellular edema, lamellar hypertrophy and hyperplasia, secondary lamella fusion and aneurysms) and liver (e.g. hepatocyte vacuolization, pyknotic nucleus, enlargement of sinusoids and hyperemia). The semi-quantitative analysis (organs pathological index) also showed the establishment of a dose-effect relationship. Further studies about the ecotoxicological effects of the CeO(2)-NPs have yet to be conducted, considering their properties, as the aggregation chemistry and the ratio of its redox state, which may affect their availability to the organism and their toxicity in the environment and biota.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",30870693,

Exposure to a high concentration of 5 MP particles per mL (5 MPÂ mL(-1)) for 3, 5 and 8Â days did not alter their foraging activity nor their susceptibility to predation.

Hypertension in PKD is a ciliopathy, an abnormal function and/or structure of primary cilia. Primary cilia are cellular organelles with chemo and mechanosensory roles. In the present studies, we designed a cilia-targeted (CT) delivery system to deliver fenoldopam specifically to the primary cilia. We devised the iron oxide nanoparticle (NP)-based technology for ciliotherapy. Live imaging confirmed that the CT-Fe(2)O(3)-NPs specifically targeted primary cilia in cultured cells in vitro and vascular endothelia in vivo. Importantly, the CT-Fe(2)O(3)-NPs enabled the remote control of the movement and function of a cilium with an external magnetic field, making the nonmotile cilium exhibit passive movement. The ciliopathic hearts displayed hypertrophy with compromised functions in left ventricle pressure, stroke volume, ejection fraction, and overall cardiac output because of prolonged hypertension. The CT-Fe(2)O(3)-NPs significantly improved cardiac function in the ciliopathic hypertensive models, in which the hearts also exhibited arrhythmia, which was corrected with the CT-Fe(2)O(3)-NPs. Intraciliary and cytosolic Ca(2+) were increased when cilia were induced with fluid flow or magnetic field, and this served as a cilia-dependent mechanism of the CT-Fe(2)O(3)-NPs. Fenoldopam-alone caused an immediate decrease in blood pressure, followed by reflex tachycardia. Pharmacological delivery profiles confirmed that the CT-Fe(2)O(3)-NPs were a superior delivery system for targeting cilia more specifically, efficiently, and effectively than fenoldopam-alone. The CT-Fe(2)O(3)-NPs altered the mechanical properties of nonmotile cilia, and these nano-biomaterials had enormous clinical potential for ciliotherapy. Our studies further indicated that ciliotherapy provides a possibility toward personalized medicine in ciliopathy patients.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,3 - Intervention",30860808,PMC7899146

For this we used the well-known potential of calcium phosphate in bone contact and supplemented it with DNA for the in-situ transfection of BMP-7 and VEGF-A in a critical-size bone defect. 24 New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into two groups: One group with BMP-7- and VEGF-A-encoding DNA on calcium phosphate nanoparticles and a control group with calcium phosphate nanoparticles only. The bone defect was created at the proximal medial tibia and filled with the DNA-loaded calcium phosphate paste. As control, a bone defect was filled with the calcium phosphate paste without DNA. The proximal tibia was investigated 2, 4 and 12 weeks after the operation. A histomorphological analysis of the dynamic bone parameters was carried out with the Osteomeasure system. The animals treated with the DNA-loaded calcium phosphate showed a statistically significantly increased bone volume per total volume after 4 weeks in comparison to the control group. Additionally, a statistically significant increase of the trabecular number and the number of osteoblasts per tissue area were observed. These results were confirmed by radiological analysis. The DNA-loaded bone paste led to a significantly faster healing of the critical-size bone defect in the rabbit model after 4 weeks. After 12 weeks, all defects had equally healed in both groups. No difference in the quality of the new bone was found. The injectable DNA-loaded calcium phosphate paste led to a faster and more sustained bone healing and induced an accelerated bone formation after 4 weeks. The material was well integrated into the bone defect and new bone was formed on its surface. The calcium phosphate paste without DNA led to a regular healing of the critical-size bone defect, but the healing was slower than the DNA-loaded paste. Thus, the in-situ transfection with BMP-7 and VEGF-A significantly improved the potential of calcium phosphate as pasty bone substitution material.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",30671652,

Although mariculture has become an essential source of seafood worldwide, the content of microplastics in the mariculture zone has received less scrutiny than in the wild environment. The Maowei Sea is a semi-closed bay that is rich in fishery resources. The specific levels of microplastics in the Maowei Sea and its fishery products remain undetermined. In this paper, we detail the distributions and characteristics of microplastics in the aquaculture water and biota of the Maowei Sea. Microplastics were detected in the range of 1.2-10.1â€¯particles/L in Maowei Sea surface water, with high microplastic content in estuarine oyster nursery (10.1â€¯particles/L) and Qinzhou harbor (8.8-9.5 particles/L) sites. In water samples from the three inflowing rivers, the abundances ranged from 2.9 to 4.5â€¯particles/L, which is comparable to that in Maowei Sea surface water. Of 66 collected fish belonging to 12 species, microplastics were observed in all of the gastrointestinal tracts (GITs) and in the gills of 40 individuals. In the GIT and gill tests, the abundances of microplastics ranged from 2.0 to 14.0 and from 0.0 to 8.5 particles/individual, respectively. The enhanced particles/individual figures in the GIT relative to the gill are particularly noteworthy. Demersal species showed significantly higher abundances of microplastics than pelagic species (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05). Microplastics were also detected in the soft tissues of all oyster samples, with abundances ranging from 3.2 to 8.6 particles/individual. The microplastic composition was dominated by rayon and polyester and tended to be white in color and fibrous in shape. Altogether, these results correspond to high levels of microplastics in the Maowei Sea. As the study region is a mariculture bay, the observed microplastics contamination in its fishery products presents a route for human exposure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 35 New Zealand White rabbits were used in a bilateral femoral intercondylar fracture model and randomly divided into two groups. n-CDHA/PAA screws were used in the experimental group, and medical metal screws were used in the control group. The fracture condition, range of motion, and the screw push-out strength were assessed, and an arthroscopic examination of knee joint was performed at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. The biodegradation of the n-CDHA/PAA screws in vivo was tested through weighing, and changes in screw structure were assessed by X-ray diffraction at 12 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: The general situation of all animals was good and showed no incision infection and dehiscence after surgery. X-ray scanning showed that significant callus growth was present in both groups at 4 weeks after surgery, and there was no significant difference (P>0.05) in the Lane-Sandhu score between the experimental and control groups at all time points after surgery. There were no statistically significant differences (P>0.05) in the range of motion and Oswestry Arthroscopy Score of arthroscopic examination of the knee joints between the two groups. The screw push-out strength of the control group was stronger than that of the experimental group at 4 weeks after surgery (P<0.05), but after that, there was no significant difference between the groups (P>0.05). The degradation tests showed that the n-CDHA/PAA screws degraded gradually after implantation, and the weight loss rate was approximately 16% at 12 weeks after surgery. The X-ray diffraction results showed that the crystal structure of the outer surface of the n-CDHA/PAA screw has changed at 12 weeks after surgery. CONCLUSION: The n-CDHA/PAA screw is an effective and safe implant as a potential internal fixation device for an intercondylar fracture of the femur, and its internal fixation effect was similar to that of medical metal screw.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",30425478,PMC6201990

Using keratin-like IFs obtained from slime fibers from the invertebrate Atlantic hagfish ( Myxine glutinosa), films were produced by drop-casting and coagulation on the surface of a MgCl(2) buffer. Drop-casting produced self-supporting, smooth, and dense films rich in Î²-sheets (61%), whereas coagulation formed thin, porous films with a nanorough surface and a lower Î²-sheet content (51%). The films hydrated and swelled immediately when immersed in water and did not dissolve. X-ray diffraction showed that the Î²-crystallites remained stable upon hydration, that swelling presumably happens in the amorphous C-terminal tail-domains of the IFs, and that high salt conditions caused a denser network mesh size, suggesting polyelectrolyte behavior. Hydration resulted in a roughly 1000-fold decrease in apparent Young's modulus from 10(9) to 10(6) Pa as revealed by atomic force microscopy nanoindentation. Nanoindentation-based power-law rheology and stress-relaxation measurements indicated viscoelasticity and a soft-solid hydrogel character for hydrated films, where roughly 80% of energy is elastically stored and 20% is dissipated. By pulling coagulation films from the buffer interface, macroscopic fibers with highly aligned IF Î²-crystals similar to natural hagfish fibers were produced. We propose that viscoelasticity and strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the buffer interface are crucial for the production of such long biomimetic fibers with aligned Î²-sheets. This study demonstrates that hagfish fiber IFs can be reconstituted into functional biomimetic materials that are stiff when dry and retain the ability to hydrate to become soft and viscoelastic when in water.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30371056,

PS-MPs were found to enhance the bioaccumulation of ROX in fish tissues compared to ROX-alone exposure. In the treatment of PS-MPs (100â€¯Î¼gâ€¯L(-1)) combined with ROX (50â€¯Î¼gâ€¯L(-1)), the highest concentrations of ROX reached 39,672.9â€¯Â±â€¯6311.4, 1767.9â€¯Â±â€¯277.8, 2907.5â€¯Â±â€¯225.0, and 4307.1â€¯Â±â€¯186.5â€¯Î¼gâ€¯kg(-1) in gut, gills, brain, and liver, respectively. Furthermore, compared to the ROX alone, the neurotoxicity caused by ROX was alleviated due to the presence of MPs after 14â€¯d of exposure.

Compared with ROX alone, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased significantly, and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents decreased in the co-exposure treatments, showing that oxidative damage in situations of co-exposure to MPs and ROX was mitigated in fish livers after 14â€¯d of exposure.

In order to evaluate the extent of microplastic pollution on the sandy beaches (25 locations) along Tamil Nadu coast (1076â€¯km), India, microplastic debris were quantified and categorized into four different size classes. The beaches were classified according to potential sources of pollution i.e. riverine, tourism and fisheries. Beach samples collected from the high tide line contained significantly higher abundance of microplastic than at the low tide line. Beaches adjacent to rivers exhibited relatively higher microplastic abundance compared to those influenced by tourism and fishing activities. Out of the total detected debris, plastic fragments were the maximum (47-50%), followed by line/fibres (24-27%) and foam (10-19%) materials. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed that polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene were the main types of microplastics present in these beaches. Gut content analysis of commercially important fishes, collected from the coastal waters, revealed microplastics ingestion in 10.1% of fishes. The results indicate that microplastics accumulation in the coastal environment, especially close to the river mouths, may be a serious concern, due to its ability to enter into the marine food web and highlights the necessity of microplastics screening from estuarine, coastal waters and other potential sources.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30248861,

Animals were exposed to three concentrations of MPs (0, 50 or 500â€¯Î¼gâ€¯L(-1)) crossed with two levels of Cd (0 or 50â€¯Î¼gâ€¯L(-1)) for 30 days. Our findings showed that MPs and Cd had no adverse effects on growth and survival. Under exposure to Cd, however, accumulation of Cd in the body of fish decreased with increasing MP concentrations as supported by a reduced metallothionein content. The activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase increased with MPs but decreased with Cd. MPs, Cd or the mixture increased catalase activity, despite an antagonistic interaction between the two stressors. Glutathione levels increased when exposed to high MP concentrations but decreased when co-exposed to Cd. Malondialdehyde content was only influenced by MPs and increased with elevated MPs. MPs or Cd alone did not increase protein carboxyl content but showed a synergistic effect and increased content. MPs or Cd alone showed no effect on lysozyme activity but had a synergistic effect and activated activity. Activities of both acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase were enhanced by MPs, Cd or their mixture, although there was an antagonistic interaction between the two stressors. In contrast, MPs, Cd or their mixture decreased complement 3 content, despite an antagonistic interaction between the two stressors. Collectively, this study suggests that exposure to Cd led to reduced Cd accumulation in the presence of MPs. Nevertheless, co-exposure could induce severe oxidative stress and stimulate innate immunity in the juvenile S.Â aequifasciatus.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Included"", ""Querusche""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""survival rate only""]}",30216878,

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the ingestion of APs and the possible occurrence of APs in the liver and muscle of a freshwater fish, Squalius cephalus, from the Parisian conurbation. After isolation, the particles were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy. In sixty stomachs, eighteen APs were found, half of which were plastics and the other half were dyed particles. Twenty-five percent of sampled individuals had ingested at least one AP. The mean length of the APs was 2.41â€¯mm. No significant difference was found between the sites upstream and downstream of Paris. Additionally, 5% of sampled livers contained one or more APs, which were characterized as microplastics (MPs). No APs were found in the muscle tissue. The majority of APs isolated from stomach contents were fibers, which is similar to the findings of a previous river contamination study. This highlights that fish could be more exposed to fibers than previously thought and that more studies on the impacts of fiber ingestion are required. Despite their low occurrence, MPs are reported, for the first time, in the liver of a wild freshwater fish species. While the pathways and impacts are still unknown, MPs also occur in liver of marine mollusks and fish. Physiological in vitro studies are needed to better evaluate the impacts of such phenomena.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30189542,

Herein, novel fluorescent nanoparticles are introduced based on an inherently fluorescent polypyrazoline (PPy) core and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) shell, which address all aforementioned challenges. Synthesis of the PPy-PEG amphiphilic block copolymer by phototriggered step-growth polymerization is investigated by NMR spectroscopy, size-exclusion chromatography, and mass spectrometry. The corresponding nanoparticles are characterized for their luminescent properties and hydrodynamic size in various aqueous environments (e.g., cell culture media). PPy nanoparticles particularly exhibit a large Stokes shift (Î”Î» = 160 nm or Î”Î½ > 7000 cm(-1) ) with visible light excitation and strong colloidal stability. While clearance by macrophages and endothelial cells is minimal, PPy displays good biocompatibility. Finally, PPy nanoparticles prove to be long circulating when injected in zebrafish embryos, as observed by in vivo time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. In summary, PPy nanoparticles are highly promising to be further developed as fluorescent nanodelivery systems with low toxicity and exquisite retention in the blood stream.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Included"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ?,ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention | USER-NOTES: {""Ana""=>[""Moreover, we observed no acute morphological and behavioral abnormalities in embryos treated with any of the NPs.""], ""Querusche""=>[""Não consegui determinar se a partícula utilizada é plástico, por isso considero que deva ser excluído""]}",30079605,

Since 2004, the world has made as much plastic as it did in the previous half century, and it has been reckoned that the total mass of virgin plastics ever made amounts to 8.3 billion tonnes, mainly derived from natural gas and crude oil, used as chemical feedstocks and fuel sources. Between 1950 and 2015, a total of 6.3 billion tonnes of primary and secondary (recycled) plastic waste was generated, of which around 9% has been recycled, and 12% incinerated, with the remaining 79% either being stored in landfills or having been released directly into the natural environment. In 2015, 407 million tonnes (Mt) of plastic was produced, of which 164 Mt was consumed by packaging (36% of the total). Although quoted values vary, packaging probably accounts for around one third of all plastics used, of which approximately 40% goes to landfill, while 32% escapes the collection system. It has been deduced that around 9 Mt of plastic entered the oceans in 2010, as a result of mismanaged waste, along with up to 0.5 Mt each of microplastics from washing synthetic textiles, and from the abrasion of tyres on road surfaces. However, the amount of plastics actually measured in the oceans represents less than 1% of the (at least) 150 Mt reckoned to have been released into the oceans over time. Plastic accounts for around 10% by mass of municipal waste, but up to 85% of marine debris items - most of which arrive from land-based sources. Geographically, the five heaviest plastic polluters are P. R. China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, which between them contribute 56% of global plastic waste. Larger, primary plastic items can undergo progressive fragmentation to yield a greater number of increasingly smaller 'secondary' microplastic particles, thus increasing the overall surface area of the plastic material, which enhances its ability to absorb, and concentrate, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), with the potential to transfer them to the tissues of animals that ingest the microplastic particles, particularly in marine environments. Although fears that such microparticles and their toxins may be passed via food webs to humans are not as yet substantiated, the direct ingestion of microplastics by humans via drinking water is a distinct possibility - since 92% of samples taken in the USA and 72% in Europe showed their presence - although any consequent health effects are as yet unclear. Foodstuffs may also become contaminated by microplastics from the air, although any consequent health effects are also unknown. In regard to such airborne sources, it is noteworthy that small plastic particles have been found in human lung tissue, which might prove an adverse health issue under given circumstances. It is also very striking that microplastics have been detected in mountain soils in Switzerland, which are most likely windborne in origin. Arctic ice core samples too have revealed the presence of microplastics, which were most likely carried on ocean currents from the Pacific garbage patch, and from local pollution from shipping and fishing. Thus, sea ice traps large amounts of microplastics and transports them across the Arctic Ocean, but these particles will be released into the global environment when the ice melts, particularly under the influence of a rising mean global temperature. While there is a growing emphasis toward the substitution of petrochemically derived plastics by bioplastics, controversy has arisen in regard to how biodegradable the latter actually are in the open environment, and they presently only account for 0.5% of the total mass of plastics manufactured globally. Since the majority of bioplastics are made from sugar and starch materials, to expand their use significantly raises the prospect of competition between growing crops to supply food or plastics, similarly to the diversion of food crops for the manufacture of primary biofuels. The use of oxo-plastics, which contain additives that assist the material to degrade, is also a matter of concern, since it is claimed that they merely fragment and add to the environmental burden of microplastics; hence, the European Union has moved to restrict their use. Since 6% of the current global oil (including natural gas liquids, NGLs) production is used to manufacture plastic commodities - predicted to rise to 20% by 2050 - the current approaches for the manufacture and use of plastics (including their end-use) demand immediate revision. More extensive collection and recycling of plastic items at the end of their life, for re-use in new production, to offset the use of virgin plastic, is a critical aspect both for reducing the amount of plastic waste entering the environment, and in improving the efficiency of fossil resource use. This is central to the ideology underpinning the circular economy, which has common elements with permaculture, the latter being a regenerative design system based on 'nature as teacher', which could help optimise the use of resources in town and city environments, while minimising and repurposing 'waste'. Thus, food might be produced more on the local than the global scale, with smaller inputs of fuels (including transportation fuels for importing and distributing food), water and fertilisers, and with a marked reduction in the use of plastic packaging. Such an approach, adopted by billions of individuals, could prove of immense significance in ensuring future food security, and in reducing waste and pollution - of all kinds.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30025551,

The retention of virgin microplastics in the gastrointestinal tract was fairly low, indicating effective elimination of microplastics from the body of the fish and no significant accumulation after successive meals. Therefore, both the short- and the long-term retention potential of microplastics in the gastrointestinal tract of fish is close to zero. However, some large particles remained trapped in the liver, and 5.3% of all the livers analyzed contained at least one microplastic particle.

In both exposure scenarios, transfer of BaP could be visualized with fluorescence microscopy: A prominent BaP signal was visible both in gill filaments and arches after 6 and 24â€¯h incubation and in zebrafish embryos after exposure to BaP-spiked microplastics. Furthermore, the gill EROD (Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase) assay showed a clear trend to CYP 1A (Cytochrom P450 1 A) induction via exposure to BaP-spiked microplastics. However, BaP from spiked microplastics did not reach sufficiently high concentrations to be able to induce morphological effects in the fish embryo toxicity test (FET). In contrast, control exposure to waterborne BaP did induce effects in the FET. As a conclusion, microplastics can also transfer POPs not only via ingestion, but also by simple attachment to epithelia or via the water column. However, further studies are needed to clarify if these interactions are of environmental concern relative to waterborne exposure to toxic substances.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Included"", ""Querusche""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | USER-NOTES: {""Ana""=>[""Tem teste de toxicidade e microplastico virgem... não tá claro o resultado no texto, mas diz que foi feito... pedir pros autores...""], ""Querusche""=>[""EC50\nsurvival\nonly""]}",29751397,

In this study we assess the effect of microplastic exposure on juveniles of a planktivorous fish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus), a species that is widespread and abundant on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Under five different plastic concentration treatments, with plastics the same size as the natural food particles (mean 2mm diameter), there was no significant effect of plastic exposure on fish growth, body condition or behaviour. The amount of plastics found in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract was low, with a range of one to eight particles remaining in the gut of individual fish at the end of a 6-week plastic-exposure period, suggesting that these fish are able to detect and avoid ingesting microplastics in this size range. However, in a second experiment the number of plastics in the GI tract vastly increased when plastic particle size was reduced to approximately one quarter the size of the food particles, with a maximum of 2102 small (< 300Î¼m diameter) particles present in the gut of individual fish after a 1-week plastic exposure period. Under conditions where food was replaced by plastic, there was a negative effect on the growth and body condition of the fish. These results suggest plastics could become more of a problem as they break up into smaller size classes, and that environmental changes that lead to a decrease in plankton concentrations combined with microplastic presence is likely have a greater influence on fish populations than microplastic presence alone.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Included"", ""Querusche""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ?,ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""plastic from 1-2mm"", ""virgin plastic with biofilm is still virgin?""]}",29494635,PMC5832226

A homogenized fish sample was spiked with 100Â nm polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs) (1.3Â mg/g fish). Two sample preparation strategies were tested: acid digestion and enzymatic digestion with proteinase K. Both procedures were found suitable for degradation of the organic matrix. However, acid digestion resulted in large PSNPs aggregates/agglomerates (>â€‰1Â Î¼m). The presence of large particulates was not observed after enzymatic digestion, and consequently it was chosen as a sample preparation method. The results demonstrated that it was possible to use AF4 for separating the PSNPs from the digested fish and to determine their size by MALS. The PSNPs could be easily detected by following their light scattering (LS) signal with a limit of detection of 52Â Î¼g/g fish. The AF4-MALS method could also be exploited for another type of nanoplastics in solution, namely polyethylene (PE). However, it was not possible to detect the PE particles in fish, due to the presence of an elevated LS background. Our results demonstrate that an analytical method developed for a certain type of nanoplastics may not be directly applicable to other types of nanoplastics and may require further adjustment.

Most studies on microplastic ingestion are short-term investigations and little is currently known about how this potential threat has developed over the last decades where global plastic production has increased exponentially. Here we present the first long-term study on microplastic in the marine environment, covering three decades from 1987 to 2015, based on a unique sample set originally collected and conserved for food web studies. We investigated the microplastic concentration in plankton samples and in digestive tracts of two economically and ecologically important planktivorous forage fish species, Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) and European sprat (Sprattus sprattus), in the Baltic Sea, an ecosystem which is under high anthropogenic pressure and has undergone considerable changes over the past decades. Surprisingly, neither the concentration of microplastic in the plankton samples nor in the digestive tracts changed significantly over the investigated time period. Average microplastic concentration in the plankton samples was 0.21Â±0.15particlesm(-3). Of 814 fish examined, 20% contained plastic particles, of which 95% were characterized as microplastic (<5mm) and of these 93% were fibres. There were no significant differences in the plastic content between species, locations, or time of day the fish were caught. However, fish size and microplastic in the digestive tracts were positively correlated, and the fish contained more plastic during summer than during spring, which may be explained by increased food uptake with size and seasonal differences in feeding activity. This study highlights that even though microplastic has been present in the Baltic environment and the digestive tracts of fishes for decades, the levels have not changed in this period.

The goal was to access specific molecular information at the individual particle level in order to identify polymer debris in the natural environment. The identification process was aided by a laboratory generated automated fluorescence removal algorithm. Pacific Ocean trawl samples of plastic debris associated with fish collection sites were analyzed to determine the types of polymers commonly present. Subsequently, stomach contents of fish from these locations were analyzed for ingested polymer debris. Extraction of polymer debris from fish stomach using KOH versus ultrapure water were evaluated to determine the optimal method of extraction. Pulsed ultrasonic extraction in ultrapure water was determined to be the method of choice for extraction with minimal chemical intrusion. The Pacific Ocean trawl samples yielded primarily polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) particles >1Â mm, PE being the most prevalent type. Additional microplastic residues (1Â mm - 10Â Î¼m) extracted by filtration, included a polystyrene (PS) particle in addition to PE and PP. Flame retardant, deca-BDE was tentatively identified on some of the PP trawl particles. Polymer residues were also extracted from the stomachs of Atlantic and Pacific Ocean fish. Two types of polymer related debris were identified in the Atlantic Ocean fish: (1) polymer fragments and (2) fragments with combined polymer and fatty acid signatures. In terms of polymer fragments, only PE and PP were detected in the fish stomachs from both locations. A variety of particles were extracted from oceanic fish as potential plastic pieces based on optical examination. However, subsequent RMS examination identified them as various non-plastic fragments, highlighting the importance of chemical analysis in distinguishing between polymer and non-polymer residues.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",29037491,

This diversity of experimental methods has led to conflicting results and difficulties in comparing studies. The objective of the present study was to evaluate intravenous injection of unfunctionalized CNMs in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), as a means of delivering a known internal dose, on tissue biochemistry and histopathological lesions; then, subsequently, to compare the results with our previous work on aqueous and dietary exposures of rainbow trout to CNMs. Rainbow trout were injected in the caudal vein with corn oil dispersions of 200Â Î¼g (approximately 1Â Î¼gÂ g(-1)) of either the fullerene C(60), single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), or amorphous carbon black. After 96Â h, injected fish were euthanized and tissue samples collected for biochemistry and histology. Histological examination of the kidney of fish injected intravenously indicated the presence of black material consistent with the injected carbon treatments. However, there were no additional lesions associated with CNM exposure compared to controls. There were also no significant changes in haematology, or ionoregulatory disturbance in blood plasma among the intravenously injected fish. Significant elevation in lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances TBARS) was detected only in kidney and spleen of fish injected with SWCNTs, but not the other carbon treatments. The elevated TBARS following injection contrasted with CNMs delivered via aqueous or dietary routes in our previous studies, suggesting that the latter exposure routes may not lead to absorption and toxicity in the internal tissues. Comparison of the effects of injected CNMs with aqueous and dietary CNMs exposures indicates that these materials are of minimal environmentally-relevant toxicity in rainbow trout.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",28941714,

A small increase in the activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) of M. surmuletus was detected which could be suggesting an induction of the detoxification systems but these findings should be tested in laboratory conditions under a controlled diet and known concentration of microplastics. Fish from trammel fisheries, operating closer to land and targeting larger individuals, showed higher mean ingestion values than fish from trawling fisheries, and were related to body size, as microplastics ingested increased with total fish length. Consequently, ingestion values of microplastics were not related to sampling distance from land giving further evidence of the ubiquity of microplastics in the marine environment.

In addition, we discuss the toxicities of these amyloid proteins based on their self-assembly as well as their interactions with membranes, metal ions, small molecules and engineered nanoparticles. Through this presentation we show the remarkable similarities and differences in the structural transitions of the amyloid proteins through primary and secondary nucleation, the common evolution from disordered monomers to alpha-helices and then to Î²-sheets when the proteins encounter the cell membrane, and, the consensus (with a few exceptions) that off-pathway oligomers, rather than amyloid fibrils, are the toxic species regardless of the pathogenic protein sequence or physicochemical properties. In addition, we highlight the crucial role of molecular self-assembly in eliciting the biological and pathological consequences of the amyloid proteins within the context of their cellular environments and their spreading between cells and organs.

This commentary summarizes recent discoveries regarding the potential negative effects of micro- and nanoplastic ingestion by fish. Analysis shows that the occurrence of microplastics in the gastrointestinal tract of fish is ephemeral, with low accumulation potential in the gastrointestinal tract, although translocation to the liver may occur. Nevertheless, the total load of micro- and nanoplastics that will pass through the gastrointestinal tract of a fish in its lifetime is likely high and will keep increasing in the future. This may pose a risk because there is evidence that micro- and nanoplastic ingestion can interfere with fish health.

Further aspects of calibration, recoveries, and potential matrix effects are discussed. The method is exemplarily applied on selected fish samples after an enzymatic-chemically pretreatment.

Fluorescence was also detected in the head region of the fish after aqueous exposure to polystyrene NPs. This was not observed for Au NPs. Aqueous exposure to Au NPs resulted in increased relative swimming distance, while no effect was observed for other exposures.

METHODS: Morphology of the samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy, and the pH and ion release analysis were also assessed. Biocompatibility of materials' eluates (24-hour, 7-day, and 21-day) was conducted by using MTT test. Twelve New Zealand white rabbits were used for intraosseous implantation. Four calvarial defects per animal were created and filled with freshly prepared investigated materials. RESULTS: Samples mostly consisted of agglomerates built up from nanoparticles, preferably spherical and rod-like. There was no significant difference among pH values of materials' eluates after 24Â hours (PÂ >Â .05). The amount of calcium and aluminum ion release decreased, whereas the amount of magnesium and bismuth (ALBO-MPCA(1), MTA(+)) and barium (ALBO-MPCA(2)) increased during 21-day period. The metabolic activity of cells increased after the extraction time, except in case of undiluted elutes of ALBO-MPCA(2) and ALBO-MPCA(1) (21-day). Histologic analysis of the samples revealed newly formed bone tissue with moderate inflammation for all investigated materials, which subsided during 90-day period to mild. Both MTA(+) and ALBO-MPCA(1) were in direct contact with the newly formed bone tissue. After 90 days, statistically significant difference in hard tissue formation was observed in comparison of MTA(+) and ALBO-MPCA(1) with control group (PÂ <Â .05). CONCLUSIONS: Experimental materials ALBO-MPCA(1) and ALBO-MPCA(2) possess both biocompatibility and bioactivity.

The electron microscopy images showed the nanometric size and spherical shape. The assay in soil showed that GML has a high toxicity while the GML nanocapsules showed decreased toxic effects. Nanostructuration also protected the Rhamdia quelen against the toxic effects of GML. Concluding, the formulation shows positive results and is useful to predict the success of development besides not damaging the soil.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""Survival only""]}",28110048,

Amino-functionalized QDs cluster, interact with cells, and clear more rapidly than carboxy-functionalized QDs in vivo, highlighting charge influences. QDs show stronger accumulation in slow-flowing, small caliber venous vessels than in fast-flowing high caliber arterial vessels. Parallel-plate flow experiments with HUVEC support these findings, showing reduced QD-EC association with increasing flow.

In the present study, we investigated plastic pollution in 21 species of sea fish and 6 species of freshwater fish from China. All of the species were found to ingest micro- or mesoplastics.

The average abundance of mesoplastics varied from 0.2 to 3.0 items by individual and 0.1-3.9 items by gram. Microplastics were abundant in 26 species, accounting for 55.9-92.3% of the total number of plastics items in each species. Thamnaconus septentrionalis contained the highest abundance of microplastics (7.2 items/individual). The average abundance of plastics in sea benthopelagic fishes was significantly higher than in freshwater benthopelagic fishes by items/individual. The plastics were dominanted by fiber in shape, transparent in color and cellophane in composition. The proportion of plastics in the stomach to the intestines showed great variation in different species, ranging from 0.5 to 1.9 by items/individual. The stomach of Harpodon nehereus and intestines of Pampus cinereus contained the highest number of plastics, (3.3) and (2.7), respectively, by items/individual. Our results suggested that plastic pollution was widespread in the investigated fish species and showed higher abundance in comparison with worldwide studies.

Nevertheless, our knowledge of the impacts of microplastics in freshwater environments and biota is still very limited. The interaction of microplastics with freshwater organisms and the risks associated with the human consumption of organisms that ingested microplastics remain major knowledge gaps. In this study, we assessed the ingestion of microplastics by Hoplosternum littorale, a common freshwater fish heavily consumed by humans in semi-arid regions of South America. We assessed the abundance and diversity of both plastic debris and other food items found in the gut of fishes caught by local fishermen. We observed that 83% of the fish had plastic debris inside the gut, the highest frequency reported for a fish species so far. Most of the plastic debris (88.6%) recovered from the guts of fish were microplastics (<5Â mm), fibres being the most frequent type (46.6%). We observed that fish consumed more microplastics at the urbanized sections of the river, and that the ingestion of microplastics was negatively correlated with the diversity of other food items in the gut of individual fish. Nevertheless, microplastics ingestion appears to have a limited impact on H.Â littorale, and the consequences of human consumption of this fish were not assessed. Our results suggest freshwater biota are vulnerable to microplastics pollution and that urbanization is a major factor contributing to the pollution of freshwater environments with microplastics. We suggest the gut content of fish could be used as a tool for the qualitative assessment of microplastics pollution in freshwater ecosystems. Further research is needed to determine the processes responsible for the high incidence of microplastics ingestion by H.Â littorale, and to evaluate the risk posed to humans by the consumption of freshwater fish that ingested microplastics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",27914860,

Although curcumin is safe even at high doses in humans, it exhibits poor bioavailability, mainly due to poor absorption, fast metabolism, and rapid systemic elimination. To overcome these issues, several approaches, such as nanoparticle-mediated targeted delivery, have been undertaken with different degrees of success. The present study was conducted to compare the neuroprotective effect of curcumin encapsulated in poly(Îµ-caprolactone) and methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) poly(Îµ-caprolactone) nanoparticles in U251 glioblastoma cells. Prepared nanoparticles were physically characterized by laser doppler anemometry, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The results from laser doppler anemometry confirmed that the size of poly(Îµ-caprolactone) and poly(ethylene glycol) poly(Îµ-caprolactone) nanoparticles ranged between 200-240â€‰nm for poly(Îµ-caprolactone) nanoparticles and 30-70â€‰nm for poly(ethylene glycol) poly(Îµ-caprolactone) nanoparticles, and transmission electron microscopy images revealed their spherical shape. Treatment of U251 glioma cells and zebrafish embryos with poly(Îµ-caprolactone) and poly(ethylene glycol) poly(Îµ-caprolactone) nanoparticles loaded with curcumin revealed efficient cellular uptake. The cellular uptake of poly(ethylene glycol) poly(Îµ-caprolactone) nanoparticles was higher in comparison to poly(Îµ-caprolactone) nanoparticles. Moreover, poly(ethylene glycol) poly(Îµ-caprolactone) di-block copolymer-loaded curcumin nanoparticles were able to protect the glioma cells against tBHP induced-oxidative damage better than free curcumin. Together, our results show that curcumin-loaded poly(ethylene glycol) poly(Îµ-caprolactone) di-block copolymer nanoparticles possess significantly stronger neuroprotective effect in U251 human glioma cells compared to free curcumin and curcumin-loaded poly(Îµ-caprolactone) nanoparticles.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome,3 - Intervention",27626946,

METHODS: Arthritis was induced in New Zealand rabbits sensitized with methylated bovine serum albumin and subsequently intra-articularly injected with the antigen. A nanoemulsion of methotrexate labeled with 3H-cholesteryl ether (4 mg/kg methotrexate) was then intravenously injected into four rabbits to determine the plasma decaying curves and the biodistribution of the methotrexate nanoemulsion by radioactive counting. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of the methotrexate nanoemulsion were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Twenty-four hours after arthritis induction, the animals were allocated into three groups, with intravenous injection with saline solution (n=9), methotrexate nanoemulsion (0.5 Âµmol/kg methotrexate, n=7), or commercial methotrexate (0.5 Âµmol/kg, n=4). The rabbits were sacrificed 24 h afterward. Synovial fluid was then collected for protein leakage and cell content analyses and synovial membranes were collected for histopathological analysis. RESULTS: The methotrexate nanoemulsion was taken up mainly by the liver and the uptake by arthritic joints was two-fold greater than that by control joints. The methotrexate nanoemulsion treatment reduced leukocyte influx into the synovial fluid by nearly 65%; in particular, mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells were reduced by 47 and 72%, respectively. In contrast, cell influx was unaffected following treatment with commercial methotrexate. Protein leakage into the arthritic knees of the rabbits was also more limited following methotrexate nanoemulsion treatment than following commercial methotrexate treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The intravenous methotrexate nanoemulsion showed anti-inflammatory effects on the synovia of arthritic joints that were clearly superior to the effects of a commercial methotrexate preparation. This result is conceivably due to greater methotrexate uptake by the joints when the drug is associated with a nanoemulsion.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",26872084,PMC4732406

The histological picture that characterizes both groups especially after 90 days of exposure, suggests that the intestinal functions can be in some cases totally compromised. The worst condition is increasingly evident in the distal intestine of fish fed with polluted PVC pellets respect to control groups (pÂ <Â 0.05) to different exposure times. These first results underline the need to assess the impact of increasing microplastics pollution on the marine trophic web.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Included"", ""Querusche""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | USER-NOTES: {""Ana""=>[""No mortality was observed during the experimental period foreach treatment.

The full moon had a positive influence on the abundance of Gobionellus oceanicus, Cynoscion acoupa and Atherinella brasiliensis, and the new moon on Ulaema lefroyi. The full and new moons also influenced the number of zoeae and megalopae of Ucides cordatus, protozoeae and larvae of caridean shrimps, and the number of hard and soft plastic debris, both <5 and >5â€‰mm. Micro and macroplastics were present in samples from all 12 creeks studied, at densities similar to the third most abundant taxon, R. bahiensis. Cetengraulis edentulus and R. bahiensis showed a strong positive correlation with the last quarter moon, when there was less zooplankton available in the creeks and higher abundance of microplastic threads. Anchovia clupeoides, Diapterus rhombeus, U. lefroyi and hard microplastics were positively associated with different moon phases, when calanoid copepods, Caridean larvae and zoeae of U. cordatus were highly available in the creeks. Cynoscion acoupa, G.Â oceanicus and A. brasiliensis were strongly associated with the full moon, when protozoeae of caridean shrimps and megalopae of U. cordatus were also highly available, as were hard and soft macroplastics, paint chips (<5â€‰mm) and soft microplastics. The results reinforce the role of mangrove creeks as nursery habitats. The moon phases influenced the distribution of fish larvae species, zooplankton and plastic debris by changing their compositions and abundances in the mangrove creeks of the Goiana Estuary when under the influence of different tidal current regimes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",26681492,

In this study, it is found that small and large forms of ZnO-NPs cause various pathologic findings in the target organs at all concentrations. These findings are increased of melanomacrophage aggregates, tubular deformations, necrosis and cytoplasmic vacuolations in the kidney, oedema, mononuclear cell infiltrations, fatty changes, pyknotic nuclei and hepatocellular vacuolations in the liver, hyperplasia, aneurysms, and epithelial liftings in the gills, and hyperplasia, swelled of goblet cells, villus deformations in the intestine. Results showed that respiratory burst and potential killing activity at the small-size ZnO concentration significantly increased compared to the control group (p < 0.05) but significant reductions of these parameters at the large-size ZnO concentrations compared to control (p < 0.05) were measured. These findings demonstrate the potential of each particle size to cause significant damage to the immune system. Moreover, because ZnO NPs inhibit the Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity at all concentrations and increase serum Ca(2+) and Cl(-) levels especially in gill, these particles are osmoregulatory and toxicant for tilapia fish. As a summary, both sizes of the particles have led to organ damage, osmoregulatory changes and immune disorder in tilapia fish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",26398925,

Engineered replacements for fibrous tissues such as the meniscus, annulus fibrosus, tendons, and ligaments are subjected to challenging physiologic loads, and are difficult to track in vivo using standard techniques. The diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal conditions depends heavily on radiographic assessment, and a number of currently available implants utilize radiopaque markers to facilitate in vivo imaging. In this study, we developed a nanofibrous scaffold in which individual fibers included radiopaque nanoparticles. Inclusion of radiopaque particles increased the tensile modulus of the scaffold and imparted radiation attenuation within the range of cortical bone. When scaffolds were seeded with bovine mesenchymal stem cells in vitro, there was no change in cell proliferation and no evidence of promiscuous conversion to an osteogenic phenotype. Scaffolds were implanted ex vivo in a model of a meniscal tear in a bovine joint and in vivo in a model of total disc replacement in the rat coccygeal spine (tail), and were visualized via fluoroscopy and microcomputed tomography. In the disc replacement model, histological analysis at 4 weeks showed that the scaffold was biocompatible and supported the deposition of fibrous tissue in vivo. Nanofibrous scaffolds that include radiopaque nanoparticles provide a biocompatible template with sufficient radiopacity for in vivo visualization in both small and large animal models. This radiopacity may facilitate image-guided implantation and non-invasive long-term evaluation of scaffold location and performance. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The healing capacity of fibrous musculoskeletal tissues is limited, and injury or degeneration of these tissues compromises the standard of living of millions in the US. Tissue engineering repair strategies for the intervertebral disc, meniscus, tendon and ligament have progressed from in vitro to in vivo evaluation using a variety of animal models, and the clinical application of these technologies is imminent. The composition of most scaffold materials however does not allow for visualization by methods available to clinicians (e.g., radiography), and thus it is not possible to assess their performance in situ. In this work, we describe a radiopaque nanofibrous scaffold that can be visualized radiographically in both small and large animal models and serve as a framework for the development of an engineered fibrous tissue.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",26248165,PMC4584206

The fate of the CuNPs in the aqueous media was temperature dependent. At the higher study temperature (26Â±1Â°C), there was both an enhanced particle aggregation and higher rate of dissolution compared with that at the lower study temperature (15Â±1Â°C). 96h LC50s of the CuNPs were 0.68Â±0.15, 0.28Â±0.04 and 0.22Â±0.08mg Cu/L for rainbow trout, fathead minnow and zebrafish, respectively.

While MCT have deleterious effects, we have shown that parenteral nutrition emulsion containing LCT or LCT and MCT associated to n-3 and n-9 fatty acids have no effect on endotoxin-induced cell death and inflammation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",25038627,

The total density (n 100 m(-3)) of microplastics represented half of the total fish larvae density and was comparable to fish eggs density. Soft, hard plastics, threads and paint chips were found in the samples (n=216). Their origins are probably the river basin, the sea and fisheries (including the lobster fleet). In some occasions, the amount of microplastics surpassed that of Ichthyoplankton. The highest amount of microplastics was observed during the late rainy season, when the environment is under influence of the highest river flow, which induces the runoff of plastic fragments to the lower estuary. The density of microplastics in the water column will determine their bioavailability to planktivorous organisms, and then to larger predators, possibly promoting the transfer of microplastic between trophic levels. These findings are important for better informing researchers in future works and as basic information for managerial actions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",24769564,

After subcutaneous or intravenous injection of USPIO, normal lymph node tissues uptake these nano-particles, but tumor cells do not. Thus, tumor metastasis can be detected using this contrast agent. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to access the feasibility of USPIO enhanced MRI for the detection of cervical lymph node metastasis in a pyriform sinus carcinoma animal model and to investigate the ability of USPIO to enhance images of cervical lymph node metastases. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Twenty New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into tumor and inflammatory groups, and each group contained 10 rabbits. In the inflammatory group, a 0.5 ml egg yolk emulsion was injected into the sub-mandibular muscle of the rabbits to induce an inflammatory reaction in their cervical lymph nodes. In the tumor group, a VX2 tumor tissue suspension was transplanted into the pyriform sinus sub-mucosa of the rabbits using direct laryngoscope. Four weeks after the tumor or egg yolk injection, MRIs were performed before and after USPIO injection to observe the imaging enhancement features of USPIO. After that, a histo-pathological analysis was performed for all rabbits. We found the metastatic lymph nodes had no signal reduced intensity or irregular signal reduced intensity on T2-weighted image by using USPIO enhancement. In the tumor group,the sensitivity and specificity of plain MRI were 57.6% and 60.7%. The corresponding values of USPIO-enhanced MRl were 96.1% and 85.7%. (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The features and the extent of the lymph node metastases corresponded to those observed on USPIO-enhanced MR images. USPIO-enhanced MRI is useful for the detection and estimation of lymph node metastasis in this cervical carcinoma animal model.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",24733438,PMC3986250

During this period, developmental endpoints, including lethality, heart rate, and hatching rate, were evaluated by microscopy for different stages of medaka embryonic development. To compare toxic sensitivity, acute adult toxicity was assessed. There was no difference in acute lethal toxicity between embryo and adult medaka. Interestingly, we found that the increase in stepwise toxicity was dependent on the developmental stage of the embryo. Lethal embryonic toxicity increased from exposure days 1 to 3 and exposure days 5 to 8, whereas there was no change from exposure days 3 to 5. In addition, 7 d exposure to 0.8 mg/L AgNPs resulted in significant heart beat retardation in medaka embryos. AgNPs also caused a dose-dependent decrease in the hatching rate and body length of larvae. These results indicate that AgNP exposure causes severe developmental toxicity to medaka embryos and that toxicity levels are enhanced at certain developmental stages, which should be taken into consideration in assessments of metallic NPs toxicity to embryos.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",23984374,PMC3745929

However, previously reported models had issues in terms of invasiveness of tumor inoculation, control of tumor aggressiveness and incidence of complications. PURPOSE: We aimed to develop a minimally invasive rabbit VX2 lung cancer model suitable for imaging and transbronchial interventional studies. METHODS: New Zealand white rabbits and VX2 tumors were used in the study. An ultra-thin bronchoscope was inserted through a miniature laryngeal mask airway into the bronchus. Different numbers of VX2 tumor cells were selectively inoculated into the lung parenchyma or subcarinal mediastinum to create a uniform tumor with low incidence of complications. The model was characterized by CT, FDG-PET, and endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). Liposomal dual-modality contrast agent was used to evaluate liposome drug delivery system in this model. RESULTS: Both peripheral and mediastinal lung tumor models were created. The tumor making success rate was 75.8% (25/33) in the peripheral lung tumor model and 60% (3/5) in the mediastinal tumor model. The group of 1.0Ã—10(6) of VX2 tumor cells inoculation showed a linear growth curve with less incidence of complications. Radial probe EBUS visualized the internal structure of the tumor and the size measurement correlated well with CT measurements (r(2)â€Š=â€Š0.98). Over 7 days of continuous enhancement of the lung tumor by liposomal contrast in the lung tumor was confirmed both CT and fluorescence imaging.

The impact of such pollutants on living organisms has been up to now approached by classical toxicology in which huge doses of toxic compounds, environmentally irrelevant, are displayed through routes that never occur in the lifespan of organisms (for instance injecting a bolus of mercury to an animal although the main route is through prey and fish eating). We wanted to address the effect of such pollutants on the muscle and brain mitochondrial bioenergetics under realistic conditions, at unprecedented low doses, using an aquatic model animal, the zebrafish Danio rerio. We developed an original method to measure brain mitochondrial respiration: a single brain was put in 1.5 mL conical tube containing a respiratory buffer. Brains were gently homogenized by 13 strokes with a conical plastic pestle, and the homogenates were immediately used for respiration measurements. Skinned muscle fibers were prepared by saponin permeabilization. Zebrafish were contaminated with food containing 13 Î¼g of methylmercury (MeHg)/g, an environmentally relevant dose. In permeabilized muscle fibers, we observed a strong inhibition of both state 3 mitochondrial respiration and cytochrome c oxidase activity after 49 days of MeHg exposure. We measured a dramatic decrease in the rate of ATP release by skinned muscle fibers. Contrarily to muscles, brain mitochondrial respiration was not modified by MeHg exposure although brain accumulated twice as much MeHg than muscles. When zebrafish were exposed to 30 Î¼g/L of waterborne U, the basal mitochondrial respiratory control ratio was decreased in muscles after 28 days of exposure. This was due to an increase of the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability. The impact of a daily ration of food containing gold nanoparticles of two sizes (12 and 50 nm) was investigated at a very low dose for 60 days (40 ng gold/fish/day). Mitochondrial dysfunctions appeared in brain and muscle for both tested sizes. In conclusion, at low environmental doses, dietary or waterborne heavy metals impinged on zebrafish tissue mitochondrial respiration. Due to its incredible simplicity avoiding tedious and time-consuming mitochondria isolation, our one-pot method allowing brain respiratory analysis should give colleagues the incentive to use zebrafish brain as a model in bioenergetics.

Here, we summarize recent advances of new generation flow cytometry for in vivo noninvasive label-free or targeted detection of cells in blood, lymph, bone, cerebral and plant vasculatures using photoacoustic (PA) detection techniques, multispectral high-pulse-repetition-rate lasers, tunable ultrasharp (up to 0.8 nm) rainbow plasmonic nanoprobes, positive and negative PA contrasts, in vivo magnetic enrichment, time-of-flight cell velocity measurement, PA spectral analysis, and integration of PA, photothermal (PT), fluorescent, and Raman methods. Unique applications of this tool are reviewed with a focus on ultrasensitive detection of normal blood cells at different functional states (e.g., apoptotic and necrotic) and rare abnormal cells including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cancer stem cells, pathogens, clots, sickle cells as well as pharmokinetics of nanoparticles, dyes, microbubbles and drug nanocarriers. Using this tool we discovered that palpation, biopsy, or surgery can enhance CTC release from primary tumors, increasing the risk of metastasis. The novel fluctuation flow cytometry provided the opportunity for the dynamic study of blood rheology including red blood cell aggregation and clot formation in different medical conditions (e.g., blood disorders, cancer, or surgery). Theranostics, as a combination of PA diagnosis and PT nanobubble-amplified multiplex therapy, was used for eradication of CTCs, purging of infected blood, and thrombolysis of clots using PA guidance to control therapy efficiency. In vivo flow cytometry using a portable fiber-based devices can provide a breakthrough platform for early diagnosis of cancer, infection and cardiovascular disorders with a potential to inhibit, if not prevent, metastasis, sepsis, and strokes or heart attack by well-timed personalized therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",22749928,PMC4799719

The high adjuvant capacity of MS, together with its biodegradability and low toxicity to fish, makes this new vaccine an economical, effective and safe alternative to oil-based adjuvants for the immunoprophylaxis of scuticociliatosis in turbot.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention | USER-NOTES: {""Ana""=>[""Chitosan-PVMMA MS"", ""acho que não é""]}",22513203,

These conditions affect the lives of millions of people worldwide and result in significant morbidity and mortality. It is thus crucial to develop novel methodologies to enhance the detection and treatment of these disorders. Thrombolysis, or the dissolution of blood clots, relies upon the administration of exogenous plasminogen activators (PAs) that lyse fibrin. Yet, there are several drawbacks to the use of current PAs, including significant risks of uncontrolled bleeding and suboptimal efficacy and pharmacokinetics. Nanomaterials are well positioned to address these priority issues in thrombolysis, via the alteration of PA pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Additionally, due to the multifunctional nature of nanoparticles, these thrombolytics may be targeted to the site of occlusion, effectively concentrating the drug where it is most needed. Herein, we describe the methodology associated with the synthesis of a novel thrombus-targeted fibrinolytic nanoagent. At each step of the synthesis, we analyze the nanomaterials, including their physical properties and their ability to bind to thrombosis targets of interest. The effect of the conjugation of tPA to the nanoparticle surface on the amidolytic and fibrinolytic activities of nanoagents is also investigated. Lastly, the in vivo binding of the targeted thrombolytic to intravascular thrombi is examined.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,3 - Intervention",22449927,

However, the evolution, severity, and pathophysiological consequences of vascular barrier damage in atherosclerotic plaque remain unknown, in part because quantifiable methods and experimental models are lacking for its in vivo assessment. OBJECTIVE: To develop quantitative nondestructive methodologies and models for detecting vascular barrier disruption in advanced plaques. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sustained hypercholesterolemia in New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits for >7-14 months engendered endothelial barrier disruption that was evident from massive and rapid passive penetration and intimal trapping of perfluorocarbon-core nanoparticles (PFC-NP: âˆ¼250 nm diameter) after in vivo circulation for as little as 1 hour. Only older plaques (>7 mo), but not younger plaques (<3 mo) demonstrated the marked enhancement of endothelial permeability to these particles. Electron microscopy revealed a complex of subintimal spongiform channels associated with endothelial apoptosis, superficial erosions, and surface-penetrating cholesterol crystals. Fluorine ((19)F) magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) enabled absolute quantification (in nanoMolar) of the passive permeation of PFC-NP into the disrupted vascular lesions by sensing the unique spectral signatures from the fluorine core of plaque-bound PFC-NP. CONCLUSIONS: The application of semipermeant nanoparticles reveals the presence of profound barrier disruption in later stage plaques and focuses attention on the disrupted endothelium as a potential contributor to plaque vulnerability. The response to sustained high cholesterol levels yields a progressive deterioration of the vascular barrier that can be quantified with fluorine MRI/MRS of passively permeable nanostructures. The possibility of plaque classification based on the metric of endothelial permeability to nanoparticles is suggested.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",22028868,PMC3196552

RESULTS: CS vectoring of pTp92 or pIL-2 were both demonstrated to augment anti-Tp92 antibody levels induced by pTp92 DNA vaccines. Interestingly, the combination of CS vectored Tp92 and pIL-2 led to the greatest enhancements of anti-Tp92 antibodies and T-cell proliferation (p < 0.05). At week 10 after the first immunization, 15 of the 18 rabbits in each group were challenged with Tp Nichols strain and monitored for skin lesions and ulcer lesions. Ratios of positive skin lesions and ratios of ulcer lesions in groups immunized with pTp92 were significantly lower than those of the empty vector or PBS groups (p < 0.05), demonstrating that pTp92 immunization elicited significant protective efficacy against the Tp Nichols strain challenge. CS vectored and pIL-2 adjuvanted pTp92 immunized animals exhibited the lowest rates of positive skin and ulcer lesions. METHODS: Male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly assigned to groups (n = 18/group) and immunized intramuscularly with pTp92 based plasmid DNA constructs (100 Î¼g of DNA/rabbit/immunization). Two weeks before Tp challenge (Week 8), three rabbits from each group were used to determine cytokine measurements and fifteen rabbits from each group were used for Tp challenge studies. CONCLUSIONS: Intramuscular injection of pTp92 induced strong humoral and cellular immune responses and conferred protection from Tp challenge in rabbits. The use of CS as a pTp92 vector or pIL-2 as an adjuvant achieved a superior level of protective efficacy against Tp challenge, however CS vectored, IL-2 adjuvanted pTp92 immunization conferred the highest level of protective efficacy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",21941092,

NELL-1 (Nel-like molecule-1; Nel [a protein strongly expressed in neural tissue encoding epidermal growth factor like domain]), a protein first characterized in the context of premature cranial suture fusion, is believed to accelerate differentiation along the osteochondral lineage. We previously demonstrated the ability of NELL-1 protein to maintain the cartilaginous phenotype of explanted rabbit chondrocytes in vitro. Our objective in the current study is to determine whether NELL-1 can affect endogenous chondrocytes in an in vivo cartilage defect model. To generate the implant, NELL-1 was incorporated into chitosan nanoparticles and embedded into alginate hydrogels. These implants were press fit into 3-mm circular osteochondral defects created in the femoral condylar cartilage of 3-month-old New Zealand White rabbits (n=10). Controls included unfilled defects (n=8) and defects filled with phosphate-buffered saline-loaded chitosan nanoparticles embedded in alginate hydrogels (n=8). Rabbits were sacrificed 3 months postimplantation for histological analysis. Defects filled with alginate containing NELL-1 demonstrated significantly improved cartilage regeneration. Remarkably, histology of NELL-1-treated defects closely resembled that of native cartilage, including stronger Alcian blue and Safranin-O staining and increased deposition of type II collagen and absence of the bone markers type I collagen and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Our results suggest that NELL-1 may produce functional cartilage with properties similar to native cartilage, and is an exciting candidate for tissue engineering-based approaches for treating diverse pathologies of cartilage defects and degeneration.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",21902605,PMC3267973

The carbon nanospheres were prepared by a ""green"" method, and the high loading of QDs on carbon nanospheres led to a 4-times increased ECL intensity with dissolved O(2) as the coreactant. Using xanthine oxidase (XOD) as a model, an ECL biosensor was fabricated by immobilizing the enzyme on the mixing membrane of PFCNSs and QDs. The ECL biosensor showed a fast response to hypoxanthine with a linear concentration range from 2.5 Ã— 10(-8) to 1.4 Ã— 10(-5)M. The limit of detection was 5 nM at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The assay results of hypoxanthine in fish samples were in a good agreement with the reference values by amperometric technique.

Some of these reports continue to lead to misconceptions of the environmental effects of C60. Critical review of the evidence (2007-2011) indicates that aqueous nC60 have minimal potential to produce ROS and that oxidative stress in fish is not induced by environmentally relevant exposure to nC60. Future studies should acknowledge that current evidence indicates low toxicity of nC60 and refrain from citing articles that attribute toxicity in fish to nC60 based on methods shown to be compromised by experimental artifacts.

Lesions were pronouncedly reduced by treatment with paclitaxel associated with LDE. This study aimed to test the hypothesis of whether LDE-paclitaxel is able to concentrate in grafted hearts of rabbits and to ameliorate coronary allograft vasculopathy after the transplantation procedure. METHODS: Twenty-one New Zealand rabbits fed 0.5% cholesterol were submitted to heterotopic heart transplantation at the cervical position. All rabbits undergoing transplantation were treated with cyclosporin A (10 mg Â· kg(-1) Â· d(-1) by mouth). Eleven rabbits were treated with LDE-paclitaxel (4 mg/kg body weight paclitaxel per week administered intravenously for 6 weeks), and 10 control rabbits were treated with 3 mL/wk intravenous saline. Four control animals were injected with LDE labeled with [(14)C]-cholesteryl oleate ether to determine tissue uptake. RESULTS: Radioactive LDE uptake by grafts was 4-fold that of native hearts. In both groups the coronary arteries of native hearts showed no stenosis, but treatment with LDE-paclitaxel reduced the degree of stenosis in grafted hearts by 50%. The arterial luminal area in grafts of the treated group was 3-fold larger than in control animals. LDE-paclitaxel treatment resulted in a 7-fold reduction of macrophage infiltration. In grafted hearts LDE-paclitaxel treatment reduced the width of the intimal layer and inhibited the destruction of the medial layer. No toxicity was observed in rabbits receiving LDE-paclitaxel treatment. CONCLUSIONS: LDE-paclitaxel improved posttransplantation injury to the grafted heart. The novel therapeutic approach for heart transplantation management validated here is thus a promising strategy to be explored in future clinical studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",21458008,

More than 80% of patients with prostate cancer harbor multiple geographically discrete cancer foci at the time of diagnosis. Emerging data suggest that these foci are molecularly distinct consistent with the hypothesis that they arise as independent clones. One of the strongest arguments is the heterogeneity observed in the status of E26 transformation specific (ETS) rearrangements between discrete tumor foci. The clonal evolution of individual prostate cancer foci based on recent studies demonstrates intertumoral heterogeneity with intratumoral homogeneity. The issue of multifocality and interfocal heterogeneity is important and has not been fully elucidated due to lack of the systematic evaluation of ETS rearrangements in multiple tumor sites. The current study investigates the frequency of multiple gene rearrangements within the same focus and between different cancer foci. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays were designed to detect the four most common recurrent ETS gene rearrangements. In a cohort of 88 men with localized prostate cancer, we found ERG, ETV1, and ETV5 rearrangements in 51% (44/86), 6% (5/85), and 1% (1/86), respectively. None of the cases demonstrated ETV4 rearrangements. Mutual exclusiveness of ETS rearrangements was observed in the majority of cases; however, in six cases, we discovered multiple ETS or 5' fusion partner rearrangements within the same tumor focus.

Macrophage imaging may serve as a biomarker to identify subclinical inflamed lesions, to predict future risk, and to aid in the assessment of novel therapies. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test the hypothesis that nanoparticle-enhanced, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can measure plaque macrophage accumulation, we used 3-T MRI with a macrophage-targeted superparamagnetic nanoparticle preparation (monocrystalline iron oxide nanoparticles-47 [MION-47]) in cholesterol-fed New Zealand White rabbits 6 months after balloon injury. In vivo MRI visualized thickened abdominal aortas on both T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images (T1 spin echo, 20 axial slices per animal; T2 spin echo, 28 slices per animal). Seventy-two hours after MION-47 injection, aortas exhibited lower T2 signal intensity compared with before contrast imaging (signal intensity ratio, aortic wall/muscle: before, 1.44 Â± 0.26 versus after, 0.95 Â± 0.22; 164 slices; P<0.01), whereas T1 spin echo images showed no significant change. MRI on ex vivo specimens provided similar results. Histological studies colocalized iron accumulation with immunoreactive macrophages in atheromata. The magnitude of signal intensity reduction on T2 spin echo in vivo images further correlated with macrophage areas in situ (150 slices; r=0.73). Treatment with rosuvastatin for 3 months yielded diminished macrophage content (P<0.05) and reversed T2 signal intensity changes (P<0.005). Signal changes in rosuvastatin-treated rabbits correlated with reduced macrophage burden (r=0.73). In vitro validation studies showed concentration-dependent MION-47 uptake by human primary macrophages.

Using light and confocal fluorescence video-microscopy, we measured heart-rate and blood flow in the dorsal aorta and caudal artery of zebrafish larvae that had been exposed to a number of toxic and non-toxic microparticles and nanoparticles. Diesel exhaust particles (DEP), carboxy-charged Latex beads (carboxy-beads) and toxic alumina (Taimicron TM300), but not non-toxic alumina (Baikalox A125), were found to promote both skin and gut cell damage, increased leukocyte invasion into the epidermis, tail muscle ischaemia and haemostasis within the caudal artery of free swimming zebrafish larvae. The presence of sodium sulfite, a reducing agent, or warfarin, an anticoagulant, within the system water abrogated the effects of both toxic alumina and carboxy-beads but not DEP. Genetic manipulation of skin barrier function augmented skin damage and haemostasis, even for the non-toxic alumina. The toxic effects of carboxy-beads were still apparent after leukocyte numbers were depleted with anti-Pu.1 morpholino. We conclude that particle uptake across skin epithelium and gut mucosal barriers, or the presence of leukocytes, is not required for particle-induced haemostasis while a compromised skin barrier function accentuated tissue injury and haemostasis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: !,ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""Latex beads = PS""]}",20174755,

Maximum width of the optic tectum, as an indicator of midbrain development, decreased significantly in a dose-related manner. Furthermore, silver nanoparticles exposure at all concentrations induced a variety of morphological malformations such as edema, spinal abnormalities, finfold abnormalities, heart malformations and eye defects. Histopathological observations also confirmed the occurrence of abnormal eye development induced by AgNPs. The data showed non-linear or U-shaped dose-response patterns for growth retardation at 5 days of postfertilization, as well as the incidence of abnormalities.

We examined uptake of nanoparticles by two species of suspension-feeding bivalves (mussels, Mytilus edulis; oysters, Crassostrea virginica), which capture individual particles < 1 microm with a retention efficiency of <15%. Given this limitation, it would appear that nanoparticles could not be ingested in large numbers. During certain times of the year, however, >70% of suspended particles are incorporated within aggregates that are > 100 microm in size. Therefore, we delivered bivalves fluorescently labeled, 100-nm polystyrene beads that were either (1) dispersed or (2) embedded within aggregates generated in the laboratory. Results indicate that aggregates significantly enhance the uptake of 100-nm particles. Nanoparticles had a longer gut retention time than 10-microm polystyrene beads suggesting that nanoparticles were transported to the digestive gland.

Results indicate that this surface produced by simple hydrothermal treatment may be effective in improving the osseointegration of implants with micro-topographically complex surface structures in areas of loose cancellous bone.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",19489932,

In the 1990 s it was recognized that a minor source of microplastic pollution was derived from liquid hand-cleansers that would have been rarely used by the average consumer. In 2009, however, the average consumer is likely to be using microplastic-containing products on a daily basis, as the majority of facial cleansers now contain polyethylene microplastics which are not captured by wastewater plants and will enter the oceans. Four microplastic-containing facial cleansers available in New Zealand supermarkets were used to quantify the size of the polythelene fragments. Three-quarters of the brands had a modal size of <100 microns and could be immediately ingested by planktonic organisms at the base of the food chain. Over time the microplastics will be subject to UV-degradation and absorb hydrophobic materials such as PCBs, making them smaller and more toxic in the long-term. Marine scientists need to educate the public to the dangers of using products that pose an immediate and long-term threat to the health of the oceans and the food we eat.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",19481226,

Substantial production volumes and environmental release are anticipated. QD toxicity may be intrinsic to their physicochemical properties, or result from the release of toxic components during breakdown. We hypothesized that developing zebrafish could be used to identify and distinguish these different types of toxicity. Embryos were exposed to aqueous suspensions of CdSe(core)/ZnS(shell) QDs functionalized with either poly-L-lysine or poly(ethylene glycol) terminated with methoxy, carboxylate, or amine groups. Toxicity was influenced by the QD coating, which also contributed to the QD suspension stability. At sublethal concentrations, many QD preparations produced characteristic signs of Cd toxicity that weakly correlated with metallothionein expression, indicating that QDs are only slightly degraded in vivo. QDs also produced distinctly different toxicity that could not be explained by Cd release. Using the zebrafish model, we were able to distinguish toxicity intrinsic to QDs from that caused by released metal ions. We conclude that developing zebrafish provide a rapid, low-cost approach for assessing structure-toxicity relationships of nanoparticles.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",19350942,PMC2674626

Fullerene aggregates formed precipitates as a result of mixing in natural seawater, and levels of aqua-nC60 were significantly increased in bottom waters after 24 h. Exposure of Fundulus heteroclitus embryos, larvae, and adults to increasing concentrations of aqua-nC60 resulted in very little mortality, and no median lethal concentrations could be calculated at < or = 10 mg/L. Aggregates of aqua-nC60 did adhere to the chorion but did not affect development of the embryos or their hatching success. Movements of aqua-nC60 through the chorion and into the embryo tended to increase with higher exposure levels; however, the concentrations were extremely low and did not differ significantly. Larvae exposed to increasing concentrations of aqua-nC60 exhibited a significant dose-dependent increase in total glutathione (GSH). This was accompanied by a decreasing trend in lipid peroxidation (LPO), but LPO was not statistically different between treatments. Adult F. heteroclitus exposed to increasing concentrations of aqua-nC60 exhibited an increase in total GSH in liver tissue but not in the gill. No significant effects on LPO were observed in either tissue. Thus, we conclude that aqua-nC60 affects the oxidative stress response of F. heteroclitus and that increased antioxidant defenses provide some physiological tolerance for these materials.

This paper is an observational study where we aim to describe the toxicity of TiO2 NPs to the main body systems of rainbow trout. Stock solutions of dispersed TiO2 NPs were prepared by sonication without using solvents. A semi-static test system was used to expose rainbow trout to either a freshwater control, 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg l(-1) TiO2 NPs for up to 14 days. Exposure to TiO2 NPs caused some gill pathologies including oedema and thickening of the lamellae. No major haematological or blood disturbances were observed in terms of red and white blood cell counts, haematocrit values, whole blood haemoglobin, and plasma Na+ or K+ concentrations. Tissue metal levels (Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mn) were generally unaffected. However, some exposure concentration-dependent changes in tissue Cu and Zn levels were observed, especially in the brain. Exposure to TiO2 NPs caused statistically significant decreases in Na+K+-ATPase activity (ANOVA, P<0.05) in the gills and intestine, and a trend of decreasing enzyme activity in the brain (the latter was not statistically significant). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) showed exposure concentration-dependent and statistically significant (ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test, P<0.05) increases (two-fold or more) in the gill, intestine and brain, but not the liver during exposure to TiO2 NPs compared to controls. TiO2 NP exposure caused statistically significant (ANOVA, P<0.05) increases in the total glutathione levels in the gills, but depletion of hepatic glutathione compared to controls. Total glutathione levels in the brain and intestine were unaffected. Liver cells exposed to TiO2 NPs showed minor fatty change and lipidosis, and some hepatocytes showed condensed nuclear bodies (apoptotic bodies). Fish probably ingested water containing TiO2 NPs during exposure (stress-induced drinking) which may have resulted in some areas of erosion on the intestinal epithelium. Overall we conclude that titanium dioxide nanoparticles are not a major ionoregulatory toxicant, or haemolytic, at the concentration and exposure times used. Respiratory distress is a concern and sub-lethal toxicity involves oxidative stress, organ pathologies, and the induction of anti-oxidant defences, such as glutathione.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",17727975,

Alternatively, with regard to commercial nanoparticles, the environmental, health and safety (EHS) framework would include a minimum base set of toxicity studies which should be supported by the companies that are developing nano-based products. The minimum base set could include the following criteria: substantial particle characterization, pulmonary toxicity studies, acute dermal toxicity and sensitization studies, acute oral and ocular toxicity studies, along with screening type genotoxicity, and aquatic toxicity studies. We report here the toxicity results of a base set of hazard tests on a set of newly developed, well-characterized, ultrafine TiO(2) (uf-TiO(2)) particle-types. In vivo pulmonary toxicity studies in rats demonstrated low inflammatory potential and lung tissue toxicity. Acute dermal irritation studies in rabbits and local lymph node assay results in mice indicated that uf-TiO(2) was not a skin irritant or dermal sensitizer. Acute oral toxicity studies demonstrated very low toxicity and uf-TiO(2) produced short-term and reversible ocular conjunctival redness in rabbits. Genotoxicity tests demonstrated that uf-TiO(2) was negative in both the bacterial reverse mutation test and in an in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration test with Chinese hamster ovary cells. The results of aquatic toxicity screening studies demonstrated that uf-TiO(2) exhibited low concern for aquatic hazard in unaerated, 48h, static acute tests using the water flea, Daphnia magna; exhibited low concern for aquatic hazard in unaerated, 96h, static acute tests using the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss; and exhibited medium concern in a 72h acute test using the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata.

METHODS: NLADR with a mean diameter of 120 nm was prepared by pH gradient-driven drug encapsulation method. VX(2) tumor mass suspension was injected into the breast tissues of 50 female New Zealand White rabbits. Six weeks after the inoculation 38 surviving tumor-bearing rabbits were randomly divided into 5 groups: group A (control group), receiving a sham treatment; group B, receiving subcutaneous injection of NLADR with a dose of 1 mg/kg into the areas adjacent to the implanted tumor; group C, receiving intravenous injection of NLADR with a dose of 1 mg/kg; group D, receiving NLADR with a dose of 1 mg/kg administered by subcutaneous injection combined with intravenous injection with half of the whole dose for both routes; and group E, receiving intravenous injection of free adriamycin (FADR). The treatment was repeated every 48 hours. The rabbits were killed 48 hours after the third treatment. The breast tumors, axillary lymph nodes, and all of the metastatic tumors anatomically detected in distant organs were collected. The sizes of tumors and axillary nodes before and after treatment were measured. Necrosis of tumor tissue was assessed pathologically. The mRNA expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was determined using RT-PCR. Apoptosis was identified and quantified as apoptosis index (AI) using TUNEL method. RESULTS: The average growth rate of tumor was the highest in group A (1.58) and the lowest in group C (1.33). The average growth rate of axillary lymph nodes was the highest in group A (3.70), significantly higher than in any other groups (all P = 0.00); and was the lowest in group B, significantly lower than groups A, C, and E (all P < 0.01), however without a significant difference between groups B and D (P = 0.148). The PCNA mRNA expression level of the implanted tumor in groups C was the lowest, significant lowest then those in group A and B (both P < 0.01). The sequence of PCNA mRNA in the axillary lymph nodes was group B < group D < group C < group E < group A with significant differences between group B and groups A, C, and E. The sequence of PCNA mRNA in the mediastinal lymph nodes was group B < Group E < group D < group C < group A. The PCNA mRNA expression level was the lowest in group D, significantly lower than that in group A (P = 0.011). Necrosis of implanted tumor, metastatic foci in lung and liver, and lymph nodes was obvious in groups C, D, and E. Necrosis of implanted tumor and metastatic foci in lung and liver was significantly obvious in group C than in group D (P = 0.000 and P = 0.022). Necrosis of the implanted tumor was significantly more obvious in group C than in group F (P = 0.033). Necrosis of axillary lymph nodes was significantly more obvious in group than in groups C and E (P = 0.000 and P = 0.000). The values of AI of the implanted tumor in groups C and D were 16.74% and 18.04%, both significantly higher than those in group E (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04), and those of group E were significantly higher than those in groups A and B (both P < 0.01). The AI value of the axillary lymph nodes was 21.73%, significantly than those in groups A, C, and E (all P < 0.01). The average AI values of the metastatic foci were 16.52%, 15.77%, and 14.50%, all significantly higher than that in group B (all P < 0.01), and that of group B was significantly higher than that in group A (P = 0.039).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: New Zealand White rabbits maintained on a high cholesterol/fat diet were subjected to balloon injury to the abdominal aorta. Ferumoxtran-10 or ferumoxytol (500 micromol/kg) was administered at 2, 4, and 8 weeks following injury. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed immediately prior to, immediately after, and 6 days post-contrast administration. Ex vivo MRI, histologic, and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) iron analyses were performed on the excised vessels. RESULTS: The blood pool clearance of ferumoxytol (t(1/2) < or = 6 hours) was more rapid than that of ferumoxtran-10 (t(1/2) < or = 48 hours). Decreased in vivo MRI signal intensity in the abdominal aorta was observed at 2, 4, and 8 weeks following injury with ferumoxtran-10, but not with ferumoxytol. Consistent with these observations, ex vivo MRI signal intensity was decreased in the ferumoxtran-10 vessels, and to a lesser degree in the ferumoxytol vs. control vessels (- contrast agent). In contrast, in vitro macrophage phagocytosis of USPIO was four to six fold greater with ferumoxytol than with ferumoxtran-10. Additionally, the absolute iron content correlated with ex vivo MRI signal intensity in all vessels (r = -0.86, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the exposure period of atherosclerotic plaque to USPIO rather than the kinetics of the USPIO uptake by plaque alone is a critical criterion for experimental design of in vivo studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",15779033,

The aim of the present study was to test the ability of the solid lipid nanoparticle technology to reduce the aquatic toxicity and concurrently retain the insecticidal activity of GCH. Applying the lipid Compritol) 888 ATO and homogenising the crude o/w emulsions of melted GCH and compritol at different pressures, 150-1500 bar, solid lipid microparticle formulations were produced having average particle diameters between 0.3 and 100 microm. GCH had limited solubility in the solid lipid phase and probably the lipid showed transition from the alpha to the beta' crystal form upon storage. This resulted in expulsion of GCH from the lipid and appearance of GCH crystals in the water phase of the formulations. By using as surfactant polyvinyl alcohol instead of a mixture of Synperonic PE/F68 and sodium lauryl sulphate the appearance of GCH crystals was delayed. This delay was probably due to the fact that the GCH solubility was significantly lower in aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solutions than in solutions of the above-mentioned surfactant mixture. Compared with a traditional emulsifiable concentrate formulation of GCH the solid lipid microparticle formulations reduced the toxicity towards fish (Brachydanio rerio) and daphnia (Daphnia magna) by a factor 10 and 63, respectively. The solid lipid microparticle formulations and the emulsifiable concentrate formulation had about the same insecticidal activity on both Dysdercus cingulatus nymphs and Spodoptera littoralis larvae.

The present study tested the efficacy of a novel systemic delivery nanoparticle PXL for reducing in-stent restenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: A saline-reconstituted formulation of PXL stabilized by albumin nanoparticles (nPXL) was tested in 38 New Zealand White rabbits receiving bilateral iliac artery stents. Doses of nPXL (1.0 to 5.0 mg/kg) were administered as a 10-minute intra-arterial infusion; control animals received vehicle (0.9% normal saline). In a follow-up chronic experiment, nPXL 5.0 mg/kg was given at stenting with or without an intravenous 3.5-mg/kg repeat nPXL dose at 28 days; these studies were terminated at 3 months. At 28 days, mean neointimal thickness was reduced (P< or =0.02) by doses of nPXL > or =2.5 mg/kg with evidence of delayed healing. The efficacy of a single dose of nPXL 5.0 mg/kg, however, was lost by 90 days. In contrast, a second repeat dose of nPXL 3.5 mg/kg given 28 days after stenting resulted in sustained suppression of neointimal thickness at 90 days (P< or =0.009 versus single dose nPXL 5.0 mg/kg and controls) with nearly complete neointimal healing. CONCLUSIONS: Although systemic nPXL reduces neointimal growth at 28 days, a single repeat dose was required for sustained neointimal suppression. Thus, this novel systemic formulation of PXL may allow adjustment of dose at the stent treatment site and prove to be a useful adjunct for the clinical prevention of in-stent restenosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",12208792,

The ability of M. phlei DNA-chitosan nanoparticles to inhibit melanoma cell division was determined relative to M. phlei DNA and a cationic liposomal M. phlei DNA formulation. M. phlei DNA had antiproliferative activity (MTT reduction, IC50 = 0.9 mg/ml) without intrinsic cytotoxicity (LDH release, ED50 > 50 microg/ml). Cationic polyphosphate chitosan nanoparticles were inert (antiproliferative IC50 > 1 mg/ml, ED50 > 1 mg/ml). M. phlei DNA-chitosan nanoparticles were 20-fold more potent than M. phlei DNA. Cationic DOTAP/DOPE liposomes were cytostatic (IC50 = 49 microg/ml) and cytotoxic (ED50 = 87 microg/ml), and complexation of M. phlei DNA resulted in a significant reduction of antiproliferative activity. Chitosan nanoparticles may therefore be appropriate delivery vehicles for M. phlei DNA.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",11770702,

Lip enlargement was performed in 59 patients, and lip reduction was performed in 7 patients. Indications were purely aesthetic in 61 cases and reconstructive in 5 cases. The following surgical techniques were used for lip augmentation: implantation of crystal silicone, polyacrylamide hydrogel, Gore-Tex tubes, autologous fat, and dermis-fat graft. A new instrument originally designed by the author, the dermis-fat graft passer, significantly speeded up and facilitated execution of the latter procedure. Other operations included V-Y plasty, lip lifting by buffalo horn excision, lip lengthening by frenulum plasty, and lip reduction by wavy tangential excision. Eighty-six percent of patients could be followed up; the mean length of follow-up was 4.2 years. Use of silicone microparticles (Bioplastique) was abandoned because of the tendency for lumping. Polyacrylamide gel is promising because of its ease of use, and Gore-Tex tubes are promising because of their ability to create and accentuate the Cupid's bow form for the upper lip. However, these products are new, and follow-up studies with longer observation times are needed to reach definite conclusions. Of these studied methods, autologous fat transplant was found to be particularly useful for enlargement and restoration in cases of age-related atrophy of the lips and perioral tissues. Dermis-fat grafting was the most efficient, versatile, and reliable method of lip enlargement. Long-term survival of transplanted autologous tissues was confirmed by histologic studies of biopsy specimens.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",10724279,

However, identification of nanoplastics in environmental samples remains a great challenge, and thus highlighting the great need for new approach. Herein, for the first time, we show that surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offered a feasible approach to identify trace polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics, which is the most produced nanoplastics and also widely presented in the natural environment. We found that when PS nanoplastics were surrounded by SERS-active silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), a set of Raman spectra with chemical information could be obtained via SERS mapping. This map showed the potential PS distribution of the nanoplastics on a silicon wafer, allowing a quick and detailed analysis of the nanoplastics. Moreover, the proposed method was able to identify previously undetectable plastic particles as small as similar to 50 nm spiked in real water, demonstrating the power of SERS to probe nanoplastics. Our work is thus an important step in nanoplastic research, and we believe that this approach can be further developed to study the occurrence, formation, and transports of nanoplastics in the natural environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Exposure may occur by ingestion, inhalation and dermal contact due to the presence of microplastics in products, foodstuff and air. In all biological systems, microplastic exposure may cause particle toxicity, with oxidative stress, inflammatory lesions and increased uptake or translocation. The inability of the immune system to remove synthetic particles may lead to chronic inflammation and increase risk of neoplasia. Furthermore, microplastics may release their constituents, adsorbed contaminants and pathogenic organisms. Nonetheless, knowledge on microplastic toxicity is still limited and largely influenced by exposure concentration, particle properties, adsorbed contaminants, tissues involved and individual susceptibility, requiring further research.

Both PS and PMMA exposures resulted in significant concentration-related increase of developmental defects and of microplastic uptake in plutei. Moreover, embryo exposures to PS and PMMA (5 and 50 mg L-1) from 10 min to 5 h p-f resulted in a significant increase of cytogenetic abnormalities, expressed as significantly increased mitotic aberrations, while mitotoxicity (as % embryos lacking active mitoses) was observed in embryos exposed to PS, though not to PMMA. When S. granularis sperm suspensions were exposed for 10 min to PS or to PMMA (0.1-5 mg L-1), a significant decrease of fertilisation success was observed following sperm exposure to 0.1 mg L-1 PS, though not to higher PS concentrations nor to PMMA. Sperm pretreatment, however, resulted in significant offspring damage, as excess developmental defects in plutei, both following sperm exposure to PS and PMMA, thus suggesting transmissible damage from sperm pronuclei to the offspring.

Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and fluorescent perylene tetraester (PTE) dye were used to prepare highly fluorescent nanoplastic particles. At concentrations of 25 ppm, the PMMA particles showed no detrimental impact on barnacle larvae and their microalgae feed, Tetraselmis suecica and Chaetoceros muelleri. PMMA nanoplastics were ingested and translocated inside the body of the barnacle nauplii within the first 3 h of incubation. The fluorescent PMMA particles inside the transparent nauplius were tracked using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Subsequently, the nanoplastics were fed to the barnacle nauplii under two conditions acute and chronic exposure. The results from acute exposure show that nanoplastics persist in the body throughout stages of growth and development from nauplius to cyprid and juvenile barnacle. Some egestion of nanoplastics was observed through moulting and fecal excrement. In comparison, chronic exposure demonstrates bioaccumulation of the nanoplastics even at low concentrations of the plastics. The impacts of our study using PMMA nanopartides exceeds current knowledge, where most studies stop at uptake and ingestion. Here we demonstrate that uptake of nanopartides during planktonic larval stages may persist to the adult stages, indicating potential for the long-term impacts of nanoplastics on sessile invertebrate communities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

After 3 days of exposure to 1.0 mg L-1 polystyrene particles of the five sizes, the 1.0 m group had the lowest survival rate, the largest decrease in body length and the shortest average lifespan in nematodes. We demonstrated that exposure to N/MPs accelerated the frequency of body bending and head thrashing, and increased crawling speed, which indicate that N/MPs can induce size-dependent excitatory toxicity on locomotor behavior. Of the five sizes of N/MPs, 1.0 m particles significantly downregulated the expression of unc-17 and unc-47, and resulted in obvious damage to cholinergic and GABAergic neurons. We also found that polystyrene N/MPs significantly elevated the expression of gst-4, which encodes glutathione S-transferase-4, a key enzyme in oxidative stress. Additionally, N/MPs-induced oxidative damage was effectively attenuated by natural antioxidants, curcumin and oligometric proanthocyanidins.

Multistakeholder discussions can provide an important element in helping to identify and prioritize key knowledge gaps in assessing potential risks. In the present review, we summarize multistakeholder discussions from a 1-d International Council of Chemical Associations-sponsored symposium, which involved 39 scientists from 8 countries with representatives from academia, industry, and government. Participants were asked to consider the following: discuss the scientific merits and limitations of applying a proposed conceptual environmental risk assessment (ERA) framework for microplastic particles and identify and prioritize major research needs in applying ERA tools for microplastic particles. Multistakeholder consensus was obtained with respect to the interpretation of the current state of the science related to effects and exposure to microplastic particles, which implies that it is unlikely that the presence of microplastic in the environment currently represents a risk. However, the quality and quantity of existing data require substantial improvement before conclusions regarding the potential risks and impacts of microplastic particles can be fully assessed.

Through varying the anion and the side chain at the cation, the interactions between the extractant and the polymer can be strengthened and tuned, and thereby the disintegration of the particle into separate polymer chains can be controlled. Oxidized moieties can also be efficiently solvated, given the amphiphilic nature of the considered ionic liquids, allowing also realistic particles to be extracted into these solvents. The phase transfer was found to be thermodynamically and kinetically possible, which is supported by the complicated structure of the ionic liquid-water interface through the rearrangement of the interfacial ions, and the formation of a micelle around the plastic already at the edge of the aqueous phase.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Their versatility, stability, light weight, and low production costs have fueled global demand. Most plastics are initially used and discarded on land. Nonetheless, the amount of microplastics in some oceanic compartments is predicted to double by 2030. To solve this global problem, we must understand plastic composition, physical forms, uses, transport, and fragmentation into microplastics (and nanoplastics). Plastic debris/microplastics arise from land disposal, wastewater treatment, tire wear, paint failure, textile washing, and at-sea losses. Riverine and atmospheric transport, storm water, and disasters facilitate releases. In surface waters plastics/microplastics weather, biofoul, aggregate, and sink, are ingested by organisms and redistributed by currents. Ocean sediments are likely the ultimate destination. Plastics release additives, concentrate environmental contaminants, and serve as substrates for biofilms, including exotic and pathogenic species. Microplastic abundance increases as fragment size decreases, as does the proportion of organisms capable of ingesting them. Particles <20 mu m may penetrate cell membranes, exacerbating risks. Exposure can compromise feeding, metabolic processes, reproduction, and behavior. But more investigation is required to draw definitive conclusions. Human ingestion of contaminated seafood and water is a concern. Microplastics indoors present yet uncharacterized risks, magnified by the time we spend inside (>90%) and the abundance of polymeric products therein. Scientific challenges include improving microplastic sampling and characterization approaches, understanding long-term behavior, additive bioavailability, and organismal and ecosystem health risks. Solutions include improving globally based pollution prevention, developing degradable polymers and additives, and reducing consumption/expanding plastic reuse.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the USA defines microplastics as plastics of size < 5 mm-1 nm. To solve the problem of microplastic pollution, it is essential to track its source. As plastics are pervasive, it is challenging to track its source with a level of certainty required for implementing control strategies. Formulating and adopting suitable environmental forensic techniques to track microplastic pollution become important in this context. This study quantified the microplastic pollution of the Nattika coast, Kerala, India, and devised an environmental forensic investigation strategy for identifying the pathways and sources of microplastics. The microplastics of size 5-1 mm only were considered. The number of microplastics found in the Nattika Beach in 2017 and 2018 was 70.15 items kg(-1) of sand and 120.85 items kg(-1) of sand, respectively. The microplastics were subjected to analysis in FTIR and SEM as part of characterization. The forensic investigation of the pollution indicated that majority of the microplastic is sourced from the site/nearby area. The investigation could draw useful conclusions regarding the pathways of pollution. The fibrous microplastic, a significant component in the sample, was found to be sourced from the fishing net mending activities carried out close to the shore.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Of the 6.3 billion tonnes of fossil fuel-derived plastic (FFP) waste produced to date, only 9% has been recycled; the rest being incinerated (12%) or dumped into the environment (79%). FFPs take centuries to degrade, meaning five billion tonnes of increasingly fragmented and dangerous plastics have accumulated in our oceans, soil and air. Rates of FFP production and waste are growing rapidly, driven by increased demand and shifting strategies of oil and gas companies responding to slowing profit growth. Without effective recycling, the harm caused by FFP waste will keep increasing, jeopardizing first marine life and ultimately humankind. In this Perspective article, we review the global costs of plastic pollution and explain why solving this is imperative for humanity's well-being. We show that FFP pollution is far beyond a marine environmental issue: it now invades our bodies, causing disease and dysfunction, while millions of adults and children work in conditions akin to slavery, picking through our waste. We argue that an integrated economic and technical solution, catalyzed through a voluntary industry-led contribution from new FFP production, is central to arrest plastic waste flows by making used plastic a cashable commodity, incentivizing recovery and accelerating industrialization of polymer-to-polymer technologies. Without much-needed systematic transformation, driven by a contribution from FFP production, humanity and the oceans face a troubling future.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The average density of microplastics ranged from 80 to 480 particles/kg dry weight sand. There was no apparent seasonal difference but there were significant spatial differences among sampling sites. No significant difference in microplastic levels was observed among the west, south, and east coasts, but microplastic density was higher on beaches with higher tourism activity levels. The most abundant type of microplastics was fiber (> 97%) and the most common color was white/transparent (57%). In addition, using a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer we identified microplastics as polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP).

The assimilation kinetics of microplastics particles was assessed in different organs (gills, digestive gland and flesh) using three different protocols (direct observation, H2O2, and HNO3/HCl digestion) in order to compare method's efficacity. The main biological endpoints studied were Aceylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition as a neurotoxicity biomarker, the Catalase (CAT) enzymatic activity and the Gluthation-S-Transfereases (GSTs) activities as oxidative stress and phase II detoxification phase markers, respectively. Results showed that the H2O2 digestion method was more efficient to assess particles assimilation than the direct observation and acid digestion. In all cases no particles were detected in clam's flesh and gills were the first target organ for micro-plastics accumulation. The exposure of Donax truculus to PP/PE mixture (0.06 g/Kg of sand) induce a significant inhibition of AChE activity in both gills and digestive gland and oxidative stress in all organs studied.

This review summarizes the results of cutting-edge research about the interactions between a range of aquatic species and microplastics, including effects on biota physiology and secondary ingestion. Uptake pathways via digestive or ventilatory systems are discussed, including (1) the physical penetration of microplastic particles into cellular structures, (2) leaching of chemical additives or adsorbed persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and (3) consequences of bacterial or viral microbiota contamination associated with microplastic ingestion. Following uptake, a number of individual-level effects have been observed, including reduction of feeding activities, reduced growth and reproduction through cellular modifications, and oxidative stress. Microplastic-associated effects on marine biota have become increasingly investigated with growing concerns regarding human health through trophic transfer. We argue that research on the cellular interactions with microplastics provide an understanding of their impact to the organisms' fitness and, therefore, its ability to sustain their functional role in the ecosystem. The review summarizes information from 236 scientific publications. Of those, only 4.6% extrapolate their research of microplastic intake on individual species to the impact on ecosystem functioning.

With a mean annual salt consumption of similar to 3.75 kg/year, humans therefore annually ingest several hundred microplastic particles from salt alone.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Based on the research literature on microplastics in recent years, this paper reviews the research progress of microplastics in freshwater sediments in China, discusses several commonly used methods of sampling, separation, and detection of microplastics in freshwater sediments, summarizes the distribution characteristics of microplastics in freshwater sediments in China, analyzes the toxicological effects of microplastics, and introduces the degradation methods of microplastics.

However, data on microplastic effluent concentrations in WWTPs is collected with a broad range of methods, which impede comparisons across data sets. We provide an estimate of the annual emissions of microplastic partides by WWTPs into the ten major river basins of Germany. We analyze the concentration patterns of microplastics among different stream orders resulting from the spatial organization of WWTPs along the river network. The local in-stream microplastic concentrations are estimated through a network model that accounts for routing of microplastics through the entire fluvial network under the assumption of no losses by sedimentation, entanglement or degradation. Previous studies have observed microplastic concentrations in treated WWTPs effluents ranging several orders of magnitude. In 19 studies reviewed (2016-2020), the concentrations of observed microplastic concentrations (size range between 10 and 5000 mu m) in 79 WWTP effluents ranged between 4 * 10(0) and 4.5 = 10(5) items/m(3) with a median of around 6400 items/m(3). The total, median microplastic load emitted by WWTPs in Germany is 7 * 10(12) items/year. The simulated microplastic concentrations, on average, tend to increase with increasing stream order suggesting that the WWTP effluent fraction accumulates with a higher rate than discharge. Simulated WWTP-derived in-stream concentrations are higher than observed concentrations with all sources of microplastic, not only those from WWTP's. Observed microplastic concentrations in rivers as well as the considerably higher simulated, WWTP-derived microplastic concentration, even for low flow conditions, are approximately one order of magnitude below currently known toxic effect levels.

Todd",,,,,"Dams are known to trap pollutants such as metals and PCBs in the sediment that accumulates within their reservoirs. As more attention is paid to microplastics, an emerging contaminant in waterways worldwide, and how they move along rivers, whether microplastic particles also accumulate behind dams is an important question for informing estimates of global river inputs to oceans. In this study, we measured microplastic concentrations above, below, and within the reservoirs of six dams near Ithaca, NY USA. Samples were processed following the wet peroxide oxidation method and visual counting, followed by Raman Spectroscopy validation. We found that microplastic concentrations in sediment within reservoirs was significantly higher than in sediment above the dams (p = 0.005), and in water samples, concentrations within reservoirs was significantly lower (p = 0.02). Plastic fibers were the dominant plastic type, but in within-reservoir sediment samples, less abundant plastic types such as plastic fragments were found in higher proportions. These results show that the sediment collecting behind dams is one sink for microplastics in river systems at long timescales, indicating that accounting for dams may be important when modeling global riverine microplastic transport.

We kept 64 female hermit crabs in tanks containing either polyethylene spheres (n = 35) or no plastic (n = 29) for 5 days. We then transferred subjects into suboptimal shells and placed them in an observation tank with an optimal alternative shell. Plastic-exposed hermit crabs showed impaired shell selection: they were less likely than controls to contact optimal shells or enter them. They also took longer to contact and enter the optimal shell. Plastic exposure did not affect time spent investigating the optimal shell. These results indicate that microplastics impair cognition (information-gathering and processing), disrupting an essential survival behaviour in hermit crabs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

The proposed method confirmed its potential for clear identification of polyethylene, polypropylene, acrylonitrile, polyamides and cellulose-based fibers, but more difficulties when the filter substrate neighboring the fibers exhibits intense absorptions in the 1800-1000 cm(-1) range.

The highest pollution occurred on the North-Western shelf where the abundance of MPs was 10 times higher than in sediments from the deep sea. The most abundant plastic polymers were polyethylene and polypropylene, followed by acrylate and acrylonitrile copolymers. Polyamide and cellulose-based textile fibers were also found.

This study focuses on developing an efficient method for the preparation of micro-sized EPS foams for research purposes and compares it with previous microplastics preparation methods reported in 68 previous studies. It was demonstrated that the iced EPS block method (iced EPS block + water) generated larger quantities of smaller-sized EPS foams (20-200 and 200-500 mu m) compared to the EPS + ice + water and EPS + water methods. The optimal protocol includes 1) iced EPS block preparation, 2) grinding and sieving, and 3) collecting. Additionally, it was confirmed that the iced EPS block method requires less money, labor, and time compared to previously reported methods in the literature.

However, the current approaches to monitoring and modeling fluvial transport of microplastic pollution have primarily relied on sampling the surface of flow and assumptions about microplastic concentration depth profiles to estimate the depth-averaged concentration. The Rouse profile was adapted to show that fluvial transport of microplastic pollution includes all traditional domains of transport (bed load, settling suspended load, and wash load), as well as additional domains specific to low-density materials with rising velocities in water (rising suspended load and surface load). The modified Rouse profile was applied to describe the positively buoyant particle concentration depth profiles and compared to field observations to showcase the utility of this approach. A procedure was developed for assessing the uncertainty and bias from using a surface sample to estimate the depth-averaged concentration while assuming either surface load or wash load concentration depth profiles. Both assumptions may introduce a large amount of uncertainty due to the range of suspended microplastic concentration depth profiles. Monitoring microplastic pollution and estimating the depth-averaged concentration of microplastics in fluvial systems would further benefit from broader adoption of depth-integrated sampling, characterization of particle concentration depth profiles, and estimation of uncertainties in depth-averaged concentration based on the sampling approach.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Besides aquatic and terrestrial environments, this also includes aquatic species intended for human consumption and several studies have reported their prevalence in other food products and beverages. The scientific as well as public debate has therefore increasingly focused on human health implications of microplastic exposure. However, there is a big discrepancy between the magnitude of this debate and actual scientific findings, which have merely shown the presence of microplastics in certain products. While plastics can undoubtedly be hazardous to human health due to toxicity of associated chemicals or as a consequence of particle toxicity, the extent to which microplastics in individual food products and beverages contribute to this is debatable. Considering the enormous use of plastic materials in our everyday lives, microplastics from food products and beverages likely only constitute a minor exposure pathway for plastic particles and associated chemicals to humans. But as this is rarely put into perspective, the recent debate has created a skewed picture of human plastic exposure. We risk pulling the focus away from the root of the problem: the way in which we consume, use and dispose of plastics leading to their widespread presence in our everyday life and in the environment. Therefore we urge for a more careful and balanced discussion which includes these aspects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the amount of microfibers shedding from synthetic textiles was measured for three materials (acrylic, nylon, polyester), knit using different gauges and techniques. All textiles were found to shed, but polyester fleece fabrics shed the greatest amounts, averaging 7360 fibers/m(-2)/L-1 in one wash, compared with polyester fabrics which shed 87 fibers/m(-2)/L-1. We found that loose textile constructions shed more, as did worn fabrics, and high twist yarns are to be preferred for shed reduction. Since fiber from clothing is a potentially important source of microplastics, we suggest that smarter textile construction, prewashing and vacuum exhaustion at production sites, and use of more efficient filters in household washing machines could help mitigate this problem.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Plastic particulates break down into smaller fragments in the environment, and these small pieces are now commonly found to be ingested by animals. To date, most plastic ingestion studies have focused on assessing retained plastics or regurgitated plastics, but it is likely that animals also excrete plastic and other debris items. We examined the terminal portion of the gastrointestinal tract of a seabird known to commonly ingest plastics, the Northern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), to determine if seabirds excrete microplastics and other debris via their guano. We also examine how guano collections may be used as an indicator of retained plastics. The frequency of occurrence of microplastics did not correlate between the gut and faecal precursor samples, but there was a positive relationship between the number of pieces of plastics in the gut and the number of microplastics in the guano. Our findings suggest that seabirds are acting as vectors of microplastics and debris in the marine environment where their guano accumulates around their colonies.

Furthermore, the protocol from compromising results between two phases was optimized by an orthogonal experiment to determine the best operating conditions. Then, an application of the optimization protocol to investigate microplastics pollution in commercial clams was conducted. According to our results, 10% KOH showed fairly well digestion efficiency and little effect on identification of the tested microplastics. Furthermore, best operating conditions were demonstrated as treating clam tissues with 1:5 (M: V) of 10% KOH solution, incubating at 60 degrees C, shaking at 30 rpm for 12 h. In China, commercial clams were found contaminated with widespread microplastics pollution (3.50 +/- 1.35 items/g).

Most microplastic studies focus on spatial trends in concentration, but in systems as dynamic as rivers, to draw conclusions from existing spatial studies, we must first examine how microplastic concentrations may change with time and flow conditions. In this study, we investigate how microplastic concentrations change over a 24-h period and between seasonally high and low flows. We do this in two streams, controlling for wastewater treatment strategy: one stream in a watershed where waste is treated with septic systems and the other receiving wastewater treatment plant effluent. We hypothesized that a stream with wastewater treatment plant effluent would exhibit higher and more variable microplastic concentrations than a stream in a watershed with septic systems. Results indicate, however, that there is no significant difference between the two streams despite their differing treatment strategies. Additionally, no significant variation in concentrations was measured over two 24-h sampling campaigns. There was, however, significantly higher concentrations measured in summer low flow conditions relative to spring high flow conditions across both sampled streams (p value < 0.001), indicating that increases in stream discharge unrelated to storm events dilute and decrease measured microplastic concentrations. From this, we learn that pairing measured concentrations with a description of flow conditions at sampling time is a requisite for a robust microplastic literature that allows for comparisons between existing spatial studies and extrapolations to global loads.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

We conducted a review covering image analysis from optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and spectral analysis from Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, pyrolysis gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. These techniques were commonly used to collect, process, and interpret data from microplastic samples. This review outlined and critiques current approaches for analysis steps in image processing (color, thresholding, particle quantification), spectral processing (background and baseline subtraction, smoothing and noise reduction, data transformation), image classification (reference libraries, morphology, color, and fluorescence intensity), and spectral classification (reference libraries, matching procedures, and best practices for developing in-house reference tools). We highlighted opportunities to advance microplastic data analysis and interpretation by (i) quantifying colors, shapes, sizes, and surface topologies with image analysis software, (ii) identifying threshold values of particle characteristics in images that distinguish plastic particles from other particles, (iii) advancing spectral processing and classification routines, (iv) creating and sharing robust spectral libraries, (v) conducting double blind and negative controls, (vi) sharing raw data and analysis code, and (vii) leveraging readily available data to develop machine learning classification models. We identified analytical needs that we could fill and developed supplementary information for a reference library of plastic images and spectra, a tutorial for basic image analysis, and a code to download images from peer reviewed literature. Our major findings were that research on microplastics was progressing toward the use of multiple analytical methods and increasingly incorporating chemical classification.

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of polyethylene microplastic beads (PE MP) on accumulation and associated oxidative stress responses attributed to fluoranthene (Flu) in blue mussels, Mytilus edulis. Blue mussels were exposed for 96h to four treatment groups: Flu-only, MP-only, Flu and MP coexposure, and Flu-incubated MP. Treatments were conducted at a low and high concentration (50g/L and 100 Flu g/L and 100, and 1000MP/mL). Results demonstrated that in both the gill and digestive gland, coexposure did not markedly affect Flu uptake, but this treatment significantly decreased tissue Flu concentrations. Antioxidant responses including activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidases (GPx), and levels of total glutathione (GSH) in both gills and digestive glands were significantly altered suggesting a perturbation of redox state induced by the exposure conditions. Although individual biomarkers varied, the biomarker profile enabled certain generalizations to be made. Antioxidant responses occurred more likely in gill tissue than in digestive gland. Individual contaminant exposures to Flu or MP led to varying responses, but coexposures and incubated exposures did not result in additive or synergistic effects. Exposure concentrations (i.e., low or high treatments) were not a consistent a predictor of response; and the internal Flu dose did not consistently predict outcome of various biomarkers. Importantly, MP-only exposure appeared to be capable of eliciting direct effects on the oxidative stress system as demonstrated by the activities of CAT and GPx. These findings warrant further investigation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

We examined the effects of two polymer mixtures on the morphology, life history and on the molecular level of the waterflea Daphnia magna (three different clones). Microplastic particles of similar to 40 mu m were supplied at a low concentration (1% of the food particles) leading to an average of similar to 30 particles in the digestive tract which reflects a high microplastic contamination but still resembles a natural situation. Neither increased mortality nor changes on the morphological (body length, width and tail spine length) or reproductive parameters were observed for adult Daphnia. The analyses of juvenile Daphnia revealed a variety of small and rather subtle responses of morphological traits (body length, width and tail spine length). For adult Daphnia, alterations in expression of genes related to stress responses (i.e. HSP60, HSP70 & GST) as well as of other genes involved in body function and body composition (i.e. SERCA) were observed already 48h after exposure. We anticipate that the adverse effects of microplastic might be influenced by many additional factors like size, shape, type and even age of the particles and that the rather weak effects, as detected in a laboratory, may lead to reduced fitness in a natural multi-stressor environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

As widely used pesticides, triazole fungicides with potential environmental and human safety risks often coexist with MPs in the environment. Understanding the adsorption behavior is the basis of risk assessment of co-exposure of MPs and triazole fungicides. In this study, the adsorption behavior of three commonly used triazole fungicides on polystyrene (PS) was studied using adsorption test. The influences of PS particle size and environmental factors on adsorption capacity were evaluated, and the adsorption mechanisms were discussed. Results suggested that the adsorption kinetics and isotherm conformed to the Pseudo-second-order and Freundlich model, respectively. The order of adsorption and desorption capacity was hexaconazole (HEX) N myclobutanil (MYC) N triadimenol (TRI), which was positively correlated with LogKow of pesticides. To a certain extent, the decrease in PS particle size and change in solution pH value and increase in salt ion strength all contribute to increasing adsorption capacity. The main mechanisms of adsorption were hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. MPs can adsorb and may become the source and sink of triazole fungicides in aqueous environments. Our results demonstrate that more attention should be given to the combined water pollution risk of MPs and triazoles fungicides. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

M.",,,,,"Plastic pollution is recognized as a severe anthropogenic issue in the coastal and marine ecosystems across the world. Unprecedented and continuous accumulation of growing plastic contaminants into any respective aquatic ecosystem by the anthropogenic sources causes direct and/or indirect interruption to ecosystem structure, functions, and consequently, services and values. Land-based and sea-based sources are the primary sources of these contaminants in various modes that enter the ocean. In this review paper, we focused on highlighting different aspects related to plastic pollution in coastal and marine environments. Plastic pollutants are distributed in the ecosystems in different forms, with different size variations as megaplastic, macroplastic, mesoplastic, and microplastic. Microplastics in primary and secondary forms reveal a widespread distribution in the water, sediment, and biota of the marine and coastal habitats. The microplastic level of different coastal and marine ecosystems nearly ranged from 0.001-140 particles/m(3) in water and 0.2-8766 particles/m(3) in sediments at different aquatic environments over the world. The microplastic accumulation rate of coastal and marine organisms varied at 0.1-15,033 counts. Accordingly, plastic pollution creates several kinds of negative consequences combined with ecological and socio-economic effects. Entanglement, toxicological effects via ingestion of plastics, suffocation, starvation, dispersal, and rafting of organisms, provision of new habitats, and introduction of invasive species are significant ecological effects with growing threats to biodiversity and trophic relationships. Degradation (changes in the ecosystem state) and modifications of marine systems are associated with loss of ecosystem services and values. Consequently, this emerging contaminant affects the socio-economic aspects through negative impacts on tourism, fishery, shipping, and human health. Preventing accumulation sources of plastic pollutants, 3Rs (Reduce Recycle-Reuse), awareness & capacity building, and producer/manufacturer responsibility are practical approaches toward addressing the issue of plastic pollution. Existing and adopted policies, legislations, regulations, and initiatives at global, regional, and national level play a vital role in reducing plastic debris in the marine and coastal zones. Development of proposals/solutions on key research gaps can open a novel pathway to address this environmental issue in an effective scientific manner. In conclusion, this paper demonstrates the current status of plastic pollution in the marine ecosystem to make aware people of a plastic-free, healthy blue ocean in the near future.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Environmental monitoring studies detected microplastic items in every tested water body and found them in various aquatic organisms. Yet, many studies conducted so far, refer to microplastic particles and spheres but not fibers. Microplastic fibers are often not considered due to methodological issues and high contamination risk during sampling and analysis. Only a few of the microplastic exposure studies with aquatic organisms were conducted with microplastic fibers. Recent effect studies demonstrated several negative impacts of microplastic fibers on aquatic organisms, which include tissue damage, reduced growth, and body condition and even mortality. Such negative effects were predominantly observed in taxa at the basis of the food chain. Higher taxa were less heavily affected in direct exposure experiments, but they presumably suffer from negative effects on organisms at lower food chain levels in the wild. Consequently, ongoing and future pollution with microplastic fibers may disturb the functioning of aquatic ecosystems.

In parallel, 13 plastic additives and 27 hydrophobic organic compounds (HOC) were quantified in bivalves flesh using SBSE-TD-GS-MS/MS to explore a possible relationship between their concentrations and MP contamination levels. MP were extracted using a 10% potassium hydroxide digestion method then identified by mu-Raman spectroscopy. The proportion of contaminated bivalves by MP ranged from 34 to 58%. Blue mussels and common cockles exhibited 0.76 +/- 0.40 and 2.46 +/- 1.16 MP/individual and between 0.15 +/- 0.06 and 0.74 +/- 035 MP/g of tissue wet weight. Some HOC and plastic additives were detected in bivalves. However, no significant Pearson or Spearman correlation was found between MP loads and plastic additives or HOC concentrations in bivalve tissues for the two species. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, currently available polymer-based membranes are low in porosity and relatively thick, resulting in a limited permeability and unrealistic culture conditions. In this study, we developed an ultrathin, nanoporous alumina membrane as novel cell culture interface for vertebrate cells, with focus on the rainbow trout (Onchorynchus mykiss) intestinal cell line RTgutGC. The new type of membrane is framed in a silicon chip for physical support and has a thickness of only 1 mu m, with a porosity of 15% and homogeneous nanopores (empty set = 73 +/- 21 nm). Permeability rates for small molecules, namely lucifer yellow, dextran 40, and bovine serum albumin, exceeded those of standard polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membranes by up to 27 fold. With the final goal to establish a representative model of the fish intestine for environmental toxicology, we engineered a simple culture setup, capable of testing the cellular response toward chemical exposure. Herein, cells were cultured in a monolayer on the alumina membranes and formed a polarized epithelium with apical expression of the tight junction protein ZO-1 within 14 days. Impedance spectroscopy, a noninvasive and real time electrical measurement, was used to determine cellular resistance during epithelial layer formation and chemical exposure to evaluate barrier functionality. Resistance values during epithelial development revealed different stages of epithelial maturity and were comparable with the in vivo situation. During chemical exposure, cellular resistance changed immediately when barrier tightness or cell viability was affected. Thus, our study demonstrates nanoporous alumina membranes as promising novel interface for alternative in vitro approaches, capable of allowing cell culture in a physiologically realistic manner and enabling high quality microscopy and sensitive measurement of cellular resistance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,3 - Intervention",,

Studies to date have disregarded the potential fact that microplastics are generally contaminated before their entry into soil. In this study, earthworm Eisenia fetida was incubated for 28 d in a soil amended with five common types of microplastics precontaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to elucidate contaminant transfer. Accumulation of HOCs in E. fetida varied greatly among different plastic types and HOCs. The freely dissolved concentration (C-free) of HOCs showed that desorption of HOCs from microplastics into soil was closely related to plastic types and HOC hydrophobicity and was much slower for polystyrene or polypropylene than polyethylene. Biodynamic model analysis suggested that ingestion of microplastics could act as a significant pathway for some microplastics, likely due to HOCs on the plastics being in an ""over-equilibrium"" state. This was in contrast with mixing clean microplastics into HOC-contaminated soil, where the microplastics decreased bioaccumulation. Therefore, whether microplastics serve as facilitators or inhibitors of HOC bioaccumulation depends on the fugacity gradient of HOCs between microplastics and soil, which highlights the importance of considering the sequence of contamination between the plastics and soil. These findings also question the validity of short-term experiments because of the generally very slow partition kinetics of HOCs on plastics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

In the present review, information on the ingestion of plastic debris of varying sizes is collated, including data for >800 species representing approximately 87 000 individual organisms, for which plastic debris and microplastic particles have been observed in approximately 17 500, or 20%. The average reported number of microplastic particles/individual across all studies is estimated to be 4, with studies typically reporting averages ranging from 0 to 10 particles/individual. A general observation is that although strong evidence exists for the biological ingestion of microplastic particles, they do not bioaccumulate and do not appear to be subject to biomagnification as a result of trophic transfer through food webs, with >99% of observations from field-based studies reporting that microplastic particles are located within the gastrointestinal tract. Overall, there is substantial heterogeneity in how samples are collected, processed, analyzed, and reported, causing significant challenges in attempting to assess temporal and spatial trends or helping to inform a mechanistic understanding. Nevertheless, several studies suggest that the characteristics of microplastic particles ingested by organisms are generally representative of plastic debris in the vicinity where individuals are collected. Monitoring of spatial and temporal trends of ingested microplastic particles could thus potentially be useful in assessing mitigation efforts aimed at reducing the emission of plastic and microplastic particles to the environment.

In the present review, we summarized the adverse effects of different size, concentrations and types of microplastics on animals' antioxidative system, energy metabolism and nervous system. Results showed that microplastics can: induce oxidative damage (increased lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breaks); alter antioxidative system (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase were parameters with the highest and significant changes in activities) and metabolism (isocitrate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase activity); and have neurotoxic effects (inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity). The effects were depending on size and dose of used microplastics, and/or their interaction with other xenobiotics.

Water samples were collected by a manta trawl, and sediment samples were collected by a Van Veen grab sampler. The average number and concentration of MPs in water samples were 80 +/- 65 items/m(3) and 53.3 +/- 58.4 mg/m(3), respectively. The average number and concentration of MPs in sediment samples were 91 +/- 13 items/kg and 4.9 +/- 3.4 mg/kg, respectively. The main morphologies of MPs were fragments and fibers, mostly white. Polypropylene (PP) was the dominant polymer type found in both water and sediment. Moreover, the content of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb) on MPs was extracted by aqua regia solution and analyzed by ICP-OES. Results show high concentrations of Pb and Cu adsorbed on MPs in the study area.

The immune related protein beta-GBP was purified from the haemolymph of P. pelagicus using Sephadex G-100 affinity column chromatography. Pp beta-GBP-ZnO NPs was physico-chemically characterized and experimental feed was formulated. Fish were separately fed with commercial diet (control-group I) and Pp beta-GBP (group II, III, IV), Pp beta-GBP-ZnO NPs (group V, VI, VII), chem-ZnO NPs (VIII, IX, X) mixed diet at the concentration of 0.001%, 0.002% and 0.004% respectively. Triplicate groups of O. mossambicus were fed with experimental diets twice a day for 30 days.

Cellular immune responses (myeloperoxidase activity, lysozyme activity and reactive oxygen species activity) and humoral immune responses (complement activity, antiprotease activity and alkaline phosphatase activity) were evaluated at an interval of 15 days during the feeding trial. Results demonstrate that both cellular and humoral immune responses were substantially increased (P < 0.05) in fish fed with 0.004% of Pp beta-GBP-ZnO NPs supplemented diet than others. Antibiofilm potential of Pp beta-GBP-ZnO NPs against Aeromonas hydrophila was visualized through confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which reveals reduction in the preformed biofilm thickness to 10 mu m at the concentration of 50 mu g/ml. Furthermore, after 30 days of feeding trial, fish were challenged with aquatic fish pathogen A. hydrophila (1 x 10(7) cells ml(-1)) through intraperitoneal injection. Challenge study displayed a reduced mortality rate in fish fed with diet containing Pp beta-GBP-ZnO NPs.

At three sites on the coast of Para, Brazil, anemones were collected from beachrocks in the intertidal zone (30 at each site), measured (pedal disc diameter, mm) and weighed (wet weight, g). The contents of the gastrovascular cavity were extracted and analyzed under a stereoscope. The recovered plastic particles were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Overall, 139 microplastic and 2 mesoplastic items were identified in 68 individuals (75.6%) among the 90 examined, with a mean of 1.6 (+/- 1.5) items per individual. Plastic fibers comprised about 84% of the ingested plastics, followed by fragments (similar to 12%) and films (similar to 4%). Particle diameters ranged from 0.10 to 9.17 mm (1.57 +/- 1.23 mm). A weak positive correlation was found between the weight of anemones and the number of plastic particles in the gastrovascular cavity (p = 0.03) and between the number of prey items and the number of plastic particles in the gastrovascular cavity (p < 0.01). The main polymers identified by FTIR analysis were polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polyamide (PA), polyurethane (PU), polyethylene (PE), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polystyrene (PS) and rayon. Sea anemones ingested significantly more plastic debris at the most urbanized and populous sampling sites. This study provides the first evidence of microplastics contamination of marine invertebrates from the Amazon coast. Abundant species such as B. cangicum have the potential to monitor the levels of plastic contamination in the region. Our results support this potential, as the species showed a high frequency of plastic ingestion and allowed detection of plastic contamination even in the best-preserved area where anemones were collected.

The protocols to be tested were selected based on the literature: 10% KOH at 40 degrees C for 24 h; 10% KOH at 60 et for 24 h; diluted NaClO at room temperature (similar to 20 degrees C) for 15 h; 30% H2O2 at 40 degrees C for 48 h: Fenton's reagent with 30% H2O2 for 2 h at room temperature (similar to 20 degrees C). The fibers were characterized before and after digestion. The effects of those protocols on fibers integrity have been assessed using several of their performance parameters. High degradations were observed for PET with 10% KOH 60 et whereas almost no impact was observed at 40 degrees C. H2O2 digestion affects mechanical properties of different fibers, particularly PA 6.6. Both protocols should be avoided for synthetic fibers analyses. NaClO digestion mainly affected flax and viscose. Diluted NaClO at room temperature for 15 h, 10% KOH at 40 degrees C for 24 h and Fenton's reagent are more appropriate to maintain fibers integrity.

Upon hydration, the mucilage of chia seeds were able to capture PVC microplastics with sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of micrometers. Since PVC microplastics contained di-2-etylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) as a plasticizer (verified via Fourier transform infrared spectrometry), DEHP was used as an indicator in the subsequent quantification via gas chromatography e mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Specifically after verifying the DEHP peak in the GC spectrum using DEHP reference standard as a positive control, the GC spectral area of that peak was used to quantify the amount of DEHP in the sample. Using nominal operation settings at 10 min and 1000 rpm with 100 mg of chia seeds, the separation efficiency could be improved by 5 times (500%) as compared to the absence of chia seeds. Furthermore, chia seeds were also compatible with simulated synthetic wastewater samples. Most importantly, the use of chia seeds did not interfere with GC-MS quantification protocol and accuracy. The result suggested the proposed method can be used as a simple screening tool of microplastics entering wastewater treatment plant, even though a series of follow-up studies are needed in future.

Scanning electron microscope was used to observe the dispersed behavior of the CuNP. When the CuNP content was less than 1.0 wt%, the CuNPs were well dispersed in these nanocomposite monofilaments, and the increase of crystallization rate, the breaking strength, and knot strength were observed by differential scanning calorimeter and tensile test. Therefore, nanocomposite monofilaments showed comparable properties at low CuNP contents. With increasing CuNP content, the width of tan delta peak and oEa for alpha-relaxation from dynamic mechanical analysis were increased, indicating more amorphous components near the crystalline regions. In addition, burst release of Cu ions in seawater was observed. The coupon tests demonstrated that CuNPs could significantly improve antibiofouling performance of CuNP/HDPE fishing netting.

Soil-dwelling organisms play a key role in modifying the soil system by constructing bio-pores, and these structural changes are potentially related to the behavior of plastic particles. In this study, we found that micro-sized plastic particles moved into bio-pores within seconds, and that this influx disrupted the movement of springtails (Lobella sokamensis). The springtails moved to avoid becoming trapped, and this behavior created bio-pores in the soil system. The influx of plastic particles into these cavities subsequently immobilized the springtails within.

Despite increased research on MPs in the last decade, their potential threat to freshwater ecosystems remains an open question. In the present study, the negative impacts of MPs were investigated on blood biochemical parameters in the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis). Pond turtles were distributed into three experimental groups (n = 9 for each group) and were fed diets containing 250, 500, and 1000 mg MPs (PE100 polyethylene) per kg of food for 30 days, and a control group fed with a standard uncontaminated diet. The results indicated that exposure to 500 and 1000 mg kg(-1) MPs caused a significant increase in the activities of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, and in the levels of cholesterol, glucose, creatinine, urea, and calcium (Ca+2) compared with the control group. On the contrary, the activity of gamma-glutamyl transferase and the levels of total protein, albumin, total immunoglobulins, and phosphorus were significantly reduced in E. orbicularis exposed to 500 and 1000 mg kg(-1) MPs when compared with the controls. In all the MP-exposed groups, the activity of lactate dehydrogenase and globulin and magnesium (Mg+2) levels were significantly reduced; while creatine phosphokinase and alkaline phosphatase activities were increased with respect to the control turtles. A significant decrease in triglyceride levels was reported in E. orbicularis exposed to 1000 mg kg(-1) MPs. MPs intake induced notable alterations in blood biochemical parameters of E. orbicularis. These results suggest that changes in the blood biochemical parameters could be an appropriate bio-indicator to evidence the existence of tissue damage in E. orbicularis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

The mass production and consumption of medication for the treatment of infectious diseases in human and animals have led to the ubiquity of antibiotics in the environment. We studied the single and joint effects of microplastics (1-m and 10-m polystyrene particles, PS) and roxithromycin (ROX) on Daphnia magna through the acute and sublethal toxicity tests. The 48-h median effective concentration (EC50) of 1-m and 10-m PS to D. magna was 66.97mg/L and 199.94mg/L, respectively, while the value of ROX was 20.28mg/L. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and the activities of four enzymatic biomarkers, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione S-transferase (GST), were further detected to assess the oxidative stress caused in D. magna caused. The results showed that 48-h exposure to PS (0.1mg/L) or ROX (0.01mg/L) alone activated the activities of CAT and GST and MDA levels. When compared with the ROX alone, the responses of GPx and MDA in D. magna co-exposed to 1-m PS were significantly decreased, while co-exposure to 10-m PS significantly decreased the responses of GST and MDA. Furthermore, the integrated biomarker response version 2 (IBRv2) analysis revealed that co-exposure to 1-m PS and ROX led to the strongest biological responses in D. magna.

However, the effect of MPs in natural environment on the locomotor performance of aquatic biota is still controversial. Therefore, this meta-analysis was conducted, involving 116 effect sizes from 2347 samples, to quantitatively evaluate the alteration in locomotor behavior of aquatic organisms induced by MPs at environmentally relevant concentrations (<= 1 mg/L, median = 0.125 mg/L). It was shown that MP exposure significantly inhibited the average speed and moved distance of aquatic organisms by 5% and 8% (p < 0.05), respectively, compared with the control, resulting in an obvious reduction of locomotor ability by 6% (p 0.05). Egger's test indicated that the results were stable without publication bias (p 0.05). The complex influence of MPs on the locomotor ability were characterized through random-effects meta-regression analyses, presenting size-, time-, concentration-dependent manners and multi-factors interactions. In addition, several physiological changes, including energy reserve reduction, metabolism disorder, gut microbiota dysbiosis, inflammation response, neurotoxic response, and oxidative stress, of aquatic organisms triggered by MP exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations were also provided, which might account for the MPs-induced locomotor activity decline.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: !,QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

This study is devoted to estimating the colloidal nanoparticle concentration within such drops by using the time-shift technique. The estimation is achieved using two different approaches. The first utilizes the signal strength generated by light scattering from the particles in the drop relative to reflective scattering from the undisturbed drop surface. The second approach monitors the attenuation of the portion of the time-shift signal generated by second-order refractive scattering, i.e. light which has passed twice through the drop. These methods have been simulated using previously developed light scattering codes based on Monte Carlo ray tracing. Corresponding experiments have been implemented to validate these two estimation methods. For this, colloidal drops were generated by mixing water with the polystyrene latex nanoparticles and varying the volume concentration. Good agreement between the experimental and simulation results has been achieved, indicating that the time-shift technique can be further developed to meet this measurement task.

However, the transportation mechanism and effect of aging process are poorly understood. This study systematically investigated the desorption mechanisms of pharmaceuticals from pristine and aged polystyrene (PS) MPs under simulated gastric and intestinal conditions of marine organisms. Results showed that the increased desorption in stomach mainly depended on the solubilization of pepsin to pharmaceuticals and the competition for sorption sites on MPs via pi-pi and hydrophobic interactions. However, high desorption in gut relied on the solubilization of intestinal components (i.e. bovine serum albumin (BSA) and bile salts (NaT)) and the competitive sorption of NaT since the enhanced solubility increased the partition of pharmaceuticals in aqueous phase. Aging process suppressed the desorption of pharmaceuticals because aging decreased hydrophobic and pi-pi interactions but increased electrostatic interaction between aged MPs and pharmaceuticals, which became less affected by gastrointestinal components. Risk assessment indicated that the MP-associated pharmaceuticals posed low risks to organisms, and warm-blooded organisms suffered relatively higher risks than cold-blooded ones. This study reveals important information to understand the ecological risks of co-existed MPs and pollutants in the environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The mean abundances of MP uptake by the benthos from all sites ranged from 0.02 to 0.46 items g(-1) wet weight (ww) or 0.04-1.67 items individual(-1), which were lower values than those found in other regions worldwide. The highest value appeared at the northernmost site, implying that the sea ice and the cold current represent possible transport mediums. Interestingly, the predator A. rubens ingested the maximum quantities of MPs, suggesting that the trophic transfer of MPs through benthic food webs may play a critical role. Fibers constituted the major type (87%) in each species, followed by film (13%). The colors of fibers were classified as red (46%) and transparent (41%), and the film was all gray.

Three connected laboratory experiments using the filter-feeding mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the omnivorous polichaete Hediste diversicolor were conducted to evaluate whether the filtering action by mussels affects the vertical transfer of MP of different sizes (MPSMALL = 41 mu m; MPLARGE = 129 mu m) and densities (polyamide = 1.15 g cm(-3); polypropylene = 0.92 g cm(-3)) across compartments and species with different feeding modes. Mussels significantly removed MP from the water column by incorporating them into biodeposits. This effect was particularly evident for the MPSMALL, whose deposition from the water column to the bottom was enhanced (about 15%) by the action of mussels. The incorporation of MP into faecal pellets increased the particles' sinking velocity by about 3-4 orders of magnitude. Conversely, the MP presence significantly decreased the depositional velocities of faecal pellets, and the magnitude of this effect was greater with increasing MP size and decreasing density. The MP incorporation into mussels' biodeposits also more than doubled the amount of MP uptake by H. diversicolor. We conclude that detrital pathways could be a transfer route of MP across marine compartments and food webs, potentially affecting the distribution of MP in sediments and creating hot-spots of bioavailable MP.

The presence of environmental corona as an eco-nano interface can significantly alter the bioavailability, biocompatibility, and toxicity of pristine ENMs to aquatic organisms. However, as an emerging field, research on the impact of the environmental corona on the fate and behavior of ENMs in aquatic environments is still in its infancy. To promote a deeper understanding of its importance in driving or moderating ENM toxicity, this study systemically recapitulates the literature of representative types of macromolecules that are adsorbed onto ENMs; these constitute the environmental corona, including NOM, EPS, proteins, and surfactants. Next, the ecotoxicological effects of environmental corona-coated ENMs on representative aquatic organisms at different trophic levels are discussed in comparison to pristine ENMs, based on the reported studies. According to this analysis, molecular mechanisms triggered by pristine and environmental corona-coated ENMs are compared, including membrane adhesion, membrane damage, cellular internalization, oxidative stress, immunotoxicity, genotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity. Finally, current knowledge gaps and challenges in this field are discussed from the ecotoxicology perspective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The reports on DMA sensing is in scarce and few reports that have been reported are at high temperature operation. Semiconducting metal-oxides are prominent material in chemical sensing due to its high sensitivity, faster response, and better stability. Hence, in the present work, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) chemi-resistive sensor was developed to detect DMA vapours at room temperature for the minimum concentration of about 5 ppm. V2O5 nanoparticles were synthesized using hydrothermal technique and its structural information has been obtained from X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles exhibited porous structure that have been observed using scanning electron microscopy. The DMA sensing studies have been carried out in a custom-made vapour sensing chamber at ambient temperature and relative humidity (25 degrees C and 37%) for various concentrations of DMA and its sensor response (S) was calculated. Selectivity studies have been performed for various vapours and found that the synthesized nanoparticles were highly selective towards DMA vapours.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Microplastics (MPs) are the predominant form of marine plastic debris, a form small enough to be ingested by and potentially harm marine organisms. It is urgent to develop ecologically relevant metrics for the risk assessment of MPs based on in situ data, especially for coastal areas. For the first time, we performed a comprehensive study of the characteristics of MPs in seawater and zooplankton in the Yellow Sea. For MPs in seawater, the average concentration is 0.13 +/- 0.20 pieces/m(3), dominated by fragments (42%). The average size is 3.72 +/- 4.70 mm, with the most frequent size appearing at 1200 mu m. The major polymer types are polypropylene and polyethylene, accounting for 88.13% in total. The distribution of MPs in seawater is patchy, with high MP concentrations close to the coastal cities. The average concentration of MPs in 11 total zooplankton groups is 12.24 +/- 25.70 pieces/m(3). The average size is 154.62 +/- 152.90 mu m, with 90% being <500 mu m. Fiber is the dominant shape of MPs found in zooplankton, accounting for 46%, but the composition of the polymer type is diverse. The retention of MPs in zooplankton depends on the taxa and their abundance in the Yellow Sea. Siphonophorea, Copepoda, Euphausiacea and Amphipoda are the main repositories compared to other groups, achieving 3.57, 2.44, 1.41 and 1.36 pieces/m(3), respectively. The high concentration area of MPs in zooplankton appeared near the adjacent waters of the Yangtze estuary. These results prove that zooplankton act as a repository for MPs in coastal waters. The retention of MPs in zooplankton is recommended as a key index for further ecological risk assessment of MPs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Current therapy involves oral administration of the nitroimidazole benznidazole (BNZ), which has serious side effects that often necessitate cessation of treatment. To both avoid off-target side effects and reduce the necessary dosage of BNZ, we packaged the drug within poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene sulfide) polymersomes (BNZ-PSs). We show that these vesicular nanocarriers enhanced intracellular delivery to phagocytic cells and tested this formulation in a mouse model of T. cruzi infection. BNZ-PS is not only nontoxic but also significantly more potent than free BNZ, effectively reducing parasitemia, intracellular infection, and tissue parasitosis at a 466-fold lower dose of BNZ. We conclude that BNZ-PS was superior to BNZ for treatment of T. cruzi infection in mice and that further modifications of this nanocarrier formulation could lead to a wide range of custom controlled delivery applications for improved treatment of Chagas disease in humans.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

While inorganic materials can be separated from MPs Wing density separation, the organic fraction impedes the ability to conduct reliable analyses. Hence, the purification of MPs from organic materials is crucial prior to conducting an identification via spectroscopic techniques. Strong, acidic or alkaline treatments bear the danger of degrading sensitive synthetic polymers. We suggest an alternative method, which uses a series of technical grade enzymes for purifying MPs in environmental samples. A basic enzymatic purification protocol (BEPP) proved to be efficient while reducing 98.3 +/- 0.1% of the sample matrix in surface water samples. After showing a high recovery rate (84.5 +/- 3.3%), the BEPP was successfully applied to environmental samples from the North Sea where numbers of MPs range from 0.05 to 4.42 items m(-3).

Elutriate solution, with or without sediment, was used to simulate interactions between estuarine water, plants and sediments. Metal contents on plants tissues and media were measured afterwards. Results showed that plants accumulated significant amounts (up to 70 times more than in non-exposed plants) of both metals in their belowground tissues (reaching ca. 1 mg/g of Cu and ca. 70 mu g/g of Cd in roots). Metal accumulation occurred either in absence or in presence of sediments, denoting plants capability to phytoremediate Cu and Cd. No significant metal translocation to the upper ground tissues was observed, metals levels being identical to those of non-exposed plants. The accumulation of both metals in plants belowground tissues was identical in the presence and absence of mPE, indicating that mPE did not interfered with plants capacity to phytoremediate Cu or Cd contaminated medium.

We investigated the near-field enhanced photoemission using time-of-flight momentum microscopy. The variation of the electron emission intensity as a function of kinetic energy, parallel momentum, power density, and polarization of the laser beam reveals two distinct emission mechanisms: a coherent multiphoton photoemission process from the optically heated electron gas and a field emission process resulting from the optical near-field enhancement at the nanoantenna tips. The analysis of the momentum-resolved kinetic energy spectra indicates a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of the electron gas temperature within the bow-tie resonators.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The presence of MPs was studied for the first time in the gut of benthic oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and in the water column in a eutrophic estuary under high anthropogenic pressure, in the southwestern Atlantic. Significant abundances of small plastic debris were found at all the sampling stations- mainly fibers, fragments, pellets, and beads. MPs were categorized and counted according to type, color, and size. Microfibers presented the highest percentage of abundance in the water column (98% with Van Dorn bottles and 72.73 % with a 60 mu m plankton net) as well as in oysters (91%). In water collected with Van Dorn bottles, the total MP concentrations ranged from 5900 to 782,000 particles/m(3) and from 42.6 to 113.6 particles/m(3) in samples collected with a 60 mu m plankton net. The widespread presence of fibers in all the assessed components could be related to the intense harbor activities in the area, such as the use of ropes for the mooring of boats and from fishing nets, as well as from domestic and industrial effluents. The presence of MPs in both the pelagic and benthic realms may imply risk for the animals that inhabit the estuary, and for human wellbeing, with respect to the potential transfer of MPs through the food web, affecting the provisioning of ecosystem services.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to quantify MP abundance in water and sediment of the German river Elbe using visual, spectroscopic (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) and thereto analytical (pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry) methods. Samples from eleven German sites along the German part of the Elbe were collected, both in the water and sediment phase, in order to better understand MP sinks and transport mechanisms. MP concentrations differed between the water and sediment phase. Sediment concentrations (mean: 3,350,000 particles m(-3), 125-5000 mu m MP) were in average 600,000-fold higher than water concentrations (mean: 5.57 particles m(-3), 150-5000 mu m MP). The abundance varied between the sampling sites: In sediments, the abundance decreased in the course of the river while in water samples no such clear trend was observed. This may be explained by a barrage retaining sediments and limiting tidal influence in the upstream parts of the river. Particle shape differed site-specifically with one site having exceptionally high quantities of spheres, most probably due to industrial emissions of PS-DVB resin beads. Suspended MP consisted predominantly of polyethylene and polypropylene whereas sediments contained a higher diversity of polymer types. Determined MP concentrations correspond well to previous results from other European rivers. In a global context, MI) levels in the Elbe relate to the lower (water) to middle section (sediment) of the global range of MP concentrations determined for rivers worldwide. This highlights that elevated MP levels are not only found in single countries or continents, but that MP pollution is an issue of global concern. (C) 2020 The Authors.

This work aimed at developing bioconjugates composed of EpCAM aptamer, polyethylene glycol, and dendrimers for specifically delivering celastrol into EpCAM-abundant tumors to improve the antitumor efficacy and mitigate the toxicity. The measurements of cancer cell targeting and apoptosis-inducing effects were conducted in SW620 colorectal cancer cells both in vitro and in nude mice, and the biosafety was evaluated in mice and zebrafish models. Our results showed that the bioconjugates (40 nm) possessed a spherical morphology with a negative surface charge, which maintained the great biostability in physiological environment. When exposed to bioconjugates, SW620 not AD293 cells underwent extensive apoptosis. The bioconjugates were superior to free celastrol in inducing apoptosis of SW620 cells in vitro and in nude mice. Moreover, they exhibited much reduced local and systemic toxicity both in xenograft mice and zebrafish models.

Plastic bags were the most common identifiable litter items, and we also found other consumer items (plastic bottles and cups). Styrofoam items suggest fishing or aquaculture activities as potential sea-based sources of FMD. These are the first data on FMD density in the Baltic Sea, and they are substantially lower than those reported for other coastal waters, which may be due to (i) lower human population densities, and (ii) higher environmental awareness in the Scandinavian countries.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

They are usually broken and show signs of having been repaired. Characteristics of floats and interviews with fishermen suggest two main causes of float loss. First, collisions between active gear, bottom trawl nets for shrimp, and passive gear, drift nets for fish, destroy nets and release fragments of them, including floats. Second, the difficulty with which floats are inserted on the float rope of the nets when they are used near the surface. Floats are inserted to replace damaged or lost floats, or they may be removed if it is desired that the nets be used in deeper waters. Floats may thus be poorly fixed to the cables and lost. Here a new float design that offers greater safety in use and for the replacement of floats is described and tested.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Firstly, entanglement and ingestion records for all marine birds, mammals, turtles, fish, and invertebrate species, are summarized from 747 studies. Marine debris affected 914 species through entanglement and/or ingestion. Ingestion was recorded for 701 species, entanglement was documented for 354 species. Secondly, the frequency of occurrence of ingestion per species (Sp%FO) was extracted for marine birds, mammals and turtles. Thirdly, for seabird species, average numbers of plastics ingested per individual were determined. Highest Sp-%FO and average number of plastics were found in tubenosed seabirds with 41% of all birds analysed having plastics, on average 9.9 particles per bird. The Sp-%FO and average number of ingested particles is lower for most other species. However, for certain species, ingestion rates of litter are reason for serious concern. Standardized methods are crucial for future studies, to generate datasets that allow higher level ecosystem analyses.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

With this in mind, this paper examines the public attitudes of the Irish and Norwegian general public to marine aquaculture. Both countries have long coastlines, a growing aquaculture industry and a strong emphasis on public participation in decision-making. The results indicate that both the Norwegian and Irish public recognise the potential of aquaculture to create opportunities for employment in coastal areas but opinion is much more divided on some of the more controversial impacts of aquaculture on the marine environment.

As mussel production represents more than 1/3 of EU aquaculture production, this decrease is an important contributor to the stagnation of EU aquaculture. Previous studies have suggested diseases, lack of mussel seed (spat), and low profitability as the main causes of the EU mussel production decrease. In this study, we investigate how economic and environmental factors have contributed. Moreover, we examine if the different mussel production techniques (raft, longline, on-bottom, and 'bouchot') have been differently affected, by analysing the economic performance and cost structure evolution for the period 2010-2016.

A pilot study conducted in Perth metropolitan waters aimed to explore the applicability of this approach, whilst quantifying levels of plastic pollution in an understudied part of the world. Pollution ranged from 950 to 60,000 pieces km(-2) and was dominated by fishing line. Offshore concentrations were highest with strongest Leeuwin Current flow, in the estuary immediately after rainfall, and increased in the nearshore after estuarine outfall. Results elucidated significant relationships between physical drivers and concentration changes and therefore their roles in increasing or decreasing local plastic pollution.

Discerning objects with a success rate of 90%, the proposed deep learning approach constitutes a leap towards the smart identification of plastics at the coastline and the sea. Training and testing loss and accuracy results for a range of epochs and batch sizes have lent credibility to the proposed method. Results originating from a resolution sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the prediction technique retains its ability to correctly identify plastics even when image resolution was downsized by 75%.

The shell matrix of nanofibers consisted of polyethylene oxide while the core matrix was made from a blend of silk and collagen. Several optimal mat architectures were engineered with distinct configurations, of which release profiles displayed an exponential trend, which indicates a first-order process following Fickian diffusion behavior. The flurbiprofen release lasted from 2 to 6 days, which was much faster compared to the one of vancomycin prolonged up to about 20 days. Mechanical data indicated tensile modulus, tensile strength, elongation before break of core/shell electrospun mats became enhanced or comparable to those for human skin after methanol vapor treatment. Desirable release kinetics and mechanical characteristics achieved by novel core/shell electrospun mats were attributable to induced enrichment of/3-sheet phase in silk via methanol vapor treatment as well as water annealing process with time and judicious selections for matrix materials and mat configurations.

We exposed 16 commonly ingested plastic items to fish and seabird laboratory gut mimic models using the digestive enzyme pepsin at pH 2 and shook them for 16 h at either 28 degrees C (in saltwater) for fish or 40 degrees C (in freshwater) for seabirds. Gut liquid was then evaluated for estrogen receptor activity using an in vitro cell line, and plastic-additive concentrations were quantified using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Both seabird (p < 0.0001) and fish gut conditions (p < 0.0001) significantly enhanced the biological estrogenicity of expanded polystyrene, polyethylene shopping bag, and polypropylene string relative to controls, resulting in up to a 10.6-fold increase in estrogenicity. Out of 12 plastic additives analyzed, bisphenol A (BPA) (204 +/- 129%) and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) (175 +/- 97%) concentrations were significantly increased in seabird gut conditions relative to control and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP) (132 +/- 68%) was significantly increased in fish gut conditions relative to control.

Among them, Di(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) is the most abundantly used plastic additive, and it has been reported to affect biochemical processes both in humans and wildlife; however, studies on its toxicological effects on marine organisms are still scarce. In this survey, we studied the cytotoxic, genotoxic, and mutagenic effects of DEHP in European sea bass embryonic cell line (DLEC) by applying specific in vitro tests. Results showed a significant decrease in cell viability starting at 0.01 mM of DEHP after 24 h together with a significant increase in apoptosis and necrosis, morphological changes and cell detachment. Consistently, we detected a moderate increase in DNA strand breaks from 0.02 mM, and a dose-dependent increase in of micronucleus frequency from 0.01 mM, accompanied by a significant inhibition of cell proliferation, which suggested a possible aneugenic effect of this phthalate.

Birds in particular mistake plastic for prey, and millions of wild birds carry small plastic loads in their stomach and are exposed to potential toxicological effects. It is currently unknown how severely the toxicological and endocrine disrupting chemicals in plastic affect avian development, reproduction and endocrine function. To address this question, we conducted multi-generational plastic feeding experiments to test the toxicological consequences of plastic ingestion at environmentally relevant loads in Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, investigating parental and two filial generations. Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence of lasting toxicological effects on mortality, adult body weight, organ histology, hormone levels, fertility, hatch rates and eggshell strength in birds experimentally fed plastic. However, we found plastic ingestion causes higher frequencies of male reproductive cysts and minor delays in chick growth and sexual maturity, though without affecting ultimate survival or reproductive output. We report that although plastic ingestion causes detectable endocrine effects in our model species, our lack of finding mortality, morbidity and adverse reproductive outcomes may challenge the common hypothesis of severe toxicological harm and population-level effects when environmentally relevant loads of plastic are ingested.

However, precorneal residence times and losses/drainage remain the foremost challenges associated with current ocular antifungal pharmacotherapy. In our previous investigations, NTM loaded polyethylene glycol nanolipid carriers (NTM-PNLCs) showed enhanced corneal permeation, both in vitro and in vivo. To further improve the corneal retention of NTM-PNLCs, this study aimed to develop a gelling system composed of carboxyvinyl polymer, guar gum, and boric acid in which the NTM-PNLCs were loaded.        Methods: A 2(3) factorial design was employed in formulating and optimizing the gelling system for NTM-PNLCs, where the independent factors were the gelling excipients (guar gum, boric acid, and Carbopol(R) 940) and dependent variables were gelling time, gel depot collapse time, rheology, firmness, and work of adhesion. Optimized gel was evaluated for transcorneal permeation using rabbit cornea, in vitro; and tear pharmacokinetics and ocular biodistribution in male New Zealand White rabbits, in vivo.        Results: Optimized NTM-PNLC-GEL was found to exhibit shear thinning rheology, adequate firmness, and spreadability, and formed a depot that did not collapse immediately. In addition, the in vitro transcorneal evaluation studies indicated that the NTM-PNLC-GEL exhibited a lower/slower flux and rate in comparison to Natacyn(R) suspension. NTM-PNLC-GEL (0.3%), at a 16-fold lower dose, exhibited mean residence time and elimination half-life comparable to Natacyn (5%), and provided similar in vivo concentrations in the innermost tissues of the eye.

The combined dataset of 4389 individuals from 15 species allows the analysis of spatial distribution and temporal variability of plastic uptake in fish. Airborne fibre contamination was observed to be the main contributor to fibres encountered in the samples. The number of fibres in samples was strongly related to the time needed to process a sample, not to the number of individual fishes in the sample. Accurate correction for secondary fibre contamination was not possible, but corrections required would be similar to fibre numbers observed in the samples. Consequently, all fibres were omitted from further analysis. The frequency of occurrence and the average number of plastics in fish is generally low (1.8% and 0.022 pieces per organism respectively), with only cod having a higher prevalence (12.3%). While latitude of catch locations influences plastic uptake in fish, no correlation with the distance to the coast was found. Slightly less plastics were ingested in winter, and a decrease in plastics ingested was observed between 2009 and 2018. These factors should be considered when fish species, catch location and time are discussed as indicators for plastic pollution in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive. We recommend considering demersal cod and pelagic sprat as two species suitable for monitoring plastic ingestion in biota, both on the seafloor and in the water column. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The human impact on the environment was evident in the studied species, reflecting the high contamination of the diet of these fish with plastic debris. Plastic debris is frequently ingested by C. acoupa, regardless of season, area or ontogenetic phase. However, a higher frequency and amount of ingestion suggests that this contaminant might also be acquired through direct consumption and biotransference (from contaminated prey). The ontogenetic phases of C. acoupa utilized different estuarine reaches during seasonal fluctuations. This behaviour was strongly influenced by environmental variables, particularly salinity. During all seasons, juveniles used the upper estuary as shelter to avoid marine predators. However, in the early rainy season, the upper estuary was significantly important as a nursery for this species. The sub-adults used the upper estuary as a feeding ground during the year and migrated to the middle estuary during the late rainy season to avoid osmoregulatory stress. Adults were observed only in the coastal waters of the lower estuary. The trophic guild changed during the ontogeny of C. acoupa, and juveniles primarily fed on plastic debris (FO = 64%), amphipoda (FO = 34%), mysidacea (FO = 17%) and Cathorops spixii (FO = 15%). Sub-adults preferred plastic debris (FO = 50%) and C. spixii (FO = 30%). Both juveniles and sub-adults were classified as opportunistic.

While it is useful to recycle used plastic materials, contaminated plastics require a series of pretreatments prior to the process. Here, we offer a viable thermochemical conversion (pyrolysis) platform to directly valorize fishing net waste (FNW). Prior to the pyrolysis of FNW that was collected at a Korean seaport, its chemical composition (polyethylene) was examined using thermogravimetric analysis, ultimate analysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy measurements. Pyrolysis of FNW was conducted to produce value-added syngas and C1-2 hydrocarbons (HCs) in both CO2 and N-2 environments with a variety of pyrolysis setups. The pyrolysis temperature significantly contributed to the thermal cracking of long-chain liquid HCs into H-2 and C1-2 HCs under the N-2 and CO2 conditions. In the presence of cobalt-based catalysts, an additional improvement of the reaction kinetics for producing H-2 and C1-2 HCs was shown in the N-2 environment. However, the synergistic effectiveness of Co-based catalysts and CO2 resulted in CO formation, because CO2 provided additional C and O sources over the Co-based catalysts. Thus, it allowed control of the H-2/CO ratio in the CO2 and N-2 atmospheres. The compositional matrix of the liquid HCs after pyrolysis also confirmed that CO2 controlled their aromaticity. Thus, the CO2-cofeeding pyrolysis of FNW can be considered a viable platform for the direct treatment of plastic wastes by harvesting energy as a form of syngas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

It impacts negatively marine environment, organisms, human health and coastal communities. In this research, abundance, composition and sources of marine litter (macro-debris > 2.5 cm) and beach cleanliness were assessed for three beaches in the central Croatian Adriatic Sea. Mean abundance for the studied region was 3.35 items/m(2) and the highest recorded CCI value was 150. Most of the collected litter was made of artificial polymer material (93.86%), and main sources of litter were shoreline activities representing (31.68% of the total sample) and fishing and aquaculture representing (12.66% of the total sample). Land-based and sea-based sources accounted for 32.76% and 15.16%, respectively. Results from the present study provide another evidence of marine litter problem and high presence of plastic items in the marine environment of the Adriatic Sea. Presence of litter from different countries shows the internationality of marine litter problem which can only be solved by international collaborations and partnerships as well as by taking individual responsibility of all. Presence of the short-life single-use plastic items and the problems associated with them have been recognized in this study as most of the items collected were single-use items. High abundance of these items indicates not only their large use in everyday life, but also the lack of awareness of the general public about the environmental problem they cause.

Bravo and Ask, Amalie, V and van Franeker, Jan Andries",,,,,"Although ingestion of plastic by tubenosed seabirds has been documented regularly, identification of the polymer composition of these plastics has rarely been described. Polymer assessment may assist in identifying sources and may indicate risks from additives occurring in specific types of polymers. Using known test materials, two identification methods Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and near infrared spectroscopy (FTIR and NIR) were compared. Although both methods were found to be similarly suitable for identification of plastic polymers, a significant difference was observed in identification of natural materials. FTIR frequently misclassified natural materials as being a synthetic polymer. Within our results, an 80% match score threshold functioned best to distinguish between natural items and synthetics. Using NIR, the historical variability of plastics ingested by northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) from the Dutch sector of the North Sea was analysed for three time periods since the 1980s. For the more recent decade, variability between fulmars from different regions in the northeast Atlantic was investigated. Regional variation was further explored by analysing plastics obtained from the stomachs of southern hemisphere relatives of the fulmar (southern fulmar, cape petrel, snow petrel) and Wilson's storm petrel. Results show that proportional abundance of polymer types in these seabirds is closely related to the plastic categories that they ingest (e.g. pellets, foam, fragments). The uptake of different plastic categories and related polymer types most likely reflects spatial and temporal variations in availability rather than ingestion preferences of the birds.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Numerous marine species are affected by plastic debris through entanglement, nest incorporation, and ingestion, which can lead to lethal and sub-lethal impacts. However, in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, an area of international importance for seabirds, there has been little effort to date to assess information from studies of wildlife and plastic to better understand the spatiotemporal variation of how marine plastic affects different seabird species. To improve our understanding of seabirds and marine plastic in this region, we completed a synthesis of the published and grey literature to obtain information on all known documented cases of plastic ingestion and nest incorporation by this group. We found that of 69 seabird species that commonly occur in the northeastern Atlantic, 25 had evidence of ingesting plastic. However, data on plastic ingestion was available for only 49% of all species, with 74% of investigated species recorded ingesting plastic. We found only three published studies on nest incorporation, for the Northern Gannet (Morus bassanus) and Black-legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla). For many species, sample sizes were small or not reported, and only 39% of studies were from the 21st century, whilst information from multiple countries and years was only available for 11 species. This indicates that we actually know very little about the current prevalence of plastic ingestion and nest incorporation for many species, several of them globally threatened. Furthermore, in the majority of studies, the metrics reported were inadequate to carry out robust comparisons among locations and species or perform meta-analyses. We recommend multi-jurisdictional collaboration to obtain a more comprehensive and current understanding of how marine plastic is affecting seabirds in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean.

Humans have been part of this picture for much of their existence. But the industrial revolution started in the XIX century and the subsequent advances in medicine, chemistry, agriculture and communications have impacted such balances to an unprecedented degree - and the problem has nothing but exacerbated in the last 20 years. Human overpopulation, industrial growth along with unsustainable use of natural resources have driven many sites and perhaps the planetary ecosystem as a whole, beyond recovery by spontaneous natural means, even if the immediate causes could be stopped. The most conspicuous indications of such a state of affairs include the massive change in land use, the accelerated increase in the levels of greenhouse gases, the frequent natural disasters associated to climate change and the growing nonrecyclable waste (e.g. plastics and recalcitrant chemicals) that we release to the Environment. While the whole planet is afflicted at a global scale by chemical pollution and anthropogenic emissions, the ongoing development of systems and synthetic biology, meta-genomics, modern chemistry and some key concepts from ecological theory allow us to tackle this phenomenal challenge and propose large-scale interventions aimed at reversing and even improving the situation. This involves (i) identification of key reactions or processes that need to be re-established (or altogether created) for ecosystem reinstallation, (ii) implementation of such reactions in natural or designer hosts able to self-replicate and deliver the corresponding activities when/where needed in a fashion guided by sound ecological modelling, (iii) dispersal of niche-creating agents at a global scale and (iv) containment, monitoring and risk assessment of the whole process.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Some of these materials beach while others accumulate in convergent zones in coastal seas and the open ocean. Although accumulations associated with subtropical gyres, for example, the ?Great Pacific Garbage Patch? (GPGP) are well-known, coastal accumulation zones have received less attention. Here we report quantities and characteristics of plastics accumulated in fronts encountered within the Ashmore Reef marine park (Pulau Pasir), northern Australia. These areas, as well as surrounding waters, were sampled using Manta trawls, drone, and snorkel surveys conducted in October 2018. With mean plastic concentrations of 523,146 pieces km(-2) for plastics > 500 micron these hotpots contained plastic concentrations an order of magnitude higher than surrounding waters (16,561 pieces km(-2)) and comparable to the largest known accumulation zone: the GPGP. Furthermore, the mean mass within hotspots was 5,161 g km(-2) vs. 9 g km(-2) in surrounding waters. Therefore, we classify the features described in this study as types of 'Coastal Garbage Patches' (CGPs). Importantly, the coastal fronts accumulating plastics in CGPs are key habitats for many marine species. Biomass outnumbered plastics by weight, with a ratio of 0.521 in CGPs and 0.016 in surrounding waters vs. 287.7 recorded in the GPGP. Polymer types found between the CGPs and GPGP were similar, but plastic films vastly dominated in the CGPs, whilst they were amongst the rarest types found in the GPGP. This study demonstrates the existence of CGPs coinciding with high priority conservation zones in coastal waters and highlights a need for further research into these environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Solving the plastic pollution problem is not easy, as it requires the action and commitment of all sectors of our society. With a coastline extending over 4,000 km (from 18 degrees S to 56 degrees S), Chile is a maritime country, and since plastics are potentially harmful for marine and coastal ecosystems, food security, and public health, plastic pollution is a real threat. Chile is the sixth-largest exporter of seafood (fish, invertebrates, and algae) in the world, but the extent of plastic contamination of marine organisms, its potential effects on commercial species and aquaculture, and its subsequent effects on human health are mostly unknown. Chile has recently introduced some legislation to prevent plastics from reaching the environment and the coastal ocean. Governmental and non-governmental organizations have joined an informal alliance to take action against plastic pollution, both at a national and regional level, but stronger involvement of producers and commerce is required for effective measures. Chilean scientists working on plastic pollution have created the Scientific Plastic Pollution Alliance of Chile network, aiming to promote collaborative and coordinated research focused on this pollutant. The wide geographical extent of Chile, with researchers working in diverse ecosystems, provides a unique opportunity to better understand the consequences of one of the most recent and severe threats to biodiversity. Rather than solely presenting the plastic pollution problem from the scientific perspective, this paper includes views from different sectors of society. Mitigating plastic pollution is exceptionally complex, with this study highlighting the importance of local engagement, media, solving social inequities, new legislation, and law enforcement in order to advance on decreasing plastic pollution from a country-wide perspective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,
rayyan-185169421,Modeling the Exposure of the Macaronesia Islands (NE Atlantic) to Marine        Plastic Pollution,2021,4,30,FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE,,8,,,"Cardoso, C and Caldeira, RMA and Cardoso, Claudio and Caldeira, Rui M. A.",,,,,"The constant increase of marine plastic pollution poses an unprecedented risk to oceanic islands, which become increasingly exposed to a hazard of which they have very little control. Located in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, the Macaronesia is comprised by the Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands, and Cabo Verde. Although past studies suggest that most plastic items collected on these islands are from offshore regions, their actual sources remain unclear to present date. As such, we focus on the characterization of the potential sources and pathways of plastic particles reaching the Macaronesia archipelagos. This is achieved by combining modeled datasets for ocean currents, winds and waves with a Lagrangian tool used to track virtual particles released around the archipelagos for a 10-year period, making a distinction between surface and submerged particles. Global drifter trajectories are also assessed, selecting those that intercept the archipelagos. Our results demonstrate that the North Atlantic subtropical gyre is the most conspicuous feature in particles and drifter trajectories. The Gulf Stream acts as the main pathway for all archipelagos at a regional scale, though with less significance to Cabo Verde. Surface particles are connected to regional sources in a shorter timescale than mixed particles, mainly because of the wind. Intercepting high-windage particle trajectories are dominant at the center of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, demonstrating that particles originating from the North Atlantic ""garbage patch"" are most likely to intercept the archipelagos if considerably exposed to the wind. Regarding the connectivity to sources, all archipelagos are significantly exposed to areas of intensive fishing activity, mainly those located in the Gulf Stream (Azores), in international waters off the Portuguese coast (Madeira and Canary Islands) and along the Northwestern African coast (Cabo Verde). The east coasts of Central and North America are the main sources of land-based particles reaching the Azores, Madeira, and Canary Islands, whereas the Northwestern African coast is the main source for land-based particles reaching Cabo Verde. Our results demonstrate how vulnerable the Macaronesian archipelagos are to marine plastic pollution, highlighting the urgency for international cooperation to mitigate the exposure of oceanic islands to marine plastic pollution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

C. and Sumaila, Rashid U. and Woodall, Lucy C.",,,,,"The ocean crisis is urgent and central to human wellbeing and life on Earth; past and current activities are damaging the planet's main life support system for future generations. We are witnessing an increase in ocean heat, disturbance, acidification, bio-invasions and nutrients, and reducing oxygen levels. Several of these act like ratchets: once detrimental or negative changes have occurred, they may lock in place and may not be reversible, especially at gross ecological and ocean process scales. Each change may represent a loss to humanity of resources, ecosystem function, oxygen production and species. The longer we pursue unsuitable actions, the more we close the path to recovery and better ocean health and greater benefits for humanity in the future. We stand at a critical juncture and have identified eight priority issues that need to be addressed in unison to help avert a potential ecological disaster in the global ocean. They form a purposely ambitious agenda for global governance and are aimed at informing decision-makers at a high level. They should also be of interest to the general public. Of all the themes, the highest priority is to rigorously address global warming and limit surface temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C by 2100, as warming is the pre-eminent factor driving change in the ocean. The other themes are establishing a robust and comprehensive High Seas Treaty, enforcing existing standards for Marine Protected Areas and expanding their coverage, especially in terms of high levels of protection, adopting a precautionary pause on deep-sea mining, ending overfishing and destructive fishing practices, radically reducing marine pollution, putting in place a financing mechanism for ocean management and protection, and lastly, scaling up science/data gathering and facilitating data sharing. By implementing all eight measures in unison, as a coordinated strategy, we can build resilience to climate change, help sustain fisheries productivity, particularly for low-income countries dependent on fisheries, protect coasts (e.g. via soft-engineering/habitat-based approaches), promote mitigation (e.g. carbon storage) and enable improved adaptation to rapid global change.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANA: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,
