rayyan-684570793,Fate of recycled tyre granulate used on artificial turf,2021,1,1,Environmental Sciences Europe,,33,1,,"Verschoor, A.J. and van Gelderen, A. and Hofstra, U.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102055314&doi=10.1186%2fs12302-021-00459-1&partnerID=40&md5=2778ff228d9a68b6cb660236969dcac8,,,,"The production of granulates as infill for artificial turf is able to process 21% of the end-of-life tyres in Europe, approximately 600 million kg per year. In doing so it avoids an annual CO2 emission comparable with the amount that could be absorbed byÂ around 30 km2 of forest. However, dispersal of rubber infill to the environment is perceived as a problem. An amount of 3000â€“5000Â kg granulate per field per year is currently used as underpinning for a European proposal to ban rubber infill as part of the intended restriction on intentionally added microplastics in 2021. By reviewing grey research reports, we found out that the dispersal rates are based on the false assumption that the annual granulate demand for refilling is necessary because of granulate losses to the environment. However, it has been ignored that part of the refill is needed because the infill layer settles and becomes more dense (compaction) and that part of the lost infill is collected and reused on the fields. In combination with unawareness and improper piling of snow in the past, these are the causes of the high estimates of infill dispersal per year. This paper shows the current state-of-knowledge about ELT granulate dispersal and shows that approximately 600â€“1200Â kg refill is required annually to compensate for compaction and for some infill waste on pavements and in drainage sinks. Recommended mitigation measures are containment through optimized field and drainage construction, suitable maintenance equipment and practices and good-housekeeping rules for players and groundkeepers and handling end-of-life pitches. If these recommendations are implemented, the emission of ELT granulates to the environment can be reduced to virtually zero.

Given that the Arctic is not a highly populated area, very low levels of plastics are expected. However, the Arctic is not significantly less polluted than populated areas further south. Plastic has already been found in most compartments of the Arctic Ocean and climate change will likely exacerbate that issue due to sea ice melting and increasing maritime activities. The Arctic fauna is, and will be, increasingly exposed to the plastic pollution threat in the coming years and decades. The objective of this review is providing a summary of existing data, as well as perspectives and important knowledge gaps regarding plastic ingestion by Arctic fauna. Among other knowledge gaps, we highlighted the need for a species for biomonitoring of plastic pollution in the Arctic, i.e. the northern fulmar and/or the polar cod, for more data in fauna from the Russian and European Arctic and for experimental studies on impacts of plastic ingestion on Arctic species.

There is little information on the impact of sludge processes on the number of microplastics in sludge. In this study, the presence of microplastics in sludge produced by the Sari WWTP in northern Iran was investigated. Samples were taken in 3 replications and microplastics larger than 37 Î¼m were extracted. The sludge from primary settling tank, clarifier, after sludge thickener and after aerobic digester, and after dewatering contained 214, 206, 200, 238, and 129 microplastics/g dry weight, respectively. According to the amount of sludge produced for each unit, this equals 280, 362, 599, 601, and 276 million microplastics/day, respectively, of which more than 85% were fibers. The numbers of microplastics in the sludge from the output of the sludge thickener and the aerobic digester did not significantly differ. However, their numbers decreased by more than 50% after dewatering, probably due to the destruction of flocs in the digestive process and the release of attached microplastics, which are returned into the wastewater treatment process with the rejected water. Polyester and polyethylene were the predominant types of fibers and particles, respectively. Given the annual amount of sludge produced, more than 100 billion microplastics enter the environment per year. Wastewater sludge, therefore, is an important source for the emission of microplastics, especially fibers, to the environment, warranting further evaluation of the associated environmental hazards.

The accumulation of microplastics in freshwater and marine environments has strong ecological implications due to their long persistence, potential toxicity, and ability to adsorb other pollutants, acting as vectors of pathogens. Nevertheless, while the number of studies on the presence of microplastics in the wild fish increased, less attention has been paid to the farmed fish species. Here, we investigated the occurrence of microparticles in the digestive tracts of Sparus aurata and Cyprinus carpio at different life stages and reared by an intensive and semi-intensive production system, respectively. Our results showed the presence of natural microfibers and microplastics, with microfibers (~ 90%) being the dominant type. In both fish species, the presence of microparticles was not revealed at larval stage. Fry and adult S. aurata specimens showed microfiber abundances of 0.21 and 1.3 items/individual, respectively. A lower load of microparticles (p < 0.05) occurred in fry (0.06 items/individual) and adult C. carpio specimens (0.25 items/individual). As to the chemical composition of the micro-items, natural (20%), semi-synthetic (28%), and single or blended synthetic fibers (52%) were identified in S. aurata. Linen, rayon, lyocell, cotton: polyester and polyester (12.5% concentration for each polymer) fibers were identified in C. carpio, while PTFE (37.5%) was present as fragments. Rayon was the most frequent chemical type (21.2%). The polymer composition of the extracted microparticles showed significant differences between the fish species analysed (p < 0.05). Notably, a considerably lower contamination level of synthetic polymers (average 0.11 items/individual) was detected in the farmed fishes compared with the data obtained in other studies on feral ones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the plastic and the non-plastic microfiber contamination in the farmed S. aurata and C. carpio at different life stages.

In particular, exposure to PS-MPs caused significant decrease in heart function and swimming competence, while enhanced levels of oxidative stress indices and metabolic adjustments were observed in the heart of challenged species.

Plastic debris in aquatic environment can degrade into micro/nanoplastics, leading to biopersistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. Here, we determined the potential hepatotoxicity of polystyrene (PS) microplastics at an environmental relevant level. The results reveal that oral administration of PS (diameter 5 Î¼m, exposure doses of 0.1 mg/day) notably triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the liver as evidence by activation of the eIF2Î±-ATF4-C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) axis. Moreover, relief of ER stress by 4-phenylbutyric acid (4pba) effectively inhibited PS (0.5 mg/mL)-induced apoptosis in L02 hepatocytes, and similar results were in cells with protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) gene silencing. After PS treatment, PERK knockdown positively regulated Bcl2 expression, accompanied with decreased expression of Bax and Cytochrome C (Cyt C). Furthermore, we also found that PS significantly induced excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and these effects were significantly suppressed by PERK gene silencing. Meanwhile, the results showed that suppression of PERK hyperactivation could improve cell survival, accompanied by inhibition of parkin-mediated mitophagy induced by PS in vitro. Overall, these data demonstrated that ER stress induced by PS is the cause of hepatocyte mitophagy and oxidative stress. Additionally, the regulation of PERK signaling may be crucial in PS exposure-induced hepatotoxicity. This investigation provided basic toxicological data toward elucidating the impacts of microplastics on mammals.

In this study, the presence of microplastics was investigated in three mussel species sourced from various retailers in Italy, supplied as a fresh or processed product. The exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was empirically assessed relating to the potential weight of plastic ingested with a mussel portion. The mussel samples were digested using a solution of hydrogen peroxide 30% Vol. and a density separation was performed adding a concentrated saline solution. The filtered samples were analysed under a stereomicroscope and the chemical composition of the visually sorted items was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy. A significantly higher number of items was found in fresh mussels (0.20 Â± 0.24 items/g w.w.; 0.40 Â± 0.47 items/individual) than in processed ones (0.9 Â± 0.10 items/g w.w.; 0.17 Â± 0.19 items/individual). Several plastic polymers were identified by FT-IR and polyethylene was the dominant type. European shellfish consumers could be exposed up to ~585 MP/year and ~253 MP/year by the consumption of fresh and processed mussels, respectively. A portion of fresh and processed mussels contaminated with MPs would contribute only minimally to daily human exposure to PCBs and PAHs. The sources of microplastics in store-bought mussels may be several and related to the contamination along the food production chain. In this regard, further studies are needed to properly assess and manage the risk of microplastics in food.

These small particles (<5 mm) might come from the fragmentation or direct emission of artificial and synthetic polymers. Among them, the microfibers (MF) are one of the most common types of microplastics identified in the environment. On the other hand, the most encountered type of garbage found in clean-up campaigns is the cigarette butts, which contains the smoked filters (SF) and unsmoked rests of tobacco. SFs are hazardous debris but are usually not properly disposed as such, and are composed of >15,000 strands that can be detached as MFs. This study aims to evaluate the detachment rate, the acute aquatic toxicity, and the aquatic-, thermooxidative-, and photo-degradability of the MFs generated from SFs. In this way, it was found that SFs detach approximately 100 small MFs (<0.2 mm) per day. In a rough estimation, about 0.3 million tons of potential MFs might be annually reaching aquatic environments from this source. Concerning the eco-toxicity, a statistically significant difference was found when MFs are present in the leachate generated by the SFs, where the Daphnia magna EC100 and EC50 were of 0.620 SF/L and 0.017 SF/L, respectively. Finally, the degradability of the SFs was evaluated by applying two methods (ATR-FTIR analysis and gravimetry). In both of them, a low degradability rate was observed. Thus, it may be concluded that MFs from SFs constitute an important source of microplastics, which might partially explain the high concentration of artificial polymers that have been found in the deep-sea sediments. Yet, the correct management of the SFs is an unsolved issue that should receive urgent attention.

However, there is little information available on the accumulation of microplastics in soils fertilized over the long term. Here, we investigate the characteristics of microplastics in both pig manure and soil following long-term manure application in an attempt to assess their accumulation and the potential risk to agricultural soils of repeated application of pig manure. Microplastics were separated from soil and pig manure samples using a sequential flow separation and flotation method. The abundances of microplastics were 16.4 Â± 2.7 and 43.8 Â± 16.2 particles kgâˆ’1 in control plots (CK, no manure applied) and plots amended annually with pig manure for 22 years (PM), respectively. The microplastics (especially fragments) were significantly enriched in PM-amended soil compared with the control plots. The average annual abundance of microplastics was 1250 Â± 640 particles kgâˆ’1 in manure. Interestingly, the type and polymer composition of microplastics were very similar in the soil and manure. Differences in color and particle size indicate that microplastics sourced from pig manure may be gradually weathered and degraded after incorporation into the soil. The average accumulation rate of microplastics in the agricultural soil with long-term application of pig manure was estimated to be 3.50 Â± 1.71 million particles haâˆ’1 aâˆ’1. The microplastics in the manured soil displayed complicated weathered surfaces. The presence of carbonyl groups suggests that the weathered microplastics in soil may have the potential to adsorb contaminants.

TA reveals that hollow gold nanospheres (HGNs) exhibit faster excited state relaxation and larger amplitude acoustic phonon modes than solid gold nanoparticles of the same outer diameter. MD simulation carried out on full scale nanoparticle-water models (over 10 million atoms) to simulate the temporal evolution (0-100 ps) of the thermally excited particles (1000 or 1250 K) provides atomic-scale resolution of the spatiotemporal temperature and pressure maps, as well as visualization of the lattice vibrational modes. For the 1000 K HGN, temperatures upward of 500 K in the vicinity of the shell surface were observed, along with pressures up to several hundred MPa in the inner cavity, revealing potential use as a photoinduced nanoreactor. Our approach of combining TA and MD provides a path to better understanding how thermal-structural properties (such as expansion and contraction) and thermal-optical properties (such as modulated dielectrics) manifest themselves as TA signatures.

A mathematical model expressing microplastic concentration in soil and water as a linear function of the measured S11 resonance frequency shift and relative permittivity contrast is developed and is found to be in an excellent agreement with the experimental data based on synthetic contaminated material samples. Next, this model is applied to find the best achievable theoretical resolution of microplastic concentration in the natural environment using microwave sensing technology, which is shown to be at around 100ppm (parts-per-million) level in the linear signal detection regime. It is demonstrated that the best achievable level of microplastic contaminant resolution depends on the sensor probe Q-factor and sensitivity of the microwave receiver. The bound for the achievable contaminant concentration resolution is found in the analytical form for high-Q resonance microwave sensors of arbitrary geometry. Even though several well-established protocols based on optical, infrared, and X-ray spectroscopy are currently being used for microplastic detection in the natural environment, microwave spectroscopy could offer additional benefits, especially for low-cost, real-time in-situ microplastic detection in diverse environmental conditions outside of the laboratory space.

This fish feeds mainly on invertebrates, but they are also susceptible to ingesting and accumulating microplastic residues similar in size to some of their usual prey. In this study, we analyzed the contents of the gastrointestinal tract of adult individuals of this species from two restored coastal lagoons, to characterize the ingestion of microplastics. 156 specimens of Gambusia holbrooki were analyzed: 92 females and 64 males. Females had a greater weight and length than males. 44% of the fish presented some microplastic residue (fibers or fragments) in their gastrointestinal contents. Most of the microplastics (48%) ranged between 100 and 400 Âµm. Blue fibers and brown fragments were the most common. The average number of microplastics per individual was slightly higher in males than in females, in spring samples than in summer ones, and in lagoon G02 compared to L04, although only significant differences were found between the lagoons. In addition, individuals with lower weight presented a greater amount of microplastics. In this sense, the presence of microplastics in the gastrointestinal contents of fish can be an indicator of the increase in plastic residues in Mediterranean coastal ecosystems, with the potential to alter the trophic dynamics of aquatic organisms.

Up to now, however, scientific knowledge in this context has been scarce and insufficient for a reliable risk assessment. To remedy this scarcity of data, we investigated possible adverse effects of polystyrene particles (104 particles/L) and the pesticide methiocarb (1Â mg/L) in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) both by themselves as well as in combination after a 96Â h laboratory exposure. PS beads (density 1.05Â g/mL) were cryogenically milled and fractionated resulting in irregular-shaped particles (&lt; 50Â Âµm). Besides body weight of the animals, biomarkers for proteotoxicity (stress protein family Hsp70), oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase, lipid peroxidation), and neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase, carboxylesterases) were analyzed. As an indicator of overall health, histopathological effects were studied in liver and gills of exposed fish. Results: Polystyrene particles by themselves did not influence any of the investigated biomarkers. In contrast, the exposure to methiocarb led to a significant reduction of the activity of acetylcholinesterase and the two carboxylesterases. Moreover, the tissue integrity of liver and gills was impaired by the pesticide. Body weight, the oxidative stress and the stress protein levels were not influenced by methiocarb. Effects caused by co-exposure of polystyrene microplastics and methiocarb were the same as those caused by methiocarb alone. Conclusions: Overall, methiocarb led to negative effects in juvenile brown trout. In contrast, polystyrene microplastics in the tested concentration did not affect the health of juvenile brown trout and did not modulate the toxicity of methiocarb in this fish species.

Hundreds of millions of euros/dollars have been invested into safety issues of ENMs, and much progress has been made in the understanding of their fate and effects in the environment. After an initial phase of â€œobserving the effects,â€ research has shifted toward elucidating the mechanisms of fate and ecotoxicological effects. This also included a stronger focus on exposure issues and the development of analytical methods and computational models to predict exposure. First environmental risk assessments for ENM were performed, and much progress has been achieved on the way to nanospecific and material-specific assessments. The release of ENM from products and their transformation in technical and natural compartments profoundly affect the form in which the ENMs are present in the environment. A crucial aspect in all areas is if there are truly nanospecific issues of the novel-added functionalities of ENM that are different from dissolved metals, larger particles, or natural particles. This review outlines progress in understanding the environmental dimensions of ENMs and areas that merit further investigation: To what extent are ENMs different from their natural counterparts and how â€œlongâ€ do we need to track them in natural and technical systems? A major challenge will be in developing methods for studying particle-mediated processes and their effects on ecosystems and organisms in a more general sense, going beyond just ENM, for example, to natural nanoparticles, microplastics, and extracellular vesicles.

The results showed that 30â€“40% of the anchovies had ingested anthropogenic microparticles (on average, 0.34 Â± 0.29 fibres indâˆ’1 and 0.12 Â± 0.12 fragments indâˆ’1). The fibres were probably ingested via filtration, and were significantly correlated with the gut fullness. Fibres were mostly dark, but the presence of other colours was frequent, indicating a general lack of selectivity. Plastic fragments composed of polyethylene and polypropylene were prevalently transparent, suggesting active predation, especially for larger fragments resembling zooplankton. No significant differences were recorded for the frequency of fish containing particles among females, males, and undetermined individuals. The presence of, generally, only one anthropogenic item per fish, as observed for 95.8% of fish containing microparticles, indicated that the permanence of these particles in the stomachs was short, likely no more than 1 day, although it could also depend on low environmental concentrations. The evaluation of the intestinal lumen indicated that a portion of the plastic fragments found in the stomach could not be ejected. Hard fragments that were larger than the intestinal lumen could be held for longer times, but probably regurgitation, fragmentation, and embedding in a biological matrix may facilitate their quick elimination. It is pivotal to understand the processes that regulate the abundance and the residential time of anthropogenic particles in commercial organisms captured for human nutrition, given the potential biomagnification of toxic substances carried by ingested particles.

The review tries to understand the impact of macro and micro litters, microplastic, metals like mercury and nanoparticles. Finally, we conclude with the ways to regulate the presence and distribution of these xenobiotics in marine environment. Â© 2020 Phcogj.Com.

However, we still know relatively little about how much plastic pollution has found its way into the deeper areas of the worldâ€™s oceans. The extent of microplastic pollution in deep-sea sediments remains poorly quantified, but this knowledge is imperative for predicting the distribution and potential impacts of global plastic pollution. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified microplastics in deep-sea sediments from the Great Australian Bight using an adapted density separation and dye fluorescence technique. We analyzed sediment cores from six locations (1â€“6 cores each, n = 16 total samples) ranging in depth from 1,655 to 3,062 m and offshore distances ranging from 288 to 356 km from the Australian coastline. Microplastic counts ranged from 0 to 13.6 fragments per g dry sediment (mean 1.26 Â± 0.68; n = 51). We found substantially higher microplastic counts than recorded in other analyses of deep-sea sediments. Overall, the number of microplastic fragments in the sediment increased as surface plastic counts increased, and as the seafloor slope angle increased. However, microplastic counts were highly variable, with heterogeneity between sediment cores from the same location greater than the variation across sampling sites. Based on our empirical data, we conservatively estimate 14 million tonnes of microplastic reside on the ocean floor.

Direct ingestion and trophic transfer are likely to be the main pathway for microplastics to bioaccumulate in upper trophic level organisms. Bioaccumulation potential of MPs in marine mammalian foodwebs is scarcely known. To understand whether microplastics bioaccumulate in marine mammals, a bioaccumulation model for MPs was developed for the filter-feeding humpback whale and fish-eating resident killer whale foodwebs of the Northeastern Pacific. Applying three concentration scenarios for MPs by entering observed water and sediment concentrations as input data (low, high, and moderate scenarios), and tested under two different elimination rates (kE) for zooplankton, the model predicted species-specific and foodweb-specific bioaccumulation potential. The predator-prey biomagnification factor (BMFTL, used to assess the ratio of the MP concentration in predator to that in prey adjusted to the difference of trophic levels), involving cetaceans, appeared to be not only lower than one or equal to one (BMFTL â‰¤ 1 as in resident killer whale/Chinook salmon), but also BMFTL &gt; 1 in some predator-prey relationships (humpback whale/zooplankton). Depending on the magnitude of abiotic concentrations used in the modeling, the trophic magnification factor (TMF) regression analyses over time showed lack of evidence for trophic magnification as the magnification was independent of the trophic level, indicating no changes (TMF = 1; p &gt; 0.05), and trophic dilution (TMF &lt; 1; p &lt; 0.05) due to the decrease in MP concentrations as the trophic level increased. Projected biomagnification in simplified foodwebs revealed no significant increase in concentrations as the trophic level increased (TMF = 1; p &gt; 0.05), following 100â€“365 days. Compared to the high biomagnification behavior of persistent organic pollutants in marine foodwebs, scarce biomagnification capacity of microplastic was predicted in the cetacean foodwebs. Notwithstanding, the moderate to high microplastic bioaccumulation predicted in some lower trophic level marine organisms highlights the health risks of toxic exposure to marine fauna strongly relying on fish and coastal communities highly dependent on seafood. This modeling work provides a tool to assess the bioaccumulation potential and impact of microplastics in the marine environment to support risk assessment and inform plastic waste management.

In fact, most of the 300 million tons of plastics produced each year ends up in the environment and the soil acts as a log-term sink for these plastic debris. Therefore, the aim of this review is to discuss MP and NP pollution in soil as well as highlighting the knowledge gaps that are mainly related to the complexity of the soil ecosystem. The fate of MPs and NPs in soil is strongly determined by physical properties of plastics, whereas negligible effect is exerted by their chemical structures. The degradative processes of plastic, termed ageing, besides generating micro-and nano-size debris, can induce marked changes in their chemical and physical properties with relevant effects on their reactivity. Further, these processes could cause the release of toxic oligomeric and monomeric constituents from plastics, as well as toxic additives, which may enter in the food chain, representing a possible hazard to human health and potentially affecting the fauna and flora in the environment. In relation to their persistence in soil, the list of soil-inhabiting, plastic-eating bacteria, fungi and insect is increasing daily. One of the main ecological functions attributable to MPs is related to their function as vectors for microorganisms through the soil. However, the main ecological effect of NPs (limited to the fraction size < than 50 nm) is their capacity to pass through the membrane of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Soil biota, particularly earthworms and collembola, can be both MPs and NPs carriers through soil profile. The use of molecular techniques, especially omics approaches, can gain insights into the effects of MPs and NPs on composition and activity of microbial communities inhabiting the soil and into those living on MPs surface and in the gut of the soil plastic-ingesting fauna.

However, due to limitations and variations in sampling, analytical measurement methods, and the different units used for reporting data, reliable comparisons between studies in the Gulf region and internationally are not straightforward. This study proposes standardized protocols for marine sediment, seawater, marine biota and aerosol (1) sampling, (2) sample processing, (3) sample identification and (4) reporting units to be used. An attempt has been made to highlight the limitations of the widely employed strategies for sampling microplastics in seawater, where a large portion of the microplastics is not sampled due to the mesh sizes used. The issues with the processing of biota samples and aerosols are likewise addressed, and recommendations are also made for standardization of units for reporting microplastic quantification. Protocols for collection of bottom sediments and aerosols are also proposed. These are the environmental matrixes for which there are no harmonized protocols in the Gulf region; hence if a standardized approach is adopted, it will enable and improve comparisons between the studies within this region and can be useful for similar studies in other marine areas as well.

In this paper we compared the propensity and relative importance of synthetic polymer microparticles [glassy polystyrene (PS) and rubbery polyethylene (PE)] and silica glass particles (SG) to act as vectors for hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) into fish after ingestion. Particles were spiked with three HOCs [17Î±-ethinylestradiol, chlorpyrifos and benzo(Î±)pyrene], which differ in hydrophobicity and induce well-known biomarker responses. Three-spined stickleback were exposed to 8 different diets: control diets (1), diets with non-spiked particles (2â€“4), diets containing a mixture of particles spiked with 3 model contaminants (5â€“7) and, finally, diets loaded with only the chemical mixture (8), for 14 days. Chemical sorption onto the particles was quantified and chemical transfer into the fish was investigated via biomarkers (CYP1a, ERÎ±, VTG, and AChE) in fish intestine, liver and brain and quantification of HOCs in fish muscle. Results demonstrated particle-mediated chemical transfer of moderately hydrophobic contaminants into fish. While PS and PE particles mediated higher chemical transfer and tissue accumulation of 17Î±-ethinylestradiol and chlorpyrifos than SG, the overall chemical transfer was found to be very low. The present work suggested that chemical sorption, desorption and subsequent transfer of chemicals in vivo depends on multiple interconnected factors, including physicochemical properties of particles and contaminants, as well as toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic interactions. The biomarker approach was, however, suboptimal for assessing chemical transfer when addressing particle-associated chemical mixtures.

No signal peptide was found in any of the four GST proteins, indicating that they were cytosolic GST. A highly conserved glutathione (GSH) binding site (G-site) occurred in the N-terminal sequence, and a substrate binding site (H-site), interacting non-specifically with the second hydrophobic substrate, was present in the C-terminal. A Tyr residue, for the stabilization of GSH, was found to be conserved in the analysed sequences. The secondary and tertiary structures indicated that these genes possess the typical cytosolic GST structure, including a conserved N-terminal domain with a Î²Î±Î²Î±Î²Î²Î± motif. The Î¼ loop (NVGPAPDYDR and NFIGAEWDR in Dp-GSTm1 and Dp-GSTm2, respectively) was identified between the Î²Î±Î² (Î²1Î±1Î²2) and Î±Î²Î²Î± motifs (Î±2Î²3Î²4Î±3) in the N-terminal domain. The expressions of Dp-GSTs1, Dp-GSTs2, and Dp-GSTm1 were higher in other age groups compared to the newly-born neonates (1 d); however, the expression of Dp-GSTm2 first increased and then decreased with age. Gene expression was significantly reduced by high concentration (1 and 2 mg/L) of 75 nm polystyrene nanoplastic. However, nanoplastic exposure at the predicted environmental concentration (1 Î¼g/L) had a low effect. Exposure of mothers to nanoplastic (1 Î¼g/L) elevated the Dp-GSTs2 level in their neonates.

They are consumed at a staggering rate worldwide, with the UK alone consuming around 7 million cups daily, thus annually producing around 30,000 tonnes of paper cup waste. Contrary to popular belief, less than 1 in 400 paper cups is currently recycled in the UK, which is in stark contrast to the waste hierarchy and the European Commission's ambitious Circular Economy Action Plan. Paper cups typically end up in landfill sites or even improperly disposed of, contributing to (micro)plastic waste and potentially polluting the world's oceans. The implications of the latter are not fully known yet and cannot be quantified by existing life cycle impact assessment methods. By employing the life cycle assessment methodology, UK's annual carbon footprint from paper cup consumption was found to be 75 kt of carbon dioxide equivalents, which is similar to that of manufacturing 11,500 mid-size passenger cars. Globally, their environmental footprint was found to be comparable to that of some 1.5 M average European inhabitants, indicating the nature and extent of the single-use plastics problem, which paper cups are just a typical example of. Paper cup recycling could reduce this environmental footprint by up to 40%, whereas switching to reusable cups appears to be more environmentally sustainable, achieving a threefold reduction in carbon emissions, which at global scale is more than twice Malta's annual carbon footprint. Results indicate that consumerism along with small daily choices, such as using reusable cups or bags instead of their disposable counterparts, could play a huge role in climate change. At policy level, no concrete measures to curb the superfluous consumption of paper cups, as well as of other single-use plastic items that are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, have materialised. Furthermore, it appears that decision- and policy-makers tend to step in to curtail wasteful and polluting practices only when environmental problems have started to generate widespread concern, instead of undertaking preventative policy measures.

This study characterized the quantity and morphology of microplastics in different environmental compartments in two large reservoirs along the Colorado River: Lakes Mead and Mohave, within Lake Mead National Recreation Area. To assess microplastic occurrence, surface water and surficial sediment were sampled at a total of nine locations. Sampling locations targeted different sub-basins with varying levels of anthropogenic impact. Las Vegas Wash, a tributary which delivers treated wastewater to Lake Mead, was also sampled. A sediment core (33 cm long, representing approximately 19 years) was extracted from Las Vegas Bay to assess changes in microplastic deposition over time. Striped bass (Morone saxatilis), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis), and Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) were sampled at a subset of locations to assess biological uptake of microplastics. Microplastic concentrations were 0.44â€“9.7 particles/cubic meter at the water surface and 87.5â€“1,010 particles/kilogram dry weight (kg dw) at the sediment surface. Sediment core concentrations were 220â€“2,040 particles/kg dw, with no clear increasing or decreasing trend over time. Shellfish microplastic concentrations ranged from 2.7â€“105 particles/organism, and fish concentrations ranged from 0â€“19 particles/organism.

Recently, the amount of PAHs derived from fuels and from incomplete combustion processes is increasing. In the aquatic environment, oil spills directly cause PAH pollution and affect marine organisms. Oil spills correlate very well with the major shipping routes. Furthermore, accidental oil spills can seriously impact the marine environment toxicologically. Here, we describe PAH toxicities and related bioaccumulation properties in aquatic animals, including invertebrates. Recent studies have revealed the toxicity of PAHs, including endocrine disruption and tissue-specific toxicity, although researchers have mainly focused on the carcinogenic toxicity of PAHs. We summarize the toxicity of PAHs regarding these aspects. Additionally, the bioaccumulation properties of PAHs for organisms, including invertebrates, are important factors when considering PAH toxicity. In this review, we describe the bioaccumulation properties of PAHs in aquatic animals. Recently, microplastics have been the most concerning environmental problem in the aquatic ecosystem, and the vector effect of microplastics for lipophilic compounds is an emerging environmental issue. Here, we describe the correlation between PAHs and microplastics. Thus, we concluded that PAHs have a toxicity for aquatic animals, indicating that we should emphasize the prevention of aquatic PAH pollution. Â© 2020 by the authors.

Introduction of plastic waste into water bodies may lead to many adverse environmental impacts as the plastic debris is very stable and generally requires a longer time to degrade. Over a period of time, bulk plastic debris will slowly degrade into small fragments known as macroplastics (particles size =5mm) and microplastics (particles size &lt;5mm). Accumulation of this newly emerging class of pollutants potentially decreases the effciency of the existing water treatment system. Therefore, improvement on the existing water treatment technique is required. This study aimed at investigating the effect of using the UV-assisted thermo-photocatalytic reaction on the degradation of polypropylene (PP) macro- and microplastics in an aqueous environment for 6 hours. ZnO nanoparticles (&lt;50 nm) were employed as the photocatalyst. 23 Full Factorial design was carried out in order to identify the correlation between the reaction temperature (35-50 Â°C), size of PP plastic (25-100 mm2) and the catalyst dosage (1â€“3 g/L) factors and their infuences on the weight loss of macro/micro-plastics. Maximum plastic weight loss of 7.8 wt% was achieved at 50Â°C, 1 g/L ZnO and 25 mm2 of PP plastic. The interaction between temperature and size must be taken into consideration.

Chemical profiling from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be used to determine aroma-inducing compounds that are specific to this local variant and for quality assessment for food safety. In the meantime, the emerging pollution in the marine environment from persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and microplastics are alarming and threats to food safety. These marine-derived commodities, such as fish pastes may therefore harbour these kinds of pollutants. In this study, Bagoong Balayan samples were subjected to solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 29 compounds were detected that passed the minimum match factor of 80 and 14 of them were common in all collected fish paste samples.

Moreover, we summarize the behavioral, morphological, and physiological responses of aquatic animals to MPs. Ultimately, we analyze the migration and potential biomagnification of MPs among trophic levels in the food chain.

In China, rapid urbanization (over 800 million urban population) has led to multiple anthropogenic pressures that threaten urban freshwater environments. Microplastics (<5 mm) result from intensive production and use of plastic materials, but their effects in urban freshwater environments remain poorly understood. Rising concerns over the ecological effects of microplastics have resulted in increased attention being given to this contaminant in Chinese freshwater systems. Some studies provide quantitative data on contamination loads, but in general relevant knowledge in freshwater environment remains narrow in China, and lacking adequate understanding of threshold levels for detrimental effects. Notably, non-standardized sample collection and processing techniques for point and non-point sources have hindered comparisons of contamination loads and associated risk. Meanwhile, legislative frameworks for managing microplastics in China remain in their infancy. This manuscript critically reviews what is known of the nature and magnitude of microplastic pollution in Chinese freshwater environments, and summarizes relevant Chinese legislation. It provides recommendations for improving the legislative framework in China and identifies research gaps that need to be addressed to improve management and regulatory strategies for dealing with microplastic pollution in Chinese urban freshwater environments.

The method used to identify microplastics in the fishes digestive tract is optical microscopy. Microplastics were found in 19 fish (76%), those identified as fiber is 73%, identified as films is 18%, and identified as fragment 9%. The larger the size of fish the higher the microplastic content of all types. This implies that microplastic bioaccumulation occurs through the food chain. Â© 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AmB loaded PEGylated NLC (AmB-PEG-NLC) were fabricated by hot-melt emulsification followed by high-pressure homogenization (HPH) technique. 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)] (mPEG-2K-DSPE) was used for surface PEGylation. mPEG-DSPE with different PEG molecular weight, 1 K, 2 K, 5 K, 10 K, and 20 K, were screened for formulation stability. Furthermore, the AmB loaded PEGylated (2K) NLC (AmB-PEG2K-NLC) was optimized using Box-Behnken design with respect to the amount of AmB, castor oil, mPEG-2K-DSPE, and number of high-pressure homogenization cycles as the factors; particle size, zeta potential, PDI, entrapment efficiency, and loading efficiency as responses. Stability of the optimized AmB-PEG2K-NLC was assessed over 4 weeks, at 4 Â°C as well as 25 Â°C and effect of autoclaving was also evaluated. AmB-PEG2K-NLC were tested for their in vitro antifungal activity against Candida albicans (ATCC 90028), AmB resistant Candida albicans (ATCC 200955) and Aspergillus fumigatus (ATCC 204305). Cytotoxicity of AmB-PEG2K-NLC was studied in human retinal pigmented epithelium cells. In vivo ocular biodistribution of AmB was evaluated in rabbits, following topical application of PEGylated NLCs or marketed AmB preparations. PEGylation with mPEG-2K-DSPE prevented leaching of AmB and increased the drug load significantly. The optimized formulation was prepared with a particle size of 218 Â± 5 nm; 0.3 Â± 0.02 PDI, 4.6 Â± 0.1% w/w drug loading, and 92.7 Â± 2.5% w/w entrapment efficiency. The optimized colloidal dispersions were stable for over a month, at both 4 Â°C and 25 Â°C. AmB-PEG2K-NLCs showed significantly (p < 0.05) better antifungal activity in both wild-type and AmB resistant Candida strains and, was comparable to, or better than, commercially available parenteral AmB formulations like Fungizoneâ„¢ and AmBisomeÂ®. AmB-PEG2K-NLC did not show any toxicity up to a highest concentration of 1% (v/v) (percent formulation in medium). Following topical instillation, AmB was detected in all the ocular tissues tested and statistically significant (p > 0.05) difference was not observed between the formulations tested. An optimized autoclavable and effective AmB-PEG2K-NLC ophthalmic formulation with at least one-month stability, in the reconstituted state, has been developed.

From an environmental sustainability standpoint, it is important to understand the characteristics, abundance, and environmental fate of plastic debris of various sizes, and these include MPs that are not more easily and readily detected. In this study, we assessed the extent of MPs contamination in the sediments, waters, oysters, and selected fishes found in the rivers and coastal areas of Ticalan, Batangas, which were identified from water quality parameters as Class C and CS, respectively. The MPs were extracted from these samples by chemical digestion of the matrix, series of filtration, and separation by flotation through a density gradient to finally isolate the MPs which were not dissolved by chemical digestion. The isolated samples were imaged by optical microscopy and characterized based on their descriptive attributes. The results showed the presence of microplastics in all the samples tested, which were found mostly in the form of filaments, fragments, films, and pellets â€“ with most showing weathered, degraded, or angular and irregular surfaces. Identification was done through spectral matching of the Fourier transform infrared spectra of isolated fragments with that of known plastics, although identification in some cases is made uncertain by possibility of degradation of the plastics in the environment. The majority of the isolates showed signature absorption bands of the C-H stretching vibrations of polyethylene-based plastics. Â© 2019, Department of Science and Technology.

Composites were obtained from a homogeneous mixture of the powders of the matrix components and the filler using a heated press at a temperature of 420 K and a pressure of 15 MPa. The quenching crystallization mode is the rapid cooling of samples in a water-ice mixture. The results of a study of IR spectra taken with a Fourier spectrometer Varian 640 FT-IR, high-pressure polyethylene composites modified with biological filler, and LDPE + x vol.% FS + y vol.% Fe bio-nanocomposites in the frequency range 4000-400 cm-1 were presented. It was revealed that the introduction of modifiers from fish scales (FS) and metallic nanoparticles (Fe) in LDPE in an optimal amount does not contribute to the appearance of new absorption bands, i.e. it practically does not change the shape of their IR spectrum. This means that the modifier of biological origin is technologically compatible with LDPE. The introduction of fish scale filler to LDPE contributes to a noticeable decrease in the intensity of the formation of C-O groups (1720 cm-1), which is a measure of the oxidative degradation of polymer chains. The results show that the introduction of FS into the structures of high-pressure polyethylene contributes to the formation of an optimal and stable structure, which, in turn, interferes with the intensive development of the photooxidative process caused by UV irradiation.

However, overuse of conventional antibiotics to control the infection raises the emergence of resistant bacteria as well as the presence of residual drugs in animals and the environment. Further efforts are therefore needed to look for new and effective antibacterial agents, such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), for use on the fish farm to replace conventional antibiotics before commercial vaccines against PDP are available. In the present study, the fish-derived AMP, pleurocidin (PLE), was used as an anti-PDP agent. After C-terminal amidation, the resulting amidated PLE peptide, PLE(am), was further encapsulated with the poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) polymer to generate PLG-PLE(am) microparticles that would sustain release of antibacterial PLE(am) and elicit effective protection against PDP in cobia. PLG-PLE(am) microparticles, 4.25â€“5.39 Î¼m in diameter, contained 14.69â€“18.47 Î¼g of entrapped PLE(am) per milligram of dry weight of microparticles and showed 81%~84% entrapment efficiency. The amount of released PLE(am) from PLG microparticles gradually increased over a 28-day triphasic controlled-release period and the released PLE(am) still retained its antibacterial activity. Peritoneal injection with PLG-PLE(am) microparticles further protected all cobia from a lethal peritoneal infection of 2 Ã— 103 CFU PDP (MML-3) and allowed cobia to survive relatively longer (14 days post infection). In conclusion, the sustained release of antibacterial PLE(am) peptide from PLG-PLE(am) microparticles can preserve the antibacterial activity to result in effective protection in cobia. Our study provides notable evidence to indicate the feasibility of using PLG-PLE(am) microparticles as an antibacterial agent against PDP in cobia.

However, causal links between MP and contaminant levels in biota are poorly understood and in situ data are very limited. Here, we investigated whether HOC concentrations in herring muscle tissue (Clupea harengus membras) are related to MP ingestion using fish caught along the West coast of the Baltic Sea. The MP occurrence exhibited a large geographic variability, with MP found in 22.3% of the fish examined, and the population average being 0.9 MP indâˆ’1. However, when only individuals containing MP were considered, the average MP burden was 3.9 MP indâˆ’1. We also found that MP burden decreased with reproductive stage of the fish but increased with its body size. To predict MP abundance in fish guts, we constructed a mass-balance model using literature data on MP in the water column and physiological rates on ingestion and gut evacuation for clupeids of a similar size. The model output was in agreement with the observed values, thus supporting the validity of the results. Contaminant concentrations in the muscle tissue varied substantially across the study area but were unrelated to the MP levels in fish, suggesting a lack of direct links between the levels of HOCs and MP ingestion. Thus, despite their ubiquity, MP are unlikely to have a measurable impact on food intake or the total body burden of hydrophobic contaminants in Baltic herring.

MPs also accumulated in vertebrates from the pond-three-spined sticklebacks and young newts. In terms of particle numbers, this accumulation reached levels nearly as high as in the sediments. The size of the MPs in the pond water and its fauna was quite similar and significantly smaller than the MPs in the sediments. A rough estimate on MPs retention in the pond indicated that MPs were retained at efficiencies similar to that of other particulate materials occurring in the stormwater runoff.

All these factors were included in an analysis to model nurdle dispersion from an accidental spill in Durban Harbour, South Africa, in October 2017. Nurdle sightings on beaches by members of the public are used as indicators of the dispersion which extended over 2000 km of the South African coastline in a period of 8 weeks. Using known oceanographic current structures, satellite imagery, wave data and surface wind drift values of between 5% and 8% of wind speed, good agreement was found between the modelled dispersion and nurdle sightings. In particular, it was found that nurdles remained in specific sections of the coast for long periods, and that sporadic wind events were required to move them into new coastal areas. Such results may also contribute to understanding the dispersal behaviours and strategies adopted by larval stages of marine organisms, particularly fishes, that have pelagic larval durations that extend over weeks to months. The event was recognised as a major pollution incident rivalling other nurdle spillages reported worldwide, and extensive efforts were made to collect the nurdles, particularly along the northern KwaZulu-Natal coast. However, 9 months later, less than 20% had been recovered. The results emphasise the connectivity of different ocean regions, and in particular that pollution of the ocean is not a localised activity. Matter discharged at one point will disperse over a wide area â€“ in this case, significantly further afield than the area of recovery operations.Significance: Wind drift in the upper metre or two of the ocean has been notoriously difficult to quantify, and the spread of nurdles along the South African coastline can only be explained by using drift percentages two or three times the generally accepted value of 3% or less. Nonetheless, it is important to realise that there are substantial differences in dispersion rates between the upper few centimetres of the ocean and that even a metre or two deeper. The rapid manner in which nurdles, and other microplastics, can be dispersed is important in terms of understanding the spread of this form of pollution in the world s oceans. The results also confirm the important role that wind can play in the movement of eggs, larvae and invertebrates and the significance of vertical migrations in and out of the surface layers. Finally, the results confirm many of the accepted coastal current regimes on the east and south coasts of South Africa. Moreover, it is shown that certain sections can have very long residence times, where drifters are only removed under sustained wind conditions. Â© 2019 Academy of Science of South Africa.

The extent to which this might have harmful effects is not clear; however, the widespread encounter rate indicates that substantial quantities of microplastic may be distributed within living organisms themselves as well as in the habitats in which they live. Our understanding about the long-term fate of microplastics is relatively limited. Some habitats such as the deep sea may be an ultimate sink for the accumulation of plastic debris at sea; indeed, some recent evidence indicates quantities in the deep sea can be greater than at the sea surface. It has also been suggested that microplastics might be susceptible to biodegradation by microorganisms; however, this is yet to be established and the prevailing view is that even if emissions of debris to the environment are substantially reduced, the abundance of microplastics will increase over the next few decades. However, it is also clear that the benefits which plastics bring to society can be realized without the need for emissions of end-of-life plastics to the ocean. To some extent the accumulation of microplastic debris in the environment is a symptom of an outdated business model. There are solutions at hand and many synergistic benefits can be achieved in terms of both waste reduction and sustainable use of resources by moving toward a circular economy.

Continuously monitoring these conditions allows patients and healthcare professionals to make informed decisions regarding medication and lifestyle habits for better disease management. Our previously published work has demonstrated that a bulk ionically-cross linked alginate hydrogel containing alginate microparticles encapsulating benzoporphyrin dye and oxidoreductase enzymes can be used as an implantable system for continuous monitoring of glucose and lactate via optical interrogation.12 Alginate is a widely-used biocompatible hydrogel that can be ionically-cross linked by multivalent cations, such as calcium (Ca2+). While alginate hydrogels offer the benefit of mild gelation conditions, they tend to disintegrate over time in bodily fluids as the multivalent cations are replaced by monovalent cations.3 In this work, we investigate a more stable matrix better suited for long-term sensing using poly(elhylene glycol) (PEG), which is widely used in biomedical applications for its high biocompatibility, stability, and anti-fouling properties. Pairing PEG with thiol-vinyl sulfone click-chemistry (PEG-SH-VS) allows for rapid and controlled covalent crosslinking under mild conditions, resulting in stable bulk hydrogels.4 We hypothesized that incorporating sensing alginate microparticles into a PEG-SH-VS hydrogel would provide an improved platform for long-term, continuous monitoring.

Nevertheless, some generalizations are possible as reported in multiple studies on: the composition and shapes of MPs; their numbers in waters, effluents and sediments; the effect of wastewater treatment on MP removal; contaminant adsorption to MPs; biological effects of MP ingestion; optimal analytical methods; and the importance of recognizing how sampling and analyses influences results and conclusions. In conclusion: Standard methodologies are needed; Ecological impacts appear minimal due to low exposures and the relative dominance of natural food sources; and the need for research on MPs smaller than 300 microns.

From these very high production volumes ever larger quantities are found in the environment. There the plastics degradate to microplasticity and spread ubiquitously in the world. The present work deals with the possible uptake of microplastic particles in human organisms. For the detection of these plastic particles, an extraction method was developed and validated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biological materials consist of human blood (healthy volunteers, nâ€Š=â€Š4) and different tissues of pigs and cattles. Various lysis solutions were tested for degradation efficiency of biological material and for effects on the plastics. The mass loss, surfaces and structure variations as well as the physicochemical spectrum of the material were observed after treatment by atomic force (AFM) and electron microscopy (EM) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR). RESULTS: The different plastic types as polyamide (PA), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) could be clearly differentiated and identified by FTIR. Regarding the surface control, especially PVC showed detectable alterations: After extraction an irregular surface structure caused by protuberances or bubbles could be observed. However, instead of these alterations an equivalent count of plastic particles was found in correlation to the applied plastic amount (recovery rate overall was 99,12Â±0,67%). CONCLUSION: The applied method can be used for plastic extractions from human or animal tissues without remarkable effects on the plastics.","Cited By :3 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Several drugs that have failed clinical trials have shown inefficient and inadequate delivery to target cells. Anabolic growth factors are one class of such drugs that could be disease-modifying if delivered directly to chondrocytes, which reside deep within dense, anionic cartilage tissue. To overcome this biological barrier, we conjugated a growth factor to a cationic nanocarrier for targeted delivery to chondrocytes and retention within joint cartilage after direct intra-articular injection. The nanocarrier uses reversible electrostatic interactions with anionic cartilage tissue to improve tissue binding, penetration, and residence time. Amine terminal polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers were end functionalized with variable molar ratios of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to control surface charge. From this small family of variably PEGylated dendrimers, an optimal formulation showing 70% uptake into cartilage tissue and 100% cell viability was selected. When conjugated to insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), the dendrimer penetrated bovine cartilage of human thickness within 2 days and enhanced therapeutic IGF-1 joint residence time in rat knees by 10-fold for up to 30 days. In a surgical model of rat osteoarthritis, a single injection of dendrimer-IGF-1 rescued cartilage and bone more effectively than free IGF-1. Dendrimer-IGF-1 reduced width of cartilage degeneration by 60% and volumetric osteophyte burden by 80% relative to untreated rats at 4 weeks after surgery. These results suggest that PEGylated PAMAM dendrimer nanocarriers could improve pharmacokinetics and efficacy of disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs in the clinic.

This study investigated the occurrence and composition of microplastics in the sea-surface water and sought evidence of ingestion by zooplankton. Surface seawater was collected using a stainless-steel bucket and sieved directly through a stainless-steel sieve (250-Âµm mesh), while a 500-Î¼m mesh net was towed horizontally to collect zooplankton, at 11 georeferenced stations off the Kenyan coast in February 2017, on board the national research vessel RV Mtafiti. Microplastic particles were sorted and characterised using an Optika dissecting microscope. Polymer types were identified using an ALPHA Platinum attenuated total reflectionâ€”Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometer. A total of 149 microplastic particles, with an average abundance of 110 particles mâ€“3, were found in the surface seawater. A total of 129 particles were found ingested by zooplankton groups, where Chaetognatha, Copepoda, Amphipoda and fish larvae ingested 0.46, 0.33, 0.22 and 0.16 particles ind.â€“1, respectively. Filaments dominated both the surface-water microplastics and the ingested microplastics, contributing 76% and 97% to those compositions, respectively. White particles were prevalent in the water (51%), whereas black was the colour found most commonly (42%) across the zooplankton groups. The sizes of particles that were in the water were in the range of 0.25â€“2.4 mm, and those ingested ranged between 0.01 and 1.6 mm. Polypropylene was predominant in the surface water, whereas low-density polyethylene was the most-ingested polymer type. The results provide the first documented evidence of the occurrence, composition and ingestion of microplastics by zooplankton in Kenya's marine environment, indicating that microplastics have the potential to enter pelagic food webs and cause pollution in the study area.

Non-synthetic and semi-synthetic microfibers are infrequently documented and not typically included in marine environment impact analyses, resulting in underestimation of a potentially pervasive and harmful pollutant.

Open ocean samples showed consistently higher densities than coastal samples, with the highest concentrations found in the polar oceans (n = 51), confirming previous empirical and theoretical studies. Particles were predominantly microfibers (91%) and 0.1â€“1.5 mm in length (77%), a smaller size than those captured in the majority of surface studies.

Historically, plastic production has increased tremendously to over 250 million tonnes by 2009 with an annual increased rate of 9%. In 2015, the global consumption of plastic materials was reported to be > 300 million tonnes and is expected to surge exponentially. Because plastic polymers are ubiquitous, highly resistant to degradation, the influx of these persistent, complex materials is a risk to human and environmental health. Because microplastics are principally generated from the weathering or breakdown of larger plastics (macroplastics), it is noteworthy and expedient to discuss in detail, expatiate, and tackle this main source. Macro- and microplastic pollution has been reported on a global scale from the poles to the equator. The major problem of concern is that they strangulate and are ingested by a number of aquatic biota especially the filter feeders, such as molluscs, mussels, oysters, from where it enters the food chain and consequently could lead to physical and toxicological effects on aquatic organisms and human being as final consumers. To this end, in order to minimise the negative impacts posed by plastic pollution (macro- and microplastics), a plethora of strategies have been developed at various levels to reduce and manage the plastic wastes. The objective of this paper is to review some published literature on management measures of plastic wastes to curb occurrence and incidents of large- and microplastics pollution in the marine environments.

The present work presents an immune gene expression method for evaluation of gill disturbance and sets a baseline for the mechanical influence on fish gills of chemically inert spherical particles. The method may be applied to investigate particle impact at different combinations of temperature, fish size, water quality and particle composition. Spherical polystyrene particles (diameters 0.2 Î¼m, 1 Î¼m, 20 Î¼m, 40 Î¼m and 90 Î¼m) were adopted as the particle model and the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fingerlings and wildtype zebrafish (Danio rerio) as fish models.

Upon entering a new epoch, the Anthropocene defined by human-driven influences on earth systems, and with the recognition that plastic pollution is one of the hallmarks of this new age, remarkably little is known about the presence, sources, and fate of plastics (and microplastics (MPs)) within African waters. Research in marine regions, most notably around the coast of South Africa, describes the occurrence of MPs in seabirds and fish species. More recently environmental sampling studies in the same area have quantified plastics in both the water column and sediments. However, despite Africa containing some of the largest and deepest of the worldâ€™s freshwater lakes, including Lakes Victoria and Tanganyika as part of the African Great Lakes system, and notable freshwater rivers, such as the River Congo and the Nile, the extent of MPs within the inland waters remains largely unreported. In the only study to date to describe MP pollution in the African Great Lakes, a variety of polymers, including polyethylene, polypropylene, and silicone rubber, were recovered from the gastrointestinal tracts of Nile perch (Lates niloticus) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fished from Lake Victoria. The likely sources of these plastics were considered to be human activities linked to fishing and tourism, and urban waste. In this chapter we discuss the need for research focus on MPs in Africa and how what has been described in the coastal regions and other freshwater environments can be applied to inland African waters. The aforementioned study in Lake Victoria is used to exemplify how small-scale investigations can provide early indications of MP pollution. Lastly we discuss the current challenges and future needs of MP research in African freshwaters.

Most plastic, including microplastic that enters the sea, originates from land-based sources, such as sewage and storm water, or ocean-based sources, including discarded and lost fishing items. Microplastics have been defined as plastic particles with size < 5 mm in diameter, which can be divided into primary microplastics and secondary microplastics. Primary microplastics are most commonly found in industrial, domestic cleaning products and synthetic textiles, while secondary microplastics are usually fragmented from larger plastic debris via weathering, ultraviolet degradation, or biodegradation. Microplastics have been found in the open-sea sediments, deep-sea sediments, and beach sediments worldwide. Microplastics have been found in Europe, Asia, America, India, and even polar regions, and East Asia has been identified as a potential hot spot. Due to their biodegradation-resistant properties, microplastics can persist and accumulate in the marine environment. Thus, it can cause physical and chemical effects on various marine organisms after ingestion. Microplastics can be a vector for the absorption of hydrophobic organic pollutants and heavy metals and potentially transfer of these compounds through the food web. This review summarizes and provides updated data on the sources and occurrence of microplastics in the marine environment, as well as the fate and effects on marine organisms. Finally, recommendations such as legislation reinforcement, raising awareness through education, and a microplastic remediation approach by applying microbes were suggested to control the sources of plastic entering the marine environment.

Oceans, aquifers, rivers, lakes, and groundwater are being polluted at an unprecedented rate. This directly affects not only the health of an increasingly higher number of human communities but ecosystems of other living organisms [1]. Industrial and agricultural processes are responsible due to the continuous discharge of large volumes of wastewaters to these aquatic environments [2][3]. Some of the most common discharged pollutants include pathogens, excess nutrients, suspended solids and sediments, pesticides, plastics, fertilizers, acids, detergents, phenols, minerals, and heavy metals [4][5]. The annual production of synthetic dyes or azo dyes approaches 70 million tons [6]. These xenobiotic chemicals stand as one of the major sources of water pollution, they are relatively simple to synthesize, soluble in water and their natural occurrence is rare [7][8][9]. Azo dyes find applications in various industries including textiles, leather goods, paper, plastics, foodstuffs, cosmetics and candles [10][11]. From them, the vivid colors develop, most notably yellow, orange and red [11]. In recent years, the growing demand of these products has in turn increased the production of dyes and consequently the amount of waste [9]. Despite the industry's efforts to couple wastewater treatment processes to their manufacturing plants, 90% of reactive textile dyes entering activated sludge sewage treatment plants will pass through unchanged and will be eventually discharged to rivers [12][8]. As a result, between 30 to 150 thousand tons of dyes are discharged into water bodies, soil and aquatic ecosystems annually [13][6]. The continuous exposure to azo dyes is suspected to be harmful for living organisms [6]. Water sources contaminated by these compounds have low penetration of sunlight and oxygen, which is essential for the survival of various aquatic organisms [13]. Moreover, the anaerobic degradation entails sub-products of high biological toxicity that may end up in the food chain. An important number of dyes are made of known carcinogens and toxics, such as benzidine and other aromatic compounds, which main effects to humans include damage to ADN and proteins [8][13][11]. Current regulations in Europe, China, Taiwan, Korea and Japan limit the discharge of synthetic dyes to approximately 30 parts per million when used in textiles and leather items that could have prolonged contact with the skin [11]. Accordingly, there has been a recent effort to implement more stringent effluent treatment regulations that enforce industry to find methods to lower the color level in their wastewater prior to discharging into surface waters [11][13]. The primary methods to remove azo compounds are coagulation/flocculation, adsorption, precipitation, flotation, membrane filtration, bioflocculants treatments, ion pair extraction, ultrasonic mineralization, electrolysis, ion exchange, advanced oxidation processes, sonication, photocatalysis, and ozonation [6][7][13]. A major limitation of this processes is however, their simultaneous dependence on both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. This leads to costly processes and/or extremely toxic byproducts [10][20]. Additionally, the biocatalytic degradation of azo dyes and wastewater treatment via laccase has been previously described in different contributions [9][12][7]. Laccase is an oxidoreductase enzyme, capable of oxidizing phenolic compounds into phenoxyl radicals, with the aid of 4 copper electrons in its structure [9][7]. The enzyme promotes decolorization in azo dyes, due to the presence of aromatic polyphenolic moieties in their structures [7]. Here we explore the design and manufacture of a microreactor to enable the enzyme-based degradation of Azo dyes. Laccase molecules for the biodegradation of azo compounds were covalently immobilized on amino-terminated silanized magnetite (Fe3O4). Silanization was conducted with 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) while laccase molecules were conjugated via imine bonds with the aid of glutaraldehyde as crosslinker. We hypothesize that a torus microreactor is suitable for maximizing biodegradation processes due to the absence of dead volume, efficient mixture of reagents and the continuous reaction loop allowed by the toroidal shape [21]. Additionally, the strong magnetic response of magnetite allows the application of magnetic fields to maintain the nanoparticles suspended during the treatment process and maximize contact between the components. A first attempt for find an optimal configuration for the micro-torus reactor was explored in silico with the aid of Comsol MultiphysicsÂ® by analyzing mixing patterns and fluid dynamics. This was accomplished by coupling the CFD and particle tracing modules. Device prototyping was conducted in polymethyl methacrylate using a laser cutter system and commercially available fittings for the assemblage and subsequent testing. Currently, a spectrophotometry assay is performed before and after to evaluate the degradation achieved with the process. Finally, to monitor the extent degradation of azo molecules in an in-line and real-time manner, the device was instrumented with an in situ spectrophotometry system. Functionalization of nanoparticles surfaces in conjunction with torus microreactors appear well suited for degradation and/or capture of other pollutants of concern.

Over 300 million tons of plastic is produced annually and around 75% of all marine litter is plastic. Plastic litter is widespread in aquatic ecosystems and comes from a variety of sources. Once in the environment, plastic can fragment due to exposure to UV light, heat and abrasion; this can lead to the formation of microplastic (< 5 mm). Plastic debris can be harmful to wildlife as a consequence of ingestion and entanglement. There are also concerns about the transfer of chemicals by plastic to organisms upon ingestion, but there is currently little evidence to indicate that plastics provide a major vector for chemical transfer in the environment. Plastic debris also has a range of negative effects for commercial fisheries, maritime industries and tourism. There is also emerging evidence of negative consequences for human well-being. While it is clear that plastics bring many societal benefits, these can largely be achieved without the need for the accumulation of litter in the environment. A focus on solutions and behavior change right along the supply chain is of critical importance to address this problem. It is therefore vital to understand the various sources, forms and impacts of plastic in the environment.

Especially the fragmentation and vertical transport processes of oceanic plastic are poorly understood. However, whereas fragmentation rates are unknown, information on plastic emissions, concentrations of plastics in the ocean surface layer (OSL) and fragmentation mechanisms is available. Here, we apply a systems engineering analytical approach and propose a tentative 'whole ocean' mass balance model that combines emission data, surface area-normalized plastic fragmentation rates, estimated concentrations in the OSL, and removal from the OSL by sinking. We simulate known plastic abundances in the OSL and calculate an average whole ocean apparent surface area-normalized plastic fragmentation rate constant, given representative radii for macroplastic and microplastic. Simulations show that 99.8% of the plastic that had entered the ocean since 1950 had settled below the OSL by 2016, with an additional 9.4 million tons settling per year. In 2016, the model predicts that of the 0.309 million tons in the OSL, an estimated 83.7% was macroplastic, 13.8% microplastic, and 2.5% was < 0.335 mm 'nanoplastic'. A zero future emission simulation shows that almost all plastic in the OSL would be removed within three years, implying a fast response time of surface plastic abundance to changes in inputs. The model complements current spatially explicit models, points to future experiments that would inform critical model parameters, and allows for further validation when more experimental and field data become available.

In the initial state, the following structural components are present in the rail head: plate-pearlite grains (relative content 0.7); mixed ferriteâ€“carbide grains (0.25); and grains of structure-free ferrite. After experiencing a passed tonnage of 691.8 million t, this state only remains beyond a depth of 10 mm. At that depth, a large quantity of bend extinction contours is observed. That indicates elastoplastic distortion of the materialâ€™s crystal lattice. The stress concentrators in the steel are intraphase and interphase boundaries of the ferrite and pearlite grains, cementite and ferrite plates in pearlite colonies, and globular cementite and ferrite particles. Structural transformations are observed at the macro level: microcracks appear, running at acute angles from the surface to a depth of 140 Î¼m; and a decarburized layer is formed. At the micro level, elastoplastic stress fields are formed, and the cementite plates in the pearlite colonies break down. The stress concentrators in that case are intraphase and interphase boundaries of the ferrite and pearlite grains, cementite and ferrite plates in pearlite colonies, and globular cementite and ferrite particles. In structure-free ferrite grains, cementite nanoparticles are formed. The results are compared with the evolution of the structural and phase states at the surface of a recess in bulk-quenched rail as the rail is subjected to gross loads of 500 million t: the transformation of the structural and phase states in the surface layers is more pronounced. Plate pearlite is characterized by solution of the cementite plates. That leads to the formation of chains of globular carbide particles at the sites of the cementite plates. This may be associated with transfer of the carbon atoms from the cementite lattice to dislocations.

With recent estimates indicating that the mass of plastic released to the marine environment may reach 250 million metric tons by 2025, the effects of plastic on our oceans are set to increase. Distribution of microplastics, those plastics measuring less than 5 mm, are of increasing concern because they represent an increasing proportion of marine litter and are known to interact with species in a range of marine habitats. The local abundance of microplastic is dependent on a complex interaction between the scale of local plastic sources and prevailing environmental conditions; as a result, microplastic distribution is highly heterogeneous. Circulation models have been used to predict plastic distribution; however, current models do not consider future variation in circulation patterns and weather systems caused by a changing climate.

This study aims to address previously noted issues with methods that use aggressive extraction treatments or optical microscopy identification techniques alone. Pulsed ultrasonic extraction with ultrapure water was used to remove microplastics from fish stomachs without dissolving the stomach tissues or microplastics. The technique is relatively simple and minimizes issues with hazardous disposal and laboratory safety. Microplastics were characterized using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy plus energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) micro-spectroscopy, and Raman micro-spectroscopy (RMS). These methods were demonstrated successfully on laboratory fish exposed to reference microplastics and on ocean surface trawl and fish samples taken from subtropical gyres. Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and blended PE + PP microplastics were detected in the stomachs of ocean-caught lanternfish, with the majority consisting of PE. One nearly empty lanternfish stomach contained a long PE fiber that appeared to block the digestive tract. Minor amounts of fat, proteins, and carbohydrates were detected by FTIR on many microplastic surfaces. The Pacific Ocean trawl samples yielded similar plastic compositions as the fish stomachs, plus one polystyrene particle. Of the 115 ocean particles analyzed by FTIR (15 Î¼m to 5 mm), 25 particles were microplastics (600 Î¼m to 5 mm). The microplastic PE + PP copolymer blends were the most visibly degraded of the four observed types. FTIR and SEM/EDS identified micro-shell pieces in the ocean fish stomachs that resembled microplastics by optical microscopy alone.

Blood biochemical analysis indicated that exposure to 0.4Â mgÂ Lâˆ’1 paraquat and mixture of paraquat and micro-plastics was followed by an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activities and glucose levels. The activity of ALP and CPK showed a significant increase in fish treated with 2Â mgÂ Lâˆ’1 micro-plastics. No significant changes were observed in glucose level, AST, ALT, and LDH activities in fish exposed to micro-plastics. Exposure to paraquat and/or micro-plastics resulted in a significant decrease in total protein, globulin, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and Î³-glutamyl transferase activity. When fish were exposed to paraquat or paraquat and micro-plastics, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities increased significantly compared to the control group. Treating fishes with a mixture of paraquat and 2Â mgÂ Lâˆ’1 micro-plastics caused a significant increase in albumin levels. However, a significant decrease in the albumin level was observed after exposure to paraquat or micro-plastics. Creatinine levels increased after exposure to paraquat and/or micro-plastics. The results indicate that increased doses of micro-plastics in water significantly increased toxic effects of paraquat in fish. Finally, these data support the hypothesis that changes in blood biochemical parameters were induced by exposure to paraquat and/or micro-plastics.

The cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of TiO2 NPs have been examined in peripheral blood lymphocytes in polyposis coli and colon cancer patients as well as healthy individuals. Physicochemical characterisation of TiO2 NPs involved: Dynamic light scattering (size distribution from 104 nm in ddH2O to 1303 nm in RPMI), Zeta potential (âˆ’28.7 mV) and SEM (average size 34 nm) measurements. Cells were exposed to nanoparticle concentrations ranging from 10 to 80 Î¼g/ml. Techniques used were: The Comet assay, the Micronucleus assay and the Micronucleus assay with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Concentration dependent effects of TiO2 NPs in both patient groups and healthy individuals were observed in the Comet assay, when OTM and % Tail DNA parameters were examined. Also the frequency of micronuclei (MN) in binucleated cells was increased in a concentration-dependent manner. Experiments revealed that polyposis coli and colon cancer patients had a higher level of DNA damage in the Comet assay and a higher number of MN than healthy individuals. Thus, TiO2 NPs induced concentration-dependent increases of damage, regardless of confounding factors, differentially in patients and healthy controls.

Microplastics are found in most commonly utilized products (primary microplastics), or may originate from the fragmentation of larger plastic debris (secondary microplastics). The material enters the marine environment through terrestrial and land-based activities, especially via runoffs and is known to have great impact on marine organisms as studies have shown that large numbers of marine organisms have been affected by microplastics. Microplastic particles have been found distributed in large numbers in Africa, Asia, Southeast Asia, India, South Africa, North America, and in Europe.

Furthermore, the control measures discussed are those mapped out by both national and international environmental organizations for combating the impact from microplastics. Identifying the main sources of microplastic pollution in the environment and creating awareness through education at the public, private, and government sectors will go a long way in reducing the entry of microplastics into the environment. Also, knowing the associated behavioral mechanisms will enable better understanding of the impacts for the marine environment. However, a more promising and environmentally safe approach could be provided by exploiting the potentials of microorganisms, especially those of marine origin that can degrade microplastics.

Port and maritime revenues ($430 million/yr), ferries ($175 million/yr), cruise ship expenditure ($1025 million/yr), major foreshore events such as New Year's Eve and the Sydney Festival ($400 million/yr), and also income from culture, heritage, arts and science (over $33 million/yr) inject considerable funds into the Australian economy. Notably, proximity to the harbour enhances Sydney domestic real estate capital by an estimated $40 billion, equivalent to $3775 million/yr and biological ecosystem services were valued at $175 million/yr. Here we provide i) a synthesis of our current understanding of the natural, social, and economic resources of Sydney Harbour, ii) the threats and pressures these resources face, and finally iii) how a new marine management framework is being used to address these threats to the natural, social and economic wellbeing of Sydney Harbour.

The Edmonton protocol of islet transplantation has shown proof of principle of long term survival of islets in type I diabetic patients, leading to insulin prick free life. Copious volume of literature exists on the use of mammalian islets, especially of porcine origin for diabetes reversal in humans with follow-up studies upto 10 yrs. There is an obvious lack of pre-clinical results and data in the pig-to-primate model. The difficulty is in reproducing regularly the successful porcine islet isolation. Although some of the parameters have been taken, making xenotransplantation an attractive and viable alternative therapy. However, scarcity of islets is the main hurdle in the success of islet transplantation programs. Since the islet cell receptor and the insulin molecule have remained conserved throughout the evolution of vertebrates, we reviewed islet studies from other vertebrates especially, jawless fish, cartilaginous as well as bony fishes and chick islets. The similarities of chick B islets with human islets in terms of Streptozotocin insensitivity and retention of glucose responsiveness by new born chick islets tempted us to hypothesize the use of fish and chick islets as alternative sources for transplantation to reverse experimental diabetes. Since ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, the islets recovered from lower vertebrates are likely to be less immunogenic and may open possibility of using them without immunosuppression. Complementing xenotransplantation, nanotechnology offers an excellent module for addressing the diabetes problem from detection and treatment points of view.

The analyses were based on gut contents. The identification was based on a multi-analytic approach, comprising morphological features (including morphometric analysis) and molecular genetics (DNA barcoding method). Remains of a number of anthropogenic, inorganic materials (microplastic fibres, plastic bags and cartons) appeared regularly in the guts of deep-sea fish (e.g., in Trachyrhynchus scabrus and Mora moro), though always at low occurrence (9.1% of fish at most) and negligible weights (&lt; 2%W of diet). In our sampling, covering an area of ca. 12 km2, large food falls contribute only a little to fish diets by weight, W, e.g., in shark diets they represented 4.5%W for Centroscymnus coelolepis and 11%W for Galeus melastomus. However, the importance of food falls (e.g., cetacean blubber and carcharhinid shark remains) was substantial locally (up to 70.8%W of C. coelolepis diet) particularly near canyons. The arrival of livestock remains (beef flesh, goat ribs and vertebrae) was shown by molecular analyses to contributed to deep-sea shark diets (ca. 5.5%W) comparably to natural food falls. These remains, which originate from human activity, may locally alter the food webs of oligotrophic environments like that of the deep Mediterranean. Food falls of both natural and anthropogenic origin were mainly found in fish collected close to canyon axes. The only cetacean fall documented in the deep Balearic Basin was also near a canyon, the carcass of a small (ca. 1.2 m) striped dolphin, Stenella coeruleoalba, collected in a haul at 1750 m off Barcelona.

Microcarriers containing an mature microorganism culture can replace in situ biofilms in microfluidic bioprocesses to reduce the startup duration and facilitate the replenishment of functional microorganisms. This study examines the effects of particulate solutes (polystyrene (PS) microparticles, Chlorella vulgaris, and Escherichia coli) on polyelectrolyte solution properties (zeta potential, contact angle, and interfacial tension) and droplet/microcarrier formation. The results indicated that, except for interfacial tension and shear stress, the colloidal stability and morphology of particulate solutes should also be considered when generating droplets. A particulate solute resulting in a dispersed phase with colloidal stability was beneficial for the predictable droplet generation. A particulate solute increasing the affinity between the disperse phase and the channel wall hastened the droplet generation to shift from the dripping region to the jetting region. Adding particulate solutes with consistent size and morphology into the dispersed phase was less likely to affect the droplet formation and the droplet size. In this study, adding PS microparticles and C. vulgaris into a diallyldimethylammonium chloride (DDA) solution resulted in a more hydrophilic solution and higher interfacial tension compared with adding DDA solution alone. These particulate solutes also tended to cause incipient colloidal instability. The incipient instability of the C. vulgaris solution led to various droplet sizes. However, the droplet sizes of the PS microparticle solution, which had solution properties similar to those of the C. vulgaris solution, were more uniform because of the consistent size and morphology of PS microparticles. Adding moderate amounts of E. coli resulted in a more hydrophobic solution, lower interfacial tension, and satisfactory colloidal stability. The droplets containing microorganisms were cured to generate poly-DDA (PDDA) microcarriers, and E. coli cultivated in PDDA microcarriers had the same viability as those cultivated in suspension. However, C. vulgaris cultivated in PDDA microcarriers failed to proliferate possibly due to the blockage of the nutrient intake by the quaternary ammonium cation of DDA.

The supported catalyst is very fit for reduction reactions because the Pt species hardly leaches in a reductive environment (judged just from the leaching data, the catalyst can be recycled over 10 million times). No ripening of the supported PtNPs is found for over 1500 equivalent cycles, as judged from the apparent rate constant. The ready separation, high activity, extremely low metal leakage and high durability make the catalyst promising.

Although as much as 80% of marine debris originates from land, little attention was given to the role of rivers as debris pathways to the sea. Worldwide, not a single great river has yet been studied for the surface microplastics load over its length.

Microplastics were found in all samples, with 892,777 particles km -2 on average. In the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area, a peak concentration of 3.9 million particles km -2 was measured. Microplastics concentrations were diverse along and across the river, reflecting various sources and sinks such as waste water treatment plants, tributaries and weirs.

Recently, we reported that polydisperse colloidal suspension of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) protected the human keratinocytes (HaCaT) against UVB-induced damage, thus indicating their potential for prevention of skin carcinogenesis. Here we sought out to investigate if size controlled the chemopreventive efficacy of AgNPs against UVB-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. Methods: Percent cell viability was examined by WST-1 assay after treating the cells with various doses (1-10 Î¼g/mL) of AgNPs of different sizes (10, 20, 40, 60 and 100 nm) for 12 and 24 h. For protection studies, cells were treated with AgNPs of different sizes at a uniform concentration of 1 Î¼g/mL. After 3 h, cells were irradiated with UVB (40 mJ/cm2) and dot-blot analysis was performed to detect cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) as an indication of DNA damage. Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining the cells with 7-Amino-Actinomycin (7-AAD) and PE Annexin V. Immunoblot analysis was accomplished by processing the cells for protein extraction and Western blotting using specific antibodies against various proteins. Results: The data show that the pretreatment of HaCaT cells with AgNPs in the size range of 10-40 nm were effective in protecting the skin cells from UVB radiation-induced DNA damage as validated by reduced amounts of CPDs, whereas no protection was observed with AgNPs of larger sizes (60 and 100 nm). Similarly, only smaller size AgNPs (10-40 nm) were effective in protecting the skin cells from UV radiation-induced apoptosis. At the molecular level, UVB -irradiation of HaCaT cells led to marked increase in expression of pro-apoptotic protein (Bax) and decrease in anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL), while it remained largely unaffected in skin cells pretreated with smaller size AgNPs (10-40 nm). Conclusions: Altogether, these findings suggest that size is a critical determinant of the UVB-protective efficacy of AgNPs in human keratinocytes.

The present study aimed to (i) characterize the bioaccumulation dynamics of PVP-, PEG-, and citrate-AgNPs, in comparison to dissolved Ag, in Daphnia magna and Lumbriculus variegatus; and (ii) investigate whether parameters of bioavailability and accumulation predict acute toxicity. In both species, uptake rate constants for AgNPs were âˆ¼2-10 times less than for dissolved Ag and showed significant rank order concordance with acute toxicity. Ag elimination by L. variegatus fitted a 1-compartment loss model, whereas elimination in D. magna was biphasic. The latter showed consistency with studies that reported daphnids ingesting NPs, whereas L. variegatus biodynamic parameters indicated that uptake and efflux were primarily determined by the bioavailability of dissolved Ag released by the AgNPs. Thus, principles of BLM and TRA frameworks are confounded by the feeding behavior of D. magna where the ingestion of AgNPs perturbs the relationship between tissue concentrations and acute toxicity, but such approaches are applicable when accumulation and acute toxicity are linked to dissolved concentrations. The uptake rate constant, as a parameter of bioavailability inclusive of all available pathways, could be a successful predictor of acute toxicity.

To further promote the use of this material in clinical applications, its degradation and biosafety were evaluated. This paper describes degradation studies and biosafety evaluations of different block composition ratios (LA/GA = 60/40, 70/30, and 80/20) of the main material, PLGA, for mPEG-PLGA-PLL (PEAL) NPs. The degradation of PEAL NPs was studied by characterizing the change in molecular weight, the chemical composition, and the degradation rate in addition to the pH value, the particle size, the zeta potential, and the lactic acid and lysine contents in degradation solutions by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and 1H NMR. The results show that with prolonged degradation time, the pH, particle size, zeta potential, and molecular weight were reduced and that the lactic acid and lysine contents and the molecular weight distribution were increased. 1H NMR demonstrated that the hydrolysis rate for glycolic units was faster than those for lactic acid and lysine units. The degradation rate of NPs in pH 7.4 PBS was faster than that in pH 5.0 PBS. The degradation rate of PEAL NPs increased as the LA/GA increased from LA/GA = 60/40 to 80/20. Investigations of intracellular protein synthesis, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, 4â€²,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear staining and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in Huh7, L02, and RAW 264.7 cells showed that the PEAL NPs had no effect on protein synthesis or cell membrane integrity and did not induce chromatin agglutination. Although the ROS content was slightly concentration-dependent and time-dependent, the change in content was minimal and diffusely distributed within the cell. After THP-1 cells were induced to differentiate into macrophages, a subsequent incubation with 5 mM PEAL NPs for 24 h did not significantly induce the macrophage release of IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, and TGF-Î²1 compared with the negative control. Embryos that had their chorion removed were coincubated with PEAL NPs to determine if there were any effects on embryonic development. It is known that zebrafish embryos at 10-24 h post-fertilization (hpf) are most sensitive to PEAL NPs. Zebrafish embryos treated with different concentrations of PEAL NPs within this sensitive time frame demonstrated that PEAL NPs have a high level of biosafety. Our work demonstrates that PEAL NPs are safe candidates for use as biodegradable carriers for drug and gene delivery.

So conventional drug therapy is not enough effective on endophthalmitis. Drug delivery systems can decrease drug dose and reduce the drug toxicity. To construct nano controlled-release system of anti-bacterial agents is very important for the treatment of intraocular infectious diseases. Objective: This study was to investigate the toxicology and intraocular pharmacokinetics of intravitreal PNIPAAm-PEO loaded norvancomycinnanoparticles (NV-PNIPAAm-PEO) in normal rabbit eyes. Methods: NV-PNIPAAm-PEO was constructed with the drug-loading rate about 22%, and then the drug gelatin solution (20 g/L) was prepared using normal saline solution. Forty-one New Zealand albino rabbits were randomized divided into experimental group and control group. 20 g/L drug gelatin solution 0.1ml was monocularly injected into the vitreous cavity in the experimental group, and the equal volume of sterilized normal saline solution was used in the control group. In 1day, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after injection, ocular anterior and posterior segments were examined by slit lamp microscope and B-sonography, and electroretinogram (ERG) was recorded and the histopathological examination was performed to evaluate the biotoxicity of the drug. Norvancomycin contents in the cornea homogenate, aqueous humor, vitreous, retinochoroid homogenate were detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. Results: The anterior and posterior segments were normal by the slit lamp microscope and B-sonography 1-28 days after injection of NV-PNIPAAm-PEO. In 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after injection, there were no statistically significant difference in the a-wave latency and amplitude of max-ERG between the two groups, as well as the b-wave amplitude (Pâ‰¤0.05). The histopathological examination showed that the retinal structure was normal in both groups. HPLC assay showed that the norvancomycin level was gradually declined in different eye tissues from 1day through 28 days after injection. Norvancomycin was undetectable in the cornea during the observing duration. The maximal norvancomycin content in the blood plasma was (0.34Â±0.11) mg/L in the second day, and norvancomycin content ranged (0.08Â±0.04)-(2.16Â±0.07) mg/L in the aqueous humor, (0.11Â±0.22)-(2.54Â±0.38) Î¼g/g in the chorioretina, respectively. The drug concentration was (5.65Â±1.14)-(406.69Â±21.05) mg/L in the vitreous, which was higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to the most gram-positive bacteria. Conclusions: The intravitreal injection of 22% NV-PNIPAAm-PEO maintains the therapeutic drug concentration till 21 days in vitreous without the toxic effect on eye tissues, suggesting a great treating potential for intraocular infecting diseases.

Whether researchers design palladium nanoparticles (NPs) or nanoparticles occur as palladium complexes decompose, these structures can serve as central precatalysts in common carbon-carbon bond formation. Palladium NPs are also valuable alternatives to molecular catalysts because they do not require costly and toxic ligands.In this Account, we review the role of ""homeopathic"" palladium catalysts in carbon-carbon coupling reactions. Seminal studies from the groups of Beletskaya, Reetz, and de Vries showed that palladium NPs can catalyze Heck and Suzuki-Miyaura reactions with aryl iodides and, in some cases, aryl bromides at part per million levels. As a result, researchers coined the term ""homeopathic"" palladium catalysis. Industry has developed large-scale applications of these transformations.In addition, chemists have used Crooks' concept of dendrimer encapsulation to set up efficient nanofilters for Suzuki-Miyaura and selective Heck catalysis, although these transformations required high PdNP loading. With arene-centered, ferrocenyl-terminated dendrimers containing triazolyl ligands in the tethers, we designed several generations of dendrimers to compare their catalytic efficiencies, varied the numbers of Pd atoms in the PdNPs, and examined encapsulation vs stabilization. The catalytic efficiencies achieved ""homeopathic"" (TON = 540 000) behavior no matter the PdNP size and stabilization type. The TON increased with decreasing the Pd/substrate ratio, which suggested a leaching mechanism.Recently, we showed that water-soluble arene-centered dendrimers with tri(ethylene glycol) (TEG) tethers stabilized PdNPs involving supramolecular dendritic assemblies because of the interpenetration of the TEG branches. Such PdNPs are stable and retain their ""homeopathic"" catalytic activities for Suzuki-Miyaura reactions for months. (TONs can reach 2.7 Ã— 106 at 80 C for aryl bromides and similar values for aryl iodides at 28 C.) Sonogashira reactions catalyzed by these PdNPs are quantitative with only 0.01% Pd/mol substrate. Kato's group has reported remarkable catalytic efficiencies for mesoporous catalysts formed by polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer polymerizations. These and other mesoporous structures could allow for catalyst recycling, with efficiencies approaching the ""homeopathic"" behavior.In recent examples of Suzuki-Miyaura reactions of aryl chlorides, chemists achieved truly ""homeopathic"" catalysis when a surfactant such as a tetra-n-butylammonium halide or an imidazolium salt was used in stoichiometric quantities with substrate. These results suggest that the reactive halide anion of the salt attacks the neutral Pd species to form a palladate. In the case of aryl chlorides, the reaction may occur through the difficult, rate-limiting oxidative-addition step.

Mortality from DVT is often due to subsequent pulmonary embolism (PE). Precise diagnosis and treatment is thereby essential for the management of DVT. DVT is diagnosed by a thorough history and physical examination followed by laboratory and diagnostic tests. The choice of laboratory and diagnostic test is dependent on clinical pretest probability. Available laboratory and diagnostic techniques mainly involve D-dimer test, ultrasound, venography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The latter two diagnostic tools require high doses of contrast agents including either radioactive or toxic materials. The available treatment options include lifestyle modifications, mechanical compression, anticoagulant therapy, inferior vena cava filter, and thrombolysis/thrombolectomy. All of these medical and surgical treatments have serious side effects including improper clot clearance and increased risk of hemorrhage occurrence. Therefore, research in this field has recently focused on the development of non-invasive and accurate diagnostics, such as ultrasound enhanced techniques and molecular imaging methods, to assess thrombus location and its treatment course.

Hence, the research of an effective vaccine is still a priority. Unfortunately, a safe and efficacious vaccine is not available yet. We have previously demonstrated the capacity of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) to protect mice against an experimental infection with Shigella flexneri. Now, we present results on the capacity of this antigenic complex to confer a longer-term protection by oral or nasal routes when encapsulated into nanoparticles. OMVs were encapsulated in poly(anhydride) nanoparticles (NP) prepared by a solvent displacement method with the copolymer poly methyl vinyl ether/maleic anhydride. OMVs loaded into nanoparticles (NP-OMVs) were homogeneous and spherical in shape, with a size of 148nm (PdI=0.2). BALB/c mice were immunized with OMVs either free or encapsulated in nanoparticles by nasal (20Î¼g or 10Î¼g of OMVs) or oral route (100Î¼g or 50Î¼g of OMVs). All immunized animals remained in good health after administration. Challenge infection was performed intranasally on week 8th with a lethal dose of 5Ã—107CFU/mouse of S. flexneri 2a. The number of dead mice after challenge was recorded daily. Results confirmed the value of OMVs as a vaccine. By oral route, the OMV-vaccine was able to protect independently either the dose or the formulation. When vaccine was delivered by nasal route, encapsulation into NPs resulted beneficial in increasing protection from 40% up to 100% when low dose was administered. These results are extraordinary promising and put in relevance the positive effect of nanoencapsulation of the OMV subcellular vaccine.

Because of this, they have moved swiftly from the research laboratory into the marketplace in applications including: aerospace, automotive, coatings, electronics, energy storage, coatings and paints. Based on the huge interest, enhanced properties as well as ease of production and handling, the European Union is funding a 10 year $1.73 billion coordination action on graphene. South Korea is spending $350 million on commercialization initiatives and the United Kingdom is investing $76 million in a commercialization hub), since many of the current and potential applications of carbon nanotubes may be replaced by graphene at much lower cost. The main objective of this study was to characterize the influence of exfoliated graphene nanoplatelet (xGnP) particle diameter, filler loading and the addition of coupling agents on the mechanical, rheological and thermal properties of xGnP-filled impact modified polypropylene (IMPP) composites. The xGnP nanoparticles used in this research were of three different sizes: xGnP5 with an average thickness of 10 nm, and an average platelet diameter of 5 Î¼n, whereas xGnP15 and xGnP25 have the same thickness but average diameters are 15 Î¼n and 25 Î¼n, respectively. The coupling agent used in this study was polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA). Test results show that nanocomposites with smaller xGnP diameter exhibited better flexural, tensile and impact properties for both neat IMPP and composites containing coupling agent. For composites containing a coupling agent, the tensile and flexural modulus and strength increased with the addition of xGnP. The TGA results indicated that the degradation temperature of IMPP is lowered with the addition of PP-g-MA, indicative of the poor thermal stability of PP-g-MA. However, the thermal stability of the composites increases with xGnP loading because of the high thermal stability of the xGnP. Microscopy, rheology, thermal analysis including dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were also used to study the processing, structure, and properties of the nanocomposites.","Cited By :2 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The Ti thin sheets were surface treated by anodic oxidation of electroplating to achieve good bonding with APC-2 laminates. Nanoparticles SiO2 were dispersed uniformly on the interfaces of APC-2 with the optimal amount of wt 1%. The modified diaphragm curing process was adopted to manufacture the hybrid laminates for minimal impact of production. Basically, the tensile tests at elevated temperature were conducted to obtain the baseline data of mechanical properties, such as strength and stiffness. The results of longitudinal stiffness predicted by the rule of mixtures (ROM) were in good agreement with experimental data; whilst, those ultimate strength predicted by ROM were lower than the measured data. Then, the tension-tension (T-T) constant stress amplitude cyclic tests were performed at elevated temperature to receive the S-N curves, fatigue strength and life. It is a surprise that almost no delaminations were observed in tensile and cyclic tests, even at elevated temperature and over a million cycles.

Methods: 1â€cm diameter cylindrical plastic tubes containing saline solutions and GNPs at 2%, 0%, and 0.5% (by weight), were placed in a vertically stacked geometry and irradiated using a pencilâ€beam of 40 kVp xâ€rays. A Siâ€PIN detector, placed at 90Â° with respect to the beam axis such that it had a view along the longitudinal axes of the tubes, captured the spectrum of scattered and gold Lâ€shell fluorescence photons from the cylinders. Keeping the detector and source positions fixed, the distance from the source to the point of interrogation was kept constant by translation of the stack of tubes vertically and horizontally in steps of 2.5 mm until all tubes were imaged. The resulting gold fluorescence signals were extracted and used to generate a rudimentary 2â€D direct fluorescence image of the tubes. Results: Gold La and LÃŸ fluorescence signals (9.7 and 11.4 keV) were detected with very high signalâ€toâ€background ratios (up to a factor of 3). The direct 2â€D fluorescence image reconstructed from the experimental geometry accurately showed the positions of each tube and relative GNP concentrations. The relative signal strength from each tube had a linear correlation with GNP concentration. The current results were extrapolated to a GNP detection limit on the order of partsâ€perâ€million. Conclusions: 2â€D fluorescence imaging of GNP location and concentration within small objects can be accomplished by detection of gold Lâ€shell fluorescence xâ€rays. The current benchtop experimental setup can be easily adapted for inâ€/exâ€vivo imaging. After further optimization, this setup can be used to image intraâ€tumoral distribution of GNPs in vivo during preâ€clinical animal studies. Â© 2012, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

In addition, nanoparticles (NPs) with high affinity for the circulating amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) forms may induce ""sink effect"" and improve the AD condition. There are also developments in relation to in vitro diagnostics for AD, including ultrasensitive NP-based bio-barcodes, immunosensors, as well as scanning tunneling microscopy procedures capable of detecting AÎ² 1-40 and AÎ² 1-42. However, there are concerns regarding the initiation of possible NP-mediated adverse events in AD, thus demanding the use of precisely assembled nanoconstructs from biocompatible materials.

Techniques refined at the Los Alamos National Laboratory provided information on hypervelocity impacts ofparticles ofknown mass and velocity ranging from 20-1000 nm diameter and 1-100 kin/s. A Van Dc Graaff generator operating at 6 million volts was used to accelerate individual carbonyl iron microspheres produced by a specially designed particle source.

Particles with the desired parameters were then electrostatically directed to a target chamber.

Microplastics that were between 100 and 500Â Î¼m and larger than 1000Â Î¼m in size were predominant in the ponds and nearby lakes, whereas the proportion of microplastics that were smaller than 100Â Î¼m was higher in crab ponds than those in other ponds. Fragments and fibers were the predominant shapes of microplastics in the ponds. The proportion of smaller microplastics in the ponds had a positive correlation with the proportion of fragment microplastics. The results of this study implied that differences in the use of plastics in various types of aquaculture ponds might affect their microplastic pollution characteristics. Microplastics discharged from ponds to nearby lakes through drainage processes require attention in further studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",34118620,

Plastic polymers may contain chemical additives and contaminants, including known endocrine disruptors that may be harmful for the marine organisms, in turn posing potential risks to marine ecosystems, biodiversity and food availability. This study assesses the presence of plastics in the contents of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of a commercial fish species, the Atlantic horse mackerel, Trachurus trachurus, sampled from two different fishing areas of central Mediterranean Sea. Adverse effect of plastics occurrence on T. Trachurus health were also assessed quantifying the liver expression of vitellogenin (VTG), a biomarker for endocrine disruption. A total of 92 specimens were collected and morphometric indices were analysed. A subgroup was examined for microplastics (MPÂ <Â 1Â mm) and macroplastics (MaP >1Â cm) accumulation in the GIT and for VTG expression. Results indicated that specimens from the two locations are different in size and maturity but the ingestion of plastic is widespread, with microplastics (fragments and filaments) abundantly present in nearly all samples while macroplastics were found in the larger specimens, collected in one of the two locations. Spectroscopic analysis revealed that the most abundant polymers in MP fragments were polystyrene, polyethylene and polypropylene, whereas MP filaments were identified mainly as nylon 6, acrylic and polyester. MaP were composed mainly of weathered polyethylene or polypropylene. The expression of VTG was observed in the liver of 60% of all male specimens from both locations. The results of this study represent a first evidence that the ingestion of plastic pollution may alter endocrine system function in adult fish T.

Microplastics (plastic particles < 5Â mm) and nanoplastics (plastic particles < 100Â nm) can interact with organic pollutants already present in the aquatic environment, potentially acting as carriers for pollutants entering organisms and thus influencing the bioavailability and toxicity of those pollutants. In this study, we investigated the transfer kinetics and transgenerational effects of exposure to tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) and polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) in F1 offspring. At 90 days postfertilization, zebrafish (Danio rerio) strain AB was exposed to either TDCIPP (0, 0.47, 2.64, or 12.78Â Î¼g/L) or PS-NPs (10Â mg/L) or their combination for 120 days. The results showed that TDCIPP and PS-NPs accumulated in the gut, gill, head, and liver of the zebrafish in a sex-dependent manner. The presence of PS-NPs promoted the bioaccumulation of TDCIPP in the adult fish and increased the parental transfer of TDCIPP to their offspring. We demonstrate that parental exposure to TDCIPP alone or in combination with PS-NPs induces thyroid disruption in adults, and then leads to thyroid endocrine disruption in their larval offspring. Reduced thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) levels contributed to the observed transgenerational thyroid dysfunction, which inhibited developmental growth and disturbed the transcription of genes and expression of proteins involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis in the F1 larvae. The increased transfer of TDCIPP to the offspring in the presence of PS-NPs also enhanced transgenerational thyroid endocrine disruption, demonstrated by a further reduction in T4 and the upregulation of thyroglobulin (tg), uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (ugt1ab), thyroid-stimulating hormone (tshÎ²), and thyroid hormone receptor (trÎ±) expression in the F1 larvae compared with the effects of parental TDCIPP exposure alone. Overall, our results indicate that the presence of PS-NPs modifies the bioavailability of TDCIPP and aggravates transgenerational thyroid disruption in zebrafish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Gabriel""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Prole,GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext",34058436,

Recreational angling, where many anglers release manufactured baits into freshwater ecosystems, is a widespread activity with important socio-economic implications in Europe. It also represents a potential microplastic pathway into freshwaters that has yet to be quantified. Correspondingly, we analysed three different categories of industrially-produced baits ('groundbait', 'boilies' and 'pellets') for their microplastic contamination (particles 700 Âµm to 5 mm). From 160 samples, 28 microplastics were identified in groundbait and boilies, with a mean concentration of 17.4 (Â±â€‰48.1 SD) MP kg(-1) and 6.78 (Â±â€‰29.8 SD) mg kg(-1), yet no microplastics within this size range were recorded in the pellets. Microplastic concentrations significantly differed between bait categories and companies, but microplastic characteristics did not vary. There was no correlation between microplastic contamination and the number of bait ingredients, but it was positively correlated with C:N ratio, indicating a higher contamination in baits with higher proportion of plant-based ingredients. We thus reveal that bait microplastics introduced accidentally during manufacturing and/or those originating from contaminated raw ingredients might be transferred into freshwaters. However, further studies are needed to quantify the relative importance of this cryptic source of contamination and how it influences microplastic levels in wild fish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",34045532,PMC8160005

In aquatic ecosystems, microplastics are ingested by aquatic animals, affecting their growth and development and resulting in trophic transfer to higher organisms in the food chain. Therefore, consumption of aquatic products is a main primary source of human exposure to microplastics. Recently, aquaculture production has experienced tremendous growth and will exceed production from fish catch soon. Because they constitute an important source of protein in the human food supply, aquaculture products contaminated with microplastics directly affect food quality and safety. The present review summarizes documented studies regarding the occurrence and distribution of microplastics in various aquaculture systems and species and compares microplastic pollution in aquaculture species and captured species. Microplastics in aquaculture environments mainly come from exogenous imports, such as plastic waste and debris from the land, tourism, shipping transportation and atmospheric deposition. In addition, the use of plastic gear and equipment, aquaculture feed and health products, and special aquaculture environments contribute to a higher accumulation of microplastics. We also discuss the adverse effects of microplastics in aquaculture species and the potential health risks of microplastics to humans through the food chain. In summary, this review highlights the effects of microplastic pollution in aquaculture, particularly the ecological impacts on aquaculture species and associated human health implications, and calls for restricted control of microplastics in aquaculture ecosystems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33979917,

Plastic pollution in the oceans has received a lot of news coverage, but there is a significant gap in our knowledge about its effect in estuarine areas and a profound regional bias in available information. Here, we estimated the degree of microplastic pollution, its impact on a selected fish, and its function as a vector for heavy metals in the Ulhas River estuary, which is one of the most fragile, polluted, and anthropogenically impacted estuaries in India. Using mudskipper fish, we have also assessed how the feeding guild and ecomorphological adaptations in the feeding apparatus affected the microplastic intake and life history traits of the fish. Sediment, water and fish samples were collected from three sampling localities (S1, S2 and S3) in the Ulhas River estuary and analysed. Findings showed an increase in microplastic abundance from S1 (suburban) to S3 (urban industrial belt) in sediment (96.67-130.0Â particlesÂ kg(-1)), water (0.28-0.41Â particlesÂ L(-1)) and fish (3.75-6.11 particles per fish). Fragments, followed by pellets and filaments largely contribute to the plastic morphotypes in sediment and water. FTIR analysis revealed polymers of anthropogenic and industrial origin such as polypropylene, Surlyn ionomer, low-density polyethylene, and polyethylene or polybutylene terephthalate. Only filaments were found in the guts of 74% of the mudskippers examined, which may be due to their filter-feeding habit and unique anatomical arrangement of oral structures that effectively filter large microplastic particles. Microplastic abundance showed a strong negative correlation with condition factor, fullness index and hepatosomatic index of fish. SEM-EDS analysis revealed that the microplastic surface topography played an important part in adsorbing heavy metals from a water body containing these contaminants. Results highlight the contamination of vulnerable estuarine habitats, harmful effects on resident biota, and health threats to dependent populations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33975109,

We used Bayesian generalized linear mixed models to determine whether MP ingestion by fishes varies by Food and Agricultural Organization fishing area, trophic level, body size, taxa, and study methodology. After accounting for methodology, strong regional differences were not present, although ingested MP concentrations were slightly different among some FAO areas. According to the reviewed studies, MP concentrations in fish digestive tracts did not increase with either trophic level or body size, suggesting that biomagnification of MPs did not occur, although larger fish were more likely to contain MPs. Researchers reported higher concentrations of MPs in clupeids compared with other commonly studied taxonomic families, which could be due to their planktivorous feeding strategy.

We investigated the effects of polyethylene and polypropylene microplastics purchased as preproduction pellets (referred to as ""preconsumer"") and a mixture of polyethylene and polypropylene collected from the environment (environmental microplastic). Embryo-stage fathead minnows were exposed to either the physical plastic particles and their leachates or the chemical leachates alone at an environmentally relevant (280â€‰particles/L) or high (2800â€‰particles/L) concentration for 14â€‰d. The effects of microplastics differed by polymer type and presence of environmental contaminants, and effects can be driven by the physical particles and/or the chemical leachates alone. Larvae exposed to preconsumer polyethylene experienced a decrease in survival, length, and weight, whereas preconsumer polypropylene caused an increase in weight. Environmental microplastics caused a more drastic increase in length and weight and almost 6 times more deformities as the preconsumer microplastics. Although preconsumer microplastics caused effects only when organisms were exposed to both the particles and the chemical leachates, the environmental microplastics caused effects when organisms were exposed to the chemical leachates alone, suggesting that the mechanism of effects are context-dependent. The present study provides further support for treating microplastics as a multiple stressor and suggests that testing for effects with pristine microplastics may underestimate the true effects of microplastics in the environment.

Despite growing concern about microplastic pollution in freshwater habitats, the literature has not yet addressed effluent-dependent rivers, which derive 100% of their baseflow from effluent. The objective of this study was to document and explore trends in microplastic pollution within the effluent-dependent lower Santa Cruz River near Tucson, Arizona (USA). We examined microplastic concentrations in the water column and benthic sediment and microplastic consumption by mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) at 10 sites along a ~40 km stretch of the lower Santa Cruz River across two time periods: baseflow (effluent only) and post-flood (effluent immediately following urban runoff). In total, across both sampling periods, we detected microplastics in 95% of water column samples, 99% of sediment samples, and 6% of mosquitofish stomachs. Flow status (baseflow vs post-flood) was the only significant predictor of microplastic presence and concentrations in our models. Microplastic fragment concentrations in the water column were higher post-flood, microplastic fiber concentrations in benthic sediment were lower post-flood, and mosquitofish were more likely to have consumed microplastics post-flood than during baseflow. The additional microplastics detected after flooding was likely due to a combination of allochthonous material entering the channel via runoff and bed scour that exhumed microplastics previously buried in the riverbed.

We highlight what is known about microbiota in aquatic ecosystems, with a focus on the interface between water, fish, and marine mammals.

The Cd content in the chorion increased by p-PET due to the adsorption of p-PET on the chorion. By contrast, more f-PET dissociated in culture medium and resulted in low Cd content in the chorion. Given that chorion can effectively block p-PET and f-PET, the Cd accumulation in eggs significantly decreased (pÂ <Â 0.05) under p-PET/f-PET and Cd combined treatment because of the reduction in the bioavailability of Cd. Therefore, p-PET and f-PET decreased the toxicities of Cd on all the target endpoints in this study, and the detoxification effect of f-PET at 72 hpf was more significant than that of p-PET.

The general impact of microplastic exposure on the functional traits of fishes and specifically on eight variables, namely, behaviour, development, fecundity, feeding, growth, health, hatching and survival was explored. Subgroup analyses were performed to detect correlations between the impact of microplastics and the following factors: species, life stage, habitat, water column habitat, day of exposure to microplastics and microplastic size, type and shape. A meta-regression analysis allowed understanding the correlation between the impact of microplastics and the size of organisms. Generally, microplastics have a negative effect on the functional traits of fishes. Feeding and behaviour, followed by growth showed the greatest impact. Among the subgroup analysis, four of the eight variables considered showed a significant difference between groups: species, life stage, microplastic shape and days of exposure to microplastics. Depending on their life stage, organisms may be more sensitive to microplastic pollution. Changes in growth rates, development of early life stage and behavioural patterns in fishes may have a negative effect on the structure and functions of aquatic ecosystem in the long term and consequently affect the ability of aquatic ecosystems to provide ecosystem services and sustain human communities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33638211,

However, when the Raman signal is low and weak, the mapping uncertainty from the individual Raman peak intensity increases and may lead to images with false positive or negative features. For real samples, even the Raman signal is high, a low signal-noise ratio still occurs and leads to the mapping uncertainty due to the high spectrum background when: the target plastic is dispersed within another material with interfering Raman peaks; materials are present that exhibit broad Raman peaks; or, materials are present that fluoresce when exposed to the excitation laser. In this study, in order to increase the mapping certainty, we advance the algorithm to combine and merge multi-images that have been simultaneously mapped at the different characteristic peaks from the Raman spectra, akin imaging via different mapping channels simultaneously. These multi-images are merged into one image via algorithms, including colour off-setting to collect signal with a higher ratio of signal-noise, logic-OR to pick up more signal, logic-AND to eliminate noise, and logic-SUBTRACT to remove image background. Specifically, two or more Raman images can act as ""parent images"", to merge and generate a ""daughter image"" via a selected algorithm, to a ""granddaughter image"" via a further selected algorithm, and to an ""offspring image"" etc. More interestingly, to validate this algorithm approach, we analyse microplastics / nanoplastics that might be generated by a laser printer in our office or home.

To address this gap, we examined cellular uptake, cytotoxicity and mitochondrial effects of 2D MnO(2) nanosheets using an inÂ vitro fish gill cell line to represent a target tissue of rainbow trout, a freshwater indicator species. The data demonstrate cellular uptake of MnO(2) nanosheets into lysosomes and potential mechanisms of dissolution within the lysosomal compartment. MnO(2) nanosheets induced severe mitochondrial dysfunction at sub-cytotoxic doses. Quantitative, single cell fluorescent imaging revealed mitochondrial fission and impaired mitochondrial membrane potential following MnO(2) nanosheet exposure. Seahorse analyses for cellular respiration revealed that MnO(2) nanosheets inhibited basal respiration, maximal respiration and the spare respiratory capacity of gill cells, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced cellular respiratory activity. MnO(2) nanosheet exposure also inhibited ATP production, further supporting the suppression of mitochondrial function and cellular respiration. Together, these observations indicate that 2D MnO(2) nanosheets impair the ability of gill cells to respond to energy demands or prolonged stress. Finally, our data demonstrate significant differences in the toxicity of the 2D MnO(2) nanosheets and their microparticle counterparts.

The MPs were dominated by fibers in terms of shape, black-gray and blue-green in terms of color and cellophane in terms of composition. MPs were found in the gills and guts of the crabs, but not in the muscles. The abundance and size of the MPs in the guts were significantly higher than those in the gills, but there was no significant difference in color or shape. In addition, crab eating patterns have a significant impact on the abundance of MPs in different species. The abundance of MPs in the saprophytic crabs was significantly higher than that in the predatory crabs.

Steel containers with dangerous substances residing in the sea for over 70 years have begun leaking, thus polluting water. For many years, radioactive waste had also been dumped into marine ecosystems, although since 1993 there has been a total ban on such disposal of radionuclides.

The results indicated that the MPs spread and accumulate throughout the food-web fast, and finally to the high trophic level aquatic organisms, Snakehead.

The abundance of MPs in snakehead, mandarin fish, common carp, crucian carp, chub, fingerling, grass carp, mollusc, microzoobenthos, zooplankton increased about 3.97, 2.87, 2.35, 1.8, 1.48, 1.8, 1.86, 1.98, 1.99, 3.49 times of the initial abundance of MPs in them, respectively. Since snakehead exists in the highest trophic level in Baiyangdian Lake ecosystem, the cumulative effect of MPs is the most serious through food web. Furthermore, the accumulation of MPs in different trophic levels has a time delay effect, and the higher the nutrient level is, the more obvious the delay effect is.

MP accumulation was associated with oxidative stress induction, which was inferred by the nitrite and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels. Furthermore, we observed that such stress was not counterbalanced by increase in the assessed enzymatic (total glutathione, catalase and superoxide dismutase) and non-enzymatic (total thiols, reduced glutathione and DPPH radical scavenging activity) antioxidants. The association between high acetylcholinesterase activity and numerical changes in neuroblasts distributed on animals' body surface confirmed MP's neurotoxic potential.

In addition, radiolabeling nanoparticles with a radioactive isotope is of great use in preclinical studies, since it allows the in vivo monitoring of the nanostructure through the acquisition of quantitative images. Therefore, this study aimed to develop, characterize, and evaluate the antitumor activity of a pH-sensitive micelle composed of DSPE-PEG(2000), oleic acid, and DOX.

The pH-sensitivity was confirmed in vitro through a drug release assay. Cytotoxicity studies confirmed that the encapsulation of DOX into the micelles did not impair the drug cytotoxic activity. Moreover, the incorporation of DSPE-PEG(2000)-DTPA into the micelles allowed it radiolabeling with the technetium-99â€‰m in high yield and stability, permitting its use to monitor antitumor therapy. In this sense, the pH-sensitive micelles were able to inhibit tumor growth significantly when compared to non-pH-sensitive micelles and the free drug. in vivo toxicity evaluation in the zebrafish model revealed significantly lower toxicity of pH-sensitive micelles compared to the free drug.

There is a need to further elucidate the potential impact microplastics can impose on aquatic species. In this study, the effects of exposure to polystyrene microplastics on reproductive organs, and the underlying response mechanisms, were investigated using zebrafish Danio rerio. After 21 days of continuous waterborne exposure, no significant difference was observed at the lower concentration of 10Â Î¼g/L. At concentrations above 100Â Î¼g/L, significantly enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was found in both male and female liver and gonads. At the concentration of 1000Â Î¼g/L, significantly increased apoptosis levels were observed in male testes, triggering increased expression of p53-mediated apoptotic pathways; histological alteration in the form of a significant decrease in testis basement membrane thickness was also observed. This study demonstrated that exposure to microplastics can induce molecular responses and histological alterations in fish gonads, implying potential adverse impact on fish reproductive organs. This work provided new insights on the reproductive damage microplastics can cause in fish and have implications in fields of freshwater ecology and environmental toxicology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Included"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome",33297137,

In order to identify the microcystin-LR (MCLR) bioaccumulation and the potential impacts on the early growth of F1 zebrafish (Danio rerio) offspring in the presence of polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs), PSNPs and MCLR were used to expose adult zebrafish for 21days. The exposure groups divided into MCLR (0, 0.9, 4.5 and 22.5Î¼gL(-1)) alone groups and PSNP (100Î¼gL(-1)) and MCLR co-exposure groups. F1 embryos were collected and developed to 120Â h post-fertilization (hpf) in clear water. Compared with the exposure to MCLR only, the combined exposure increased the parental transfer of MCLR to the offspring and subsequently exacerbated the growth inhibition of F1 larvae. Further research clarified that combined exposure of PSNPs and MCLR could reduce the levels of thyroxine (T4) and 3, 5, 3'-triiodothyronine (T3) by altering the expression of hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis-related genes, eventually leading to growth inhibition of F1 larvae. Our results also exhibited combined exposure of PSNPs and MCLR could change the transcription of key genes of the GH/IGF axis compared with MCLR single exposure, suggesting the GH/IGF axis was a potential target for the growth inhibition of F1 larvae in PSNPs and MCLR co-exposure groups.

The estimated density of floating MFs is âˆ¼5900â€¯Â±â€¯6800 items m(-3) in the global ocean; and three patterns of accumulation were predicted by the proposed model: (i) intermediate densities in ocean gyres, Seas of Japan and of Okhotsk, Mediterranean and around the Antarctic Ocean; (ii) high densities in the Arctic Ocean; and (iii) point zones of highest densities inside the Arctic Seas. Coastal areas and upwelling systems have low accumulation potential. At the same time, zones of divergences between westerlies and trade winds, located above the tropical oceanic gyres, are predicted to accumulate MFs. In addition, it is likely that the warm branch of the thermohaline circulation has an important role in the transport of MFs towards the Arctic Ocean, emphasizing that surface water masses are important predictors.

After exposure, microplastic fibers were observed in the gut of zebrafish even at the early life stage, causing length-dependent intestinal damage and toxicities manifested by histopathological changes and biomarker responses. Long microplastic fibers induced more serious effects. They significantly decreased the food intake of zebrafish by 54 %-67 % compared with short microplastic fibers. Metabolomics was conducted to further reveal the metabolic alterations induced by microplastic fibers in zebrafish. A total of 124 and 123 metabolites were significantly changed by short and long microplastic fibers. At the meanwhile, 41 significantly changed metabolites were shared between short and long fibers treatment groups and were further investigated to reveal the influence of fiber length on the toxicity. The results demonstrate that microplastic fibers can up-regulate glycerophospholipids metabolism which exacerbates oxidative damage and inflammation and down-regulate fatty acyls metabolism related to nutritional deficiency.

However, only few studies report on the identification of microfibers, mainly due to difficulties caused by their small diameter. Here we present the use of Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) microscopy for fast and reliable classification of microfibers from environmental samples. SRS microscopy features high sensitivity and has the potential to be faster than other vibrational microspectroscopy methods. As a proof of principle, we analyzed fibers extracted from the fish gastrointestinal (GIT) tract, deep-sea and coastal sediments, surface seawater and drinking water. Challenges were faced while measuring fibers from the fish GIT, due to the acidic degradation they undergo. However, the main vibrational peaks were still recognizable and sufficient to determine the natural or synthetic origin of the fibers. Notably, our results are in accordance to other recent studies showing that the majority of the analyzed environmental fibers has a natural origin.

All 96 samples were taken and analyzed according to the methodology provided by the US national oceanic and atmospheric administration (NOAA). The combination of observational techniques, FTIR, and SEM analysis was applied to identify MPs. MPs were classified into two categories in terms of size: small MPs and large MPs. The average, maximum, and minimum abundance of MPs (based on dry weight) in sediments of the southern coast of the Caspian Sea was 183.5Â Â±Â 154.4 MP/kg, 542 MP/kg, and 13 MP/kg, respectively. On the basis of morphology, fragment-shaped (30.3%) MPs showed the highest prevalence, while film-shaped (18.7%) MPs were the least contributory. Polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), each of them with a 20% share, were the most common MPs found in the studied samples. The distribution of MPs on the southern coasts of the Caspian Sea revealed a sporadic and irregular spatial pattern. Correspondingly, it can be concluded that probably environmental factors (the current of the sea surface water from west to east), enclosed environment of the Caspian Sea, anthropogenic activities (e.g., industrialization and urbanization, improper waste management, fishing, and tourism activity, residential wastewater), and also discharging of rivers (which can carry plastics) into the sea, have all influenced the abundance and polymer diversity of MPs in the sediments of the southern coast of the sea. More attention should be paid to the health and environmental effects of MPs and to the protection of this sensitive marine ecosystem through implementing proper waste management system by all surrounding littoral countries.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33181919,

Fish were caught prior to settlement and pulse-fed polystyrene microplastics six times over 4 days, then placed in the field on live or dead-degraded coral patches. Exposure to microplastics or dead coral led fish to be bolder, more active and stray further from shelter compared to control fish. Effect sizes indicated that plastic exposure had a greater effect on behaviour than degraded habitat, and we found no evidence of synergistic effects. This pattern was also displayed in their survival in the field.

Our results indicate that juveniles can distinguish MPs as inedible particle and behave differently between MPs with different sizes, colors, and materials, primarily using visual and gustatory senses. Notably, 50%-90% of MP rejection events occurred before capture. Juveniles spent double the time evaluating large nylon particles than they did evaluating large polyvinyl chloride particles before capture, but half the time tasting after capture. Although we observed no sub-lethal or lethal effects of MPs, we conclude that the presence of MPs can still have an impact on groupers in aquaculture.

Using zebrafish, this study investigated the survival and early development of offspring through a 21-day continuous parental treatment with polystyrene microplastics. The results showed that continuous waterborne exposure to high concentrations (>100Â Î¼g/L) of polystyrene microplastics (1Â Î¼m) for 21 days resulted in notable microplastic accumulation in adult fish intestines. Exposure at microplastic concentrations greater than 100Â Î¼g/L also induced significant changes in steroidogenic mRNA expression in zebrafish gonads. However, no significant changes in the cumulative number of eggs spawned and fertilization rate were observed at any parental exposure concentrations when compared to the control. Early development of derived offspring, in terms of hatching rate, body length, malformation rate and mortality rate, did not significantly differ from that of the control. This study showed that transgenerational effects of parental exposure to polystyrene microplastics in zebrafish might be negligible or recoverable. This study provided new results and insights on the transgenerational effects of microplastics on a freshwater fish species and can help to understand impacts of microplastics on freshwater ecosystems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Prole,GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome",33011509,

Results showed that IONPs were mainly accumulated on the zebrafish chorion, and in the digestive system and liver of the larvae. Although the IONPs induced low embryotoxicity compared to iron ions in both exposure conditions, these nanomaterials induced sublethal effects, mainly cardiotoxic effects (reduced heartbeat, blood accumulation in the heart and pericardial edema). The semi-static exposure to both iron forms induced high embryotoxicity compared to static exposure, indicating that the nanotoxicity to early developmental stages of fish depends on the exposure system.

Therefore, in this study, the effects of microplastics on the regenerative capacity of injured fish were investigated using a zebrafish caudal fin regeneration model. After fin amputation at 72Â h post fertilization, the larvae were exposed to polystyrene microplastics (0.1-10Â mg/L) with diameters of 50 or 500Â nm. Microplastic exposure significantly inhibited fin regeneration, both morphologically and functionally. Furthermore, the signaling networks that regulate fin regeneration, as well as reactive oxygen species signaling and the immune response, both of which are essential for tissue repair and regeneration, were altered. Transcriptomic analyses of the regenerating fin confirmed that genes related to fin regeneration were transcriptionally modulated in response to microplastic exposure and that metabolic pathways were also extensively involved. In conclusion, this study demonstrated for the first time that microplastic exposure could disrupt the regenerative capacity of fish and might eventually impair their fitness in the wild.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Gabriel""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""caudal fin amputation --> add behavior on extraction?""]}",32768670,

Fibres, films and fragments are the main categories obtained from the catchment. The microplastics present in the samples were mostly transparent and white coloured which are due to the decay of plastic carry bags, packing materials and fishing lines. Different coloured microplastics were also present in lesser numbers. Polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are the most abundant polymers present in the samples. Fragmentation of larger plastic materials which is due to mismanaged solid waste and garment washing are the primary sources of these materials in the river catchment. Moreover, the sampling sites near to important pilgrim centres like Dharmasthala and Subrahmanya, register higher concentration of fibres released due to washing of clothes. The study concludes that the Netravathi River is contaminated with microplastics from its origin to the sink. However, the spatial distribution and abundance of microplastic particles demonstrate the influence of population distribution, land use and good household practices of waste management in some areas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32758976,

We use light and electron microscopy to evaluate cancer growth and to follow the fate of intravenously injected nanoparticles. FINDINGS: Fluorescently labelled mouse melanoma B16 cells, when injected into this structure proliferated rapidly and stimulated angiogenesis of new vessels. In addition, macrophages, but not neutrophils, selectively accumulated in the tumour region. When injected intravenously, nanoparticles made of Cy5-labelled poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-(diisopropyl amino) ethyl methacrylate) (PEG-PDPA) selectively accumulated in the neural tube cancer region and were seen in individual cancer cells and tumour associated macrophages. Moreover, when doxorubicin was released from PEG-PDPA, in a pH dependant manner, these nanoparticles could strongly reduce toxicity and improve the treatment outcome compared to the free drug in zebrafish xenotransplanted with mouse melanoma B16 or human derived melanoma cells. INTERPRETATION: The zebrafish has the potential of becoming an important intermediate step, before the mouse model, for testing nanomedicines against patient-derived cancer cells. FUNDING: We received funding from the Norwegian research council and the Norwegian cancer society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ?,GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome,2 - Population",32707448,PMC7381511

While MPs have been extensively studied, the toxicity of their smaller counterpart, nanoplastics (NPs), is not well documented. Despite likely large-scale human and animal exposure to NPs, the associated health risks remain unclear, especially during early developmental stages. To address this, we investigated the health impacts of exposures to both 50 and 200Â nm polystyrene NPs in larval zebrafish. From 6 to 120Â h post-fertilization (hpf), developing zebrafish were exposed to a range of fluorescent NPs (10-10,000Â parts per billion). Dose-dependent increases in accumulation were identified in exposed larval fish, potentially coinciding with an altered behavioral response as evidenced through swimming hyperactivity. Notably, exposures did not impact mortality, hatching rate, or deformities; however, transcriptomic analysis suggests neurodegeneration and motor dysfunction at both high and low concentrations. Furthermore, results of this study suggest that NPs can accumulate in the tissues of larval zebrafish, alter their transcriptome, and affect behavior and physiology, potentially decreasing organismal fitness in contaminated ecosystems. The uniquely broad scale of this study during a critical window of development provides crucial multidimensional characterization of NP impacts on human and animal health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Gabriel""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext",32693326,PMC7492438

Poecilia reticulata fry were exposed to MPs for 48â€¯h and, subsequently, offered (as food) to Danio rerio adults for 10â€¯days to simulate an upper level food chain. PE MPs quantification in fry and in different Danio rerio tissues evidenced their accumulation at the two assessed trophic levels. This finding suggested their absorption, adherence and translocation from one organism to another. The accumulation seen in D. rerio directly exposed to MPs was associated with behavioral disorders at upper trophic level. These animals presented behavior suggestive of anti-predatory response deficit when they were confronted with a potential aquatic predator (Geophagus brasiliensis). This finding was inferred through lower school cohesion, shallower school depth and shorter distance from the potential predator. In addition, animals exposed to MPs recorded higher nuclear abnormality rates and changes in the size and shape of erythrocytes and in their nuclei; this outcome has suggested mutagenic and cytotoxic effects, respectively. Based on the current results, MPs are transferred through a food chain that only involves two vertebrates. MPs enter the vertebrates' organs, change their behavior and induce mutagenic and cytotoxic processes in animals, which can cause significant ecological consequences in freshwater ecosystems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Included"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome | USER-NOTES: {""elisa.calcagnotto""=>[""behaviour""]}",32623154,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 9 New Zealand white rabbits unilateral superselective embolization of the lower kidney pole was performed with biodegradable MS made of polydioxanone (PDO) (size range 90-300 and 200-500Â Âµm) impregnated with super-paramagnetic iron oxide (SPIO). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed post-interventionally to assess in vivo visibility. Embolization success was assessed on digital subtraction angiography, MRI and gross pathology. One animal was killed immediately after embolization to assess original particle appearance. 8 animals were randomly assigned to different observation periods (1, 4, 8, 12 and 16Â weeks), after which control angiography and MRI were obtained to determine recanalization. Histopathological analysis was performed to determine biodegradability and biocompatibility by using dedicated quantitative assessment analysis. RESULTS: Ease of injection was moderate. Embolization was technically successful in 7 of 8 animals, one rabbit received non-selective embolization of the whole kidney and abdominal off-target embolization. Arterial occlusion was achieved in all kidneys, infarct areas in macro- and microscopic analysis confirmed embolization success. Control angiograms showed evidence of partial reperfusion. The microspheres showed extensive degradation over the course of time along with increasing inflammatory response and giant cell formation. SPIO-loaded MS were visible on MRI at all time points. CONCLUSIONS: SPIO-impregnated biodegradable PDO-MS achieved effective embolization with in vivo visibility on MRI and increasing biodegradation over time while demonstrating good biocompatibility, i.e., a physiologically immune response without transformation into chronic inflammation.

After exposure to 100 and 1000â€¯Î¼g/L concentrations of MPs (polystyrene; 32-40â€¯Î¼m diameters) for 28â€¯days, we observed that MPs could exist in guppy gut and induce enlargement of goblet cells.

The fragmentation into microplastics (MPs) of plastics such as PVC may facilitate desorption of chemical additives and increase exposure of aquatic animals. In this study, the role of chemical additives in the aqueous toxicity of PVC, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MPs were investigated in early-life stage zebrafish (Danio rerio) by assessment of changes in expression of biomarkers. Exposure of zebrafish larvae to PVC for 24Â h increased expression of metallothionein 2 (mt2), a metal-binding protein, but no changes in expression of biomarkers of estrogenic (vtg1) or organic (cyp1a) contaminants were observed. HDPE and PET caused no changes in expression of any biomarkers. A filtered leachate of the PVC also caused a significant increase in expression of mt2 and indicated that a desorbed metal additive likely elicited the response in zebrafish. Metal release was confirmed by acid-washing the MPs which mitigated the response in mt2. Metal analysis showed Pb leached from PVC into water during exposures; at 500Â mg PVC L(-1) in water, 84.3Â Â±Â 8.7Â Î¼gÂ Pb L(-1) was measured after 24Â h. Exposure to a Pb-salt at this concentration caused a comparable mt2 increase in zebrafish as observed in exposures to PVC. These data indicated that PVC MPs elicited a response in zebrafish but the effect was indirect and mediated through desorption of Pb from PVC into the exposure water. Data also indicated that PVC MPs may act as longer-term environmental reservoirs of Pb for exposure of aquatic animals; the Pb leached from PVC in 24Â h in freshwater equated to 2.52% of total Pb in MPs leachable by the acid-wash. Studies of MPs should consider the potential role of chemical additives in toxicity observed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome",32244159,

Fish were purchased from local sellers in Cairo, and then their gastrointestinal tracts were dissected and examined for MPs. Over 75% of the fish sampled contained MPs in their digestive tract (MP prevalence of 75.9% and 78.6% for Nile tilapia and catfish, respectively). The most abundant MP type was fibers (65%), the next most abundant type was films (26.5%), and the remaining MPs were fragments. Polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) were all non-destructively identified by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A comparison with similar studies from marine and freshwater environments shows that this high level of MP ingestion is rarely found and that fish sampled from the Nile River in Cairo are potentially among the most in danger of consuming MPs worldwide.

For this purpose, we studied (1) live/dead cell assays and identification of cell types, (2) phagocytosis of degradable and non-degradable particles by Atlantic salmon head kidney cells and (3) the effect of incubation temperature on phagocytosis of degradable particles in three aquatic animals-Atlantic salmon, Nile tilapia, and blue mussel. The usefulness of the developed method was assessed by evaluating the effect of incubation temperature on phagocytosis.

Significantly enhanced adsorption capacity of microbeads was observed with up to 5-folds higher than the pristine PE particles. The sorption efficiency was also governed by solution pH, especially for the cosmetic-derived microbeads, indicating the strong adsorption of TBBPA on PE was dominated by both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions.

Diverse polymers were found in marine matrices from the urban site, implying diverse MP sources in highly populated and industrialized areas. Polystyrene was more abundant in the aquafarm site, reflecting the wide use of expanded polystyrene aquaculture buoys. Polypropylene was more abundant at the rural site, probably due to the use of polypropylene ropes and nets in fishing activity.

The results revealed the significant abundance of microplastic particles both in sediments and oysters in all the studied seaports which were estimated to be around 83-350 particles/kg dry weight in the sediments and 0.15-0.83 particles/g wet weight in the oysters. Although, the abundance of microplastics showed similar pattern in the sediments and oysters of the studied seaports, oysters had higher number of microplastics than sediments in all sea ports. Moreover, the results showed that the shapes, size and colours in the oysters did not necessarily match the main components in the sediments, although the polymer types matched well between each other. Black fibres between 0.1mm-0.5mm in size were the most abundant microplastics in oysters, whereas white spherules between 0.5mm-1mm in size were dominant in the sediments of NSW seaports. Moreover, the analysis of variance between microplastic abundance in sediment and oysters showed a non-significant positive linear relationship. Fourier Transform Infrared analysis further indicated that both sediments and oysters contained microplastics with two main polymers, polyethylene terephthalate and nylon, which suggests that the abundance of microplastics in the study ports was highly influenced by the port activities, mainly the intensive commercial fishing and fish processing activities along with intensive anthropogenic and industrial activities inside and surroundings the port environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31756867,

And the amphiphilicity and BBB penetration ability didn't change when Y-CDs were coated with different hydrophilic molecules. Furthermore, Y-CDs were observed to enter cells to inhibit the overexpression of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) which is a major factor responsible for AD pathology. Therefore, data suggest that Y-CDs have a great potential as nontoxic nanocarriers for drug delivery towards the CNS as well as a promising inhibiting agent of AÎ²-related pathology of the AD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",31730144,

Spearman's rank correlation indicated strong and significant correlation between abundance of micro- and meso-plastics for total plastic, film plastic and fragment plastic in shoreline sediment. Significant correlation between macroplastics in shoreline sediment and microplastics in lake sediment for total plastics was observed. The FTIR analysis revealed that polyethylene, polypropylene, Polyethylene Terephthalate, Polyamide (nylon), and polyvinyl chloride were the major polymers.

In this way the pros and cons of an ex vivo approach, using a simplified exposure medium (seawater) and addressing gills histopathology, were explored. The nanotoxic potential of environmentally realistic concentrations of titanium dioxide NPs (TiO(2) NPs) was also assessed, disclosing the morpho-functional effects on the gills and the possible uptake/elimination processes. Excised gills of the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) were directly exposed in artificial seawater to 20 and 200â€¯Î¼gâ€¯L(-1) TiO(2) NPs, for 2â€¯h and 4â€¯h. Semi-quantitative and quantitative histological analyses were applied. The normal morphology of the gill's epithelia was only slightly altered in the control, reflecting protective mechanisms against the artificiality of the experimental conditions, which, together with the absence of differences in the global histopathological index (I(h)), corroborated that the gill's morpho-functional features were not compromised, thereby validating the proposed ex vivo approach. TiO(2) NPs induced moderate severity and dissemination of histopathological lesions. After 2â€¯h, a series of compensatory mechanisms occurred in NP treatments, implying an efficient response of the innate defense system (increasing number of goblet cells) and effective osmoregulatory ability (chloride cells proliferation). After 4â€¯h, gills revealed signs of recovery (normalization of the number of chloride and goblet cells; similar I(h)), highlighting the tissue viability and effective elimination and/or neutralization of NPs. The uptake of the TiO(2) NPs seemed to be favored by the higher particle sizes. Overall, the proposed approach emerged as a high-throughput, reliable, accurate and ethically commendable methodology for nanotoxicity assessment in marine fish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",31639587,

Likewise, we establish that SB203580-loaded in NPs exerts their action during at least a double period than the inhibitor administers directly in both types of inflammation.

Herein, the neurotoxicity of SiNPs of various concentrations (100, 300, 1000â€¯Î¼g/mL) on adult zebrafish was determined by behavioral phenotyping and confirmed by molecular biology techniques such as qPCR. Behavioral phenotype revealed observable effects of SiNPs on disturbing light/dark preference, dampening exploratory behavior, inhibiting memory capability. Furthermore, the relationship between neurotoxic symptom and the transcriptional alteration of autophagy- and parkinsonism-related genes was preliminarily assessed. Importantly, further investigations should be carried out to determine the effects of SiNPs to cause neurodegeneration in the brain as well as to decipher the specific neurotoxic mechanisms. In sum, this work comprehensively evaluated the neurotoxic effect of small-sized SiNPs on overall neurobehavioral profiles and indicated the potential for SiNPs to cause Parkinson's disease, which will provide a solid reference for the research on the neurotoxicity of SiNPs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",31574441,

Engineered carbon nanomaterials can also adsorb pollutants onto their carbon surfaces, and nanomaterial physicochemical properties can influence this contaminant interaction. We used 2D graphene nanoplatelets and isometric carbon black nanoparticles to evaluate the influence of particle morphology and surface properties on adsorption and bioavailability of benzo(a)pyrene, a model aromatic hydrocarbon, to brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) and a fish liver cell line (PLHC-1). Acellular adsorption studies show that while high surface area carbon black (P90) was most effective at a given concentration, 2D graphene nanoplatelets (G550) adsorbed more benzo(a)pyrene than carbon black with comparable surface area (M120). In both biological models, co-exposure to nanomaterials lead to reduced bioavailability, with G550 graphene nanoplatelets cause a greater reduction in bioavailability or response than the M120 carbon black nanoparticles. However, on a mass basis the high surface area P90 carbon black was most effective. The trends in bioavailability and adsorption were consistent across all biological and acellular studies, demonstrating the biological relevance of these results in different models of aquatic organisms. While adsorption is limited by surface area, 2D graphene nanoplatelets adsorb more benzo(a)pyrene than carbon black nanoparticles of similar surface area and charge, demonstrating that both surface area and shape play important roles in the adsorption and bioavailability of benzo(a)pyrene to carbon nanomaterials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",31565225,PMC6764784

Multi-biomarkers, including plasma biochemical parameters and intrinsic immunological factors, were measured after 30 days of exposure. Exposure to Cd or NPs reduced the plasma activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Exposure to both compounds enhanced the observed effects except for AST activity and ALP at the highest concentrations, whereas evidenced an antagonistic interaction in ALT.

Furthermore, early findings also indicated the role of microplastics as vectors of chemical pollutants either used as additives during synthesis of the plastics or adsorbed directly from seawater, i.e., PAHs, PCB, and surfactants. Despite the importance of microplastics in adsorption and transport of hydrophobic pollutants, little is known about their distribution and accumulation in marine food webs, or their direct and indirect harmful effects.

Symptoms and signs have limited value in differential diagnosis of three causes of vaginitis. Current laboratory methods for differential diagnosis are either expensive or time consuming. Therefore, in this work, development of a method based on gold nanoparticles has been investigated for rapid diagnosis of vaginal infections. Specific antibodies against three main causes of vaginal infections were raised in rabbits. The antibodies were then purified and conjugated to gold nanoparticles and used in an agglutination test for detection of vaginal infections. Finally, sensitivity and specificity of this test for diagnosis of vaginal infections were estimated using culture method as gold standard. Purification of antibodies from sera was confirmed by electrophoresis. Construction of nanoparticles was proved by TEM and FT-IR methods. Conjugation of antibodies to gold nanoparticles was confirmed using XPS method. Sensitivity and specificity of gold nanoparticles for diagnosis of Candida species were 100%, for Gardnerella were 100% and 93%, and for T. vaginalis was 53.3% and 100%, respectively.

The initial stages of fishes are highly vulnerable to (a)biotic factors, and anthropogenic pressures, influencing fish larvae assemblages along the estuary. Microplastics (MPsâ€¯<â€¯5â€¯mm) are particularly dangerous to early life stages of fishes because their ingestion can induce gut blockage, limiting food intake or exposing organisms to contamination due to MPs capacity to absorb pollutants. Present work aimed to investigate the contamination of an urban impacted estuary (Douro estuary, NW Portugal) by MPs, and study the abundance and distribution of MPs and fish larvae in this estuary. Monthly sampling surveys were performed from December 2016 to December 2017, in nine stations along the estuary. Sub-surface planktonic horizontal trawls were performed to collect fish larvae and MPs. Planktonic samples were sorted, and fish larvae identified. MPs density was determined using a protocol optimized in our laboratory. A total of 1498 fish larvae belonging to 32 taxa were collected, with a mean density of 11.66 fish larvae 100â€¯m(-3). During the spring-summer period, it was observed the typical increase in the density and diversity of the larval assemblage. Diversity was generally low, with the high dominance of very few taxa, namely the common goby, Pomatoschistus microps. Different types of MPs were found, namely fibers, soft/hard plastic, colorful/transparent plastic, in a total of 2152 particles, with a mean density of 17.06 MPs 100â€¯m(-3). Hard MPs and fibers were the most predominant types, representing 83% of the total MPs collected. In some months the number of MPs surpassed the number of fish larvae, with an average ratio of 1.0 fish larvae:1.5 MPs. Such results are concerning, highlighting that a higher availability of MPs may facilitate their ingestion by fish and therefore increase possible impacts in these communities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31096322,

It is an important first step to understand microplastic uptake in organisms when assessing risk in natural freshwater habitats. We conducted microplastic biomonitoring within the Greater Melbourne Area; where the microplastic baseline pollution in freshwater organisms was largely unknown. A common noxious fish species, Gambusia holbrooki, was targeted. Individuals (nâ€¯=â€¯180) from nine wetlands were analyzed. Uptake pathway, size, weight and gender were examined in relation to microplastic uptake in the body (presumed uptake via gut) and head (presumed uptake via gills). On average, 19.4% of fish had microplastics present in their bodies with an abundance of 0.6 items per individual (items/ind) and 7.2% of fish had microplastics in their heads with an abundance of 0.1 items/ind. Polyester was the dominant plastic type and fibers were the most common shape. The amount of microplastics in Gambusia holbrooki in current study is relatively low in a global comparison. The bodies of fish contained more microplastics on average than heads, and the size of microplastics detected in heads were smaller than those found in bodies. Microplastic uptake was directly proportional to size and weight. Furthermore, female individuals showed a tendency to ingest more microplastics than males. Laboratory experiments under controlled conditions are suggested to further explore such relationships. Our findings are important to understanding the potential ecological risks posed by microplastics to organisms in freshwater environments and provide suitable methodologies to conduct biomonitoring in future investigations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31022621,

The developed analytical protocol for this research requires two main steps: (i) optimized solid phase extraction (SPE) for selective isolation, purification and pre-concentration of target fraction, and (ii) selective temperature-dependent inclusion chromatography for samples analysis via a HPLC-UV-VisDAD system using isocratic elution and internal standard quantification approach. The chromatographic experiment revealed that both Î²-CD and its hydroxypropyl derivative strongly interact with selected bisphenols. This is in contrast to the steroids and PAHs molecules investigated previously, where a strong interaction with Î²-cyclodextrin was observed. Integrated areas derived from acquired chromatographic profiles for each individual sample were used as the simple classification variable enabling samples comparison. We demonstrated that the proposed analytical protocol allows for fast estimation of EDC fractions in various daily use products, food and environmental samples. The materials of interest were selected due to the presence in surface water ecosystems of their residues, and finally, in raw wastewater including rice bags, plastic bags, cloths, sanitary towels, fish baits and various plastic foils from food products. Treated sewage water released directly to the environment from a municipal treatment plant (Jamno, Koszalin) was also investigated. It has been demonstrated that a whole range of low-molecular mass compounds, which may be detected using UV-Vis detector, can easily be emitted from various in daily use products. The presence of micropollutants in treated wastewater, water ecosystems and plastic waste utilization via technological wastewater treatment processes must be addressed, especially in terms of microplastic-based pollutants acting as endocrine disrupters. It is hoped that the proposed simple analytical protocol will be useful for fast sample classification or selection prior to advanced targeted analysis involving the more accurate quantification of specific analytes using e.g., mass spectrometry detectors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30986984,PMC6479962

The results show that this programmed delivery system can release Ag(+) and Sr(2+) in a temporal-spatial manner to clear pathogens and activate preosteoblast differentiation partially through manipulating the polarization of macrophages. Both in vitro and in vivo assays show that AH-Sr-AgNPs-modified surface renders a microenvironment adverse for bacterial survival and favorable for macrophage polarization (M2), which further promotes the differentiation of preosteoblasts. Infected New Zealand rabbit femoral metaphysis defect model is used to confirm the osteogenic property of AH-Sr-AgNPs implants through micro-CT, histological, and histomorphometric analyses.

This novel approach directly separates, identifies, and characterizes MPs from the hyperspectral image (HSI) of the intestinal tract content in combination with a support vector machine classification model, instead of using the real digestion/separation protocols. The procedures of HSI acquisition (1 min) and data analysis (5 min) can be completed within 6 min plus the sample preparation and drying time (30 min) where necessary. This method achieved a promising efficiency (recall >98.80%, precision >96.22%) for identifying five types of MPs (particles >0.2 mm). Moreover, the method was also demonstrated to be effective on field fish from three marine fish species, revealing satisfying detection accuracy (particles >0.2 mm) comparable to Raman analysis.

High specificity IPNV sensor with a detection limit of 2.69 TCID(50)/mL was achieved by conjugating IPNV antibodies to portable Au disk electrode chips using human heavy chain apoferritin (H-AFN) nanoprobes as a binding agent. H-AFN probes were bioengineered through PCR by incorporating pET-28b(+) resulting in 24 subunits of 6 Ã— his-tag and protein-G units on its outer surface to increase the sensitivity of the IPNV detection. The biosensor surface modifications were characterized by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and EIS methods for each modification step. The proposed nanoprobe based sensor showed three-fold enhancement in charge transfer resistance toward IPNV detection in comparison with the traditional linker approach when measured in a group of similar virus molecules. The portable sensor exhibited a linear range of 100-10000 TCID(50)/mL and sensitivity of 5.40 Ã— 10(-4) TCID(50)/mL in real-fish samples.

This situation is likely related to the fact that most studies are focused on the in vitro characterization of these new nanomaterials, and very few provide an exhaustive in vivo characterization, where key aspects, such as pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and, most importantly, toxicity, are properly evaluated. In this work, we propose a protocol for the comprehensive assessment of the toxicity of MNPs, based on the use of zebrafish embryos as an intermediate screening step between cell culture assays and studies in rodents. MNPs with different cores, ferrite and manganese ferrite oxide, and sizes between 3 and 20â€‰nm, were evaluated. Cell viability at a concentration of 50â€‰Î¼g/mL of PEGylated MNPs was above 90 % in all cases. However, the exposure of zebrafish embryos to manganese based MNPs at concentrations above 100 Î¼g/mL showed a low survival rate (<50 %). In contrast, no mortality (survival rate âˆ¼100 %) and normal hatching rate were obtained for the iron oxide MNPs. Based on these results, together with the physicochemical and magnetic properties (r(2)â€‰=â€‰153.6 mM(-1)Â·s(-1)), the PEGylated 20â€‰nm cubic shape iron oxide MNPs were selected and tested in mice, showing very good MRI contrast and, as expected, absence of toxicity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",30763790,

At one day old, birds were divided into 3 groups with 3 replicates for each. The first group received diet supplemented with 100% of their recommended copper requirements as CuO while, in the second and third groups, birds were given diets supplemented with 100% and 50% of the recommended Cu requirements in the form of CuO-NPs, respectively.

Under normal housing temperature, CuO-NPs, significantly enhanced the immune response in these birds, compared to CuO shown by the increased levels of phagocytic activity (PA), lysozyme serum activity, and by upregulating immune-modulator genes including NF-ÎºÎ², PGES, IL-1Î², TGF-1Î², IFN-Î³, BAX and CASP8. The responses were different between the two studied strains especially at the level of gene expression. In HS birds, supplementation of CuO-NPs reduced HS induced inflammatory conditions, as shown by lower gene expression levels, lower degenerative changes in the spleen, and altered heterophils/lymphocytes (H/L) ratio. We suggest CuO-NPs supplementation, especially in those chickens that received diet supplemented with 50% of their recommended Cu requirements, could be used under normal housing temperature to enhance the birds' immune response, and during HS to lower heat stress-induced degenerative changes depending on the magnitude of the HS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",30509642,

(2006) reviewed major pressures on freshwater ecosystems, the biodiversity crisis in the world's lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams and wetlands has deepened. While lakes, reservoirs and rivers cover only 2.3% of the Earth's surface, these ecosystems host at least 9.5% of the Earth's described animal species. Furthermore, using the World Wide Fund for Nature's Living Planet Index, freshwater population declines (83% between 1970 and 2014) continue to outpace contemporaneous declines in marine or terrestrial systems. The Anthropocene has brought multiple new and varied threats that disproportionately impact freshwater systems. We document 12 emerging threats to freshwater biodiversity that are either entirely new since 2006 or have since intensified: (i) changing climates; (ii) e-commerce and invasions; (iii) infectious diseases; (iv) harmful algal blooms; (v) expanding hydropower; (vi) emerging contaminants; (vii) engineered nanomaterials; (viii) microplastic pollution; (ix) light and noise; (x) freshwater salinisation; (xi) declining calcium; and (xii) cumulative stressors. Effects are evidenced for amphibians, fishes, invertebrates, microbes, plants, turtles and waterbirds, with potential for ecosystem-level changes through bottom-up and top-down processes. In our highly uncertain future, the net effects of these threats raise serious concerns for freshwater ecosystems. However, we also highlight opportunities for conservation gains as a result of novel management tools (e.g. environmental flows, environmental DNA) and specific conservation-oriented actions (e.g. dam removal, habitat protection policies, managed relocation of species) that have been met with varying levels of success. Moving forward, we advocate hybrid approaches that manage fresh waters as crucial ecosystems for human life support as well as essential hotspots of biodiversity and ecological function. Efforts to reverse global trends in freshwater degradation now depend on bridging an immense gap between the aspirations of conservation biologists and the accelerating rate of species endangerment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30467930,

We have reported that cell-free chromatin (cfCh) particles that are released from dying cells can integrate into genomes of surrounding healthy cells to induce DNA damage and inflammation. This raised the possibility that RIBE might be induced by cfCh released from irradiated dying cells. When conditioned media from BrdU-labeled irradiated cells were passed through filters of pore size 0.22â€‰Âµm and incubated with unexposed cells, BrdU-labeled cfCh particles could be seen to readily enter their nuclei to activate H2AX, active Caspase-3, NFÎºB, and IL-6. A direct relationship was observed with respect to activation of RIBE biomarkers and radiation dose in the range of 0.1-0â€‰Gy. We confirmed by FISH and cytogenetic analysis that cfCh had stably integrated into chromosomes of bystander cells and had led to extensive chromosomal instability. The above RIBE effects could be abrogated when conditioned media were pre-treated with agents that inactivate cfCh, namely, anti-histone antibody complexed nanoparticles (CNPs), DNase I and a novel DNA degrading agent Resveratrol-copper (R-Cu). Lower hemi-body irradiation with Î³-rays (0.1-50â€‰Gy) led to activation of H2AX, active Caspase-3, NFÎºB, and IL-6 in brain cells in a dose-dependent manner. Activation of these RIBE biomarkers could be abrogated by concurrent treatment with CNPs, DNase I and R-Cu indicating that activation of RIBE was not due to radiation scatter to the brain. RIBE activation was seen even when mini-beam radiation was delivered to the umbilical region of mice wherein radiation scatter to brain was negligible and could be abrogated by cfCh inactivating agents. These results indicate that cfCh released from radiation-induced dying cells are activators of RIBE and that it can be prevented by treatment with appropriate cfCh inactivating agents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",30442925,PMC6238009

Pomadasys ramosus and Haemulopsis corvinaeformis are estuarine dependent species that use habitats with specific environmental conditions each season. Pomadasys ramosus was found in the upper and middle estuaries during the rainy season, when salinity showed the lowest values. Haemulopsis corvinaeformis was found in the lower estuary during the dry season, when salinity increased in the estuary. Juveniles of P.Â ramosus are zooplanktivores, feeding mainly on calanoid copepods. Sub-adults and adults are zoobenthivores, feeding on invertebrates associated to the bottom, mainly Polychaeta. Juveniles of H.Â corvinaeformis were not found in the main channel, but sub-adults and adults showed a zoobenthivore habit, feeding mainly on Anomalocardia flexuosa (Mollusca: Bivalvia). Dietary shifts along the life cycle and the spatio-temporal relationship between their distribution and the availability of microplastics along the estuary seem to have a strong influence in the ingestion of microfilaments. The highest average ingestion of microfilaments by P.Â ramosus coincided with the peak of ingestion of Polychaeta by sub-adults in the upper estuary during the late rainy season. For H.Â corvinaeformis the highest ingestion of microfilaments coincided with the peak of ingestion of A.Â flexuosa by adults in the lower estuary during the late dry season. Such contamination might be attributed to the time when these phases shifted to a more diverse diet and began to forage on benthic invertebrates. Research on microplastic contamination must consider species-specific behaviour, since the intake of microplastics is dependent on patterns of distribution and trophic guild within fish assemblages.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30373032,

However, increasing human activities within estuaries and surrounding areas lead to significant habitat quality degradation for the juveniles. In recent years, plastic pollution has become a global environmental issue as plastic debris are found in all aquatic environments with potential adverse impacts on marine biota. Given the important ecological role of estuaries and implications of microplastics (MP) in ecosystems, here we assess the occurrence, number, size, and polymer types of MP ingested by wild and caged juvenile European flounder (Platichthys flesus). We deployed caged fish for 1Â month at five sites in three estuaries in the eastern English Channel. The Seine estuary, heavily impacted by manmade modifications and one of the most contaminated estuaries in Europe, was compared to two smaller estuaries (Canche and Liane) less impacted by industrial activities. We found that juvenile flounders (7-9Â cm) were vulnerable to plastic ingestion. Seventy-five percent of caged fish and 58% of wild caught fish had the presence of MP items in their digestive tract. Fibers (69%) dominated in the fish's digestive tract at all sites. An average of 2.04â€‰Â±â€‰1.93 MP items were ingested by feral juvenile flounder and 1.67â€‰Â±â€‰1.43 by caged juvenile flounder. For the caged fish, the three sites impacted by wastewater treatment plant (Liane, Le Havre harbor, and Rouen) were those with the highest percentage of individuals that has ingested MP items. Most of the isolated items were fibers and blue in color. Polymers identified by micro Raman spectroscopy were polycaprolactam, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyurethane. Although other environmental factors may have affected caged fish condition and mortality, we found no significant correlation with the number of ingested MP. However, the high occurrence of MP ingested by juvenile fish on nursery grounds raises concerns on their potential negative effects for fish recruitment success and population renewal. Finally, this study describes, for the first time, the feasibility of using caged juvenile fish as an assessing tool of MP contamination in estuarine nursery grounds.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30324374,

This is worrying because NPs can enter the human body owing to their large aspect-to-size ratio and reactive surfaces that facilitate their penetration through biological barriers and thus can induce oxidative stress in host cells. Therefore, there is a growing concern about the toxicity of NPs, which needs to be addressed. Thus, this study investigated the ameliorative effects of Moringa oleifera seed extract (MOSE) in Cyprinus carpio exposed to copper nanoparticles (Cu-NPs). For the in vivo assessment of the shielding effects of MOSE, 240 samples of C. carpio (40-45 g) were randomly allocated to 24 experimental tanks (10 fish/tank of 40 L) 24 h prior to the start of this experiment. The experimental fish were faced with the water-born exposure of a pre-determined dose of 1.5 mg Cu-NPs/l along with pre- and post-treatment with different doses (100 or 200 or 300 mg l(-1)) of MOSE for 28 days. The MOSE showed significant ameliorative effect on the antioxidant defense, in response to the elevated levels of Cu-NP-induced oxidative stress. It also played a protective role as indicated by the suppression of the histological alterations in the gills and liver of fish exposed to the Cu-NPs. It was concluded that the Cu-NP-induced toxicity in C. carpio was ameliorated by the use of MOSE in this study. Moreover, the post-Cu-NP treatment stage showed more protective effects of MOSE than the pre-Cu-NP treatment phase. Further studies are suggested to determine the optimum dose and delivery method of MOSE for similar or different NP exposed fish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",30168446,

EPD was used with different applied voltages and time periods to obtain a uniform layer of nano-zirconia on Ti-6Al-7Nb samples. The coated samples were weighed and the thickness of the product layer was measured. Surface analysis was performed by using optical microscopical examination, scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction phase analysis. For in vivo examination, 48 screw-designed implants (24 uncoated and 24 nano-zirconia coated) were implanted in both tibiae of 12 white New Zealand rabbits and evaluated biomechanically after 4- and 12-week healing intervals. Results revealed that the use of different conditions for EPD affected the final coating film properties. Increasing the applied voltage and coating time period increased the deposited nano-zirconia film thickness and weight. By selecting the appropriate coating conditions, and analyzing scanning electron microscopical examination and XRD patterns, this technique could produce a thin and continuous nano-zirconia layer with a uniform thickness of the Ti-6Al-7Nb samples. Mechanically, the nano-zirconia-coated implants showed a highly statistically significant difference in removal torque values, while histologically these coated implants enhanced and promoted osseointegration after 4 and 12 weeks of healing, compared with the uncoated ones. In conclusion, EPD is an effective technique for providing a high quality nano-zirconia coating film on dental implant surfaces. Moreover, the osseointegration of these coated dental implants is improved compared with that of uncoated ones.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",30074223,

Rapid drug release is first demonstrated from a pH-responsive acetalated dextran particle loaded with dexamethasone (AcDex-DXM), reducing proinflammatory cytokines in vitro as efficiently as free drug. Then, using the air pouch model of gout, mice are pretreated 24 h before inducing inflammation. AcDex-DXM reduces overall cell infiltration with decreased neutrophils, increases monocytes, and diminishes cytokines and chemokines. In a more extended prophylaxis model, murine joints are pretreated eight days before initiating inflammation. After quantifying cell infiltration, only AcDex-DXM reduces the overall joint inflammation, where neither free drug nor a conventional drug-depot achieves adequate anti-inflammatory effects. Here, the superior efficacy of disease-triggered drug-delivery to prevent acute inflammation is demonstrated over free drug and slow-release depots. This approach and results promise exciting treatment opportunities for multiple inflammatory conditions suffering from acute flares.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",30009516,PMC6165597

The ecological implications of macroplastics pollution are well documented, but less is known about nanoplastics. The current study investigates the potential adverse effects of nanoplastics, which likely contribute to the ecological burden of plastic pollution. To this end, we examined whether a dietary exposure of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) to polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) could lead to the transfer of nanoplastics to the offspring, and whether nanoplastics exposure affects zebrafish physiology. Specifically, adult female and male zebrafish (F0 generation) were exposed to PS NPs via diet for one week and bred to produce the F1 generation. Four F1 groups were generated: control (unexposed females and males), maternal (exposed females), paternal (exposed males), and co-parental (exposed males and females). Co-parental PS NP exposure did not significantly affect reproductive success. Assessment of tissues from F0 fish revealed that exposure to PS NPs significantly reduced glutathione reductase activity in brain, muscle, and testes, but did not affect mitochondrial function parameters in heart or gonads. Assessment of F1 embryos and larvae revealed that PS NPs were present in the yolk sac, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and pancreas of the maternally and co-parentally exposed F1 embryos/larvae. Bradycardia was also observed in embryos from maternal and co-parental exposure groups. In addition, the activity of glutathione reductase and the levels of thiols were reduced in F1 embryos/larvae from maternal and/or co-parental exposure groups. Mitochondrial function and locomotor activity were not affected in F1 larvae. This study demonstrates that (i) PS NPs are transferred from mothers to offspring, and (ii) exposure to PS NPs modifies the antioxidant system in adult tissues and F1 larvae. We conclude that PS NPs could bioaccumulate and be passed on to the offspring, but this does not lead to major physiological disturbances.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Gabriel""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Prole,GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext",29940444,PMC7012458

Here we conducted experiments in the laboratory to examine microplastic ingestion (capture and swallowing) and egestion by juveniles of the planktivorous palm ruff, Seriolella violacea (Centrolophidae). As expected, fish captured preferentially black microplastics, similar to food pellets, whereas microplastics of other colours (blue, translucent, and yellow) were mostly co-captured when floating close to food pellets. Microplastics captured without food were almost always spit out, and were only swallowed when they were mixed with food in the fish's mouth. Food probably produced a 'gustatory trap' that impeded the fish to discriminate and reject the microplastics. Most fish (93% of total) egested all the microplastics after 7 days, on average, and 49 days at most, substantially longer than food pellets (<2 days). No acute detrimental effects of microplastics on fish were observable, but potential sublethal effects of microplastics on the fish physiological and behavioural responses still need to be tested.

Most of this is believed to originate on land, although marine activities, such as fishing and shipping, also contribute to the release and redistribution of microplastic. The relative importance of these maritime plastic sources, the manner by which they are distributed in the environment, and their effect on uptake by marine organisms are yet to be fully quantified. In this study, the relative impact of fishing activities on microplastic uptake by demersal fish and crustaceans was explored. Local fishing intensity, proximity to land and mean water velocity are compared to microplastic uptake in plaice, Pleuronectes platessa, and spider crab, Maja squinado, from the Celtic Sea. Observations were also made of microplastic contamination in ingested sand eels, Ammodytes tobianus, to establish a potential route of trophic transfer. This study is the first to identify microplastic contamination in spider crab and to document trophic transfer in the wild. Individuals were sampled from sites of varied fishing intensity in the Celtic Sea, and their stomach contents examined for the presence of microplastic. Contamination was observed in 50% of P.Â platessa, 42.4% of M.Â squinado, and 44.4% of A.Â tobianus. Locations of highest plastic abundance varied between P.Â platessa and M. squinado, indicating that different factors influence the uptake of microplastic in these two taxa. No significant link was observed between fishing effort and microplastic abundance; however, proximity to land was linked to increased abundance in M.Â squinado and Observations of whole prey demonstrate ongoing trophic transfer from A.Â tobianus to P.Â platessa.

Consequently, microplastics commonly defined as sizes less than 5â€¯mm are produced and stay in both seawater and freshwater environment. The presence of microplastics as a new type of emerging contaminant has become a great issue of concerns from public and government authorities. The sources of microplastics to freshwater systems are many with the largest portion from wastewater treatment plants. The abundance of microplastics varies with the location, from above 1 million pieces per cubic meter to less than 1 piece in 100 cubic meters. Microplastics can cause several harmful physical effects on humans and living organisms through such mechanisms as entanglement and ingestion. The microplastics can act as carriers of various toxins such as additives from industrial production processes and persistent contaminants by the sorption in waters. Those toxins may cause great health problems to humans. A few studies on the fishes demonstrated that the microplastics and the associated toxins are bio-accumulated and cause such problems as intestinal damage and change in metabolic profiles. In studies of microplastics, fresh water is first sampled by the nets with typical mesh size of 330â€¯Î¼m for collection of microplastics. After the volume reducing process, the samples will then go through the purification process including density separation by such inorganic salts as sodium chloride and digestion process by oxidizing agents or enzymes. The sequence of these two processes (namely purification and digestion) is dependent on the sample type. The purified samples can be studied by several analytical methods. The commonly used methods for the qualification studies are FTIR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, pyrolysis-GC/MS, and liquid chromatography. A tagging method can be used in the quantification study. Our literature study finds that there is still no universal accepted quantification and qualification tools of microplastics in fresh waters. More work is anticipated so as to obtain accurate information on microplastics in freshwater, which can then be used for the better assessment of the environmental risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",29580559,

Ingested microplastics were classified by type, colour and length with most of the particles consisting of filaments (<5â€¯mm). Longer filaments were more frequently ingested in the upper estuary and smaller filaments in the lower estuary, as a result of differences in hydrodynamic forces and proximity to the probable input sources. The river is likely an important source of filaments to the estuary and filaments ingested in the upper estuary showed little sign of weathering, when compared with those from the lower estuary, which are subject to intense weathering and consequent break-up of particles to smaller sizes. Most filaments, of all colours, accumulated in adults of C.Â acoupa, which are more susceptible to contamination through both direct ingestion and trophic transference as they shift their feeding mode to piscivory. Moreover, the highest ingestion of filaments in adults occurred in the lower estuary, during the late rainy season, likely associated with the intense fishing activities in this habitat, which results in a greater input of filaments from fishing gear, which are mainly blue in colour. Overall, 44% of the ingested filaments were blue, 20% purple, 13% black, 10% red and 12% white. The next most common colour, the purple filaments, are most likely blue filaments whose colour has weathered to purple. Red filaments were proportionally more ingested in the lower estuary, indicating a coastal/oceanic source.

Microplastics alone and mercury alone caused neurotoxicity through acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition, increased lipid oxidation (LPO) in brain and muscle, and changed the activities of the energy-related enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). All the mixtures caused significant inhibition of brain AChE activity (64-76%), and significant increase of LPO levels in brain (2.9-3.4 fold) and muscle (2.2-2.9 fold) but not in a concentration-dependent manner; mixtures containing low and high concentrations of microplastics caused different effects on IDH and LDH activity. Mercury was found to accumulate in the brain and muscle, with bioaccumulation factors of 4-7 and 25-40, respectively. Moreover, in the analysis of mercury concentrations in both tissues, a significant interaction between mercury and microplastics was found. The decay of mercury in the water increased with microplastics concentration, and was higher in the presence of fish than in their absence. Overall, these results indicate that: microplastics influence the bioaccumulation of mercury by D. labrax juveniles; microplastics, mercury and their mixtures (ppb range concentrations) cause neurotoxicity, oxidative stress and damage, and changes in the activities of energy-related enzymes in juveniles of this species; mixtures with the lowest and highest concentrations of their components induced different effects on some biomarkers.

However, NTs are rarely investigated in the clinic due to various issues, such as difficulties in reaching the retina, the very short half-life of NTs, and the need for multiple injections. We demonstrate that NTs can be conjugated to magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), which act as smart drug carriers. This combines the advantages of the self-localization of the drug in the retina and drug protection from fast degradation. We tested the nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor by comparing the neuroprotection of free versus conjugated proteins in a model of RGC loss induced by oxidative stress. Histological data demonstrated that the conjugated proteins totally prevented RGC loss, in sharp contrast to the equivalent dose of free proteins, which had no effect. The overall data suggest that the nanoscale MNP-protein hybrid is an excellent tool in implementing ocular drug delivery strategies for neuroprotection and therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,3 - Intervention",29098325,PMC5843686

The objective of this work was to establish if particulate drug carriers in circulation interfere with normal neutrophil adhesion and migration. Circulating blood neutrophils in vivo were found to be capable of rapidly binding and sequestering injected carboxylate-modified particles of both 2 and 0.5 Î¼m diameter within the bloodstream. These neutrophil-particle associations within the vasculature were found to suppress neutrophil interactions with an inflamed mesentery vascular wall and hindered neutrophil adhesion. Furthermore, in a model of acute lung injury, intravenously administered drug-free particles reduced normal neutrophil accumulation in the airways of C57BL/6 mice between 52% and 60% versus particle-free mice and between 93% and 98% in BALB/c mice. This suppressed neutrophil migration resulted from particle-induced neutrophil diversion to the liver. These data indicate a considerable acute interaction between injected particles and circulating neutrophils that can drive variations in neutrophil function during inflammation and implicate neutrophil involvement in the clearance process of intravenously injected particle therapeutics. Such an understanding will be critical toward both enhancing designs of drug delivery carriers and developing effective therapeutic interventions in diseases where neutrophils have been implicated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",29028303,PMC5709153

The excessive use of antibiotics contributes to this problem as the genes of antibiotic resistance can be transferred between the bacteria in humans, animals and aquatic organisms. Metallic nanoparticles could serve as future substitutes for some conventional antibiotics because of their antimicrobial activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles against major fish pathogens and assess their safety in vitro. Silver nanoparticles were synthesized by chemical reduction and characterized with UV-Vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and zeta sizer. The concentrations of silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles were measured using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Subsequently, silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles were tested for their antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, Edwardsiella ictaluri, Edwardsiella tarda, Francisella noatunensis subsp. orientalis, Yersinia ruckeri and Aphanomyces invadans and the minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined. MTT assay was performed on eel kidney cell line (EK-1) to determine the cell viability after incubation with nanoparticles. The interaction between silver nanoparticles and A. salmonicida was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: The tested nanoparticles exhibited marked antimicrobial activity. Silver nanoparticles inhibited the growth of both A. salmonicida and A. invadans at a concentration of 17Â Âµg/mL. Zinc oxide nanoparticles inhibited the growth of A. salmonicida, Y. ruckeri and A. invadans at concentrations of 15.75, 31.5 and 3.15Â Âµg/mL respectively. Silver nanoparticles showed higher cell viability when compared to zinc oxide nanoparticles in the MTT assay. Transmission electron microscopy showed the attachment of silver nanoparticles to the bacterial membrane and disruption of its integrity. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study on inhibitory effects of silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles towards A. salmonicida and A. invadans. Moreover, zinc oxide nanoparticles inhibited the growth of Y. ruckeri. In low concentrations, silver nanoparticles were less cytotoxic than zinc oxide nanoparticles and represent an alternative antimicrobial compound against A. hydrophila, A. salmonicida and A. invadans.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Title,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",28732514,PMC5521072

Here, we report the engineering of biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA NPs) decorated with triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cations as a robust mitochondrial delivery platform, with the aim of preserving mitochondrial integrity and shutting off the initiation of cell death. Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), a 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) inducer, was used as a therapeutic molecule to attenuate gentamicin (Gen) induced hearing loss. The diameter of the mitochondria-targeting NPs is 145 nm and the encapsulation efficiency is 80.6%. Lysosomal escape and mitochondrial targeting studies indicated the promising therapeutic potential of TPP modified NPs. Finally, the zebrafish lateral line model was applied to verify the efficacy of the GGA loaded targeting NPs for preventing gentamicin-induced death hair cell. The results showed that the prepared targeted NPs provided significant protection: the survival of hair cells increased from 36% to 69% under acute exposure and from 20% to 62% under chronic exposure. In addition, targeted NPs exhibited significantly improved efficiency in alleviating gentamicin-induced hair cell damage compared with free drugs and untargeted NPs, supporting the hypothesis of mitochondrial targeting delivery in the treatment of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. These TPP modified NPs demonstrated promise for the treatment of mitochondrial dysfunction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome,3 - Intervention",28650045,

Predators were the crab Callinectes ornatus and the puffer fish Spheoeroides greeleyi. Transference of microplastics occurred from prey to predators but without evidences of particle persistence in their tissues after 10days of exposure. This suggests a reduced likelihood of trophic cascading of particles and, consequently, a reduced risk of direct impacts of microplastics on higher trophic levels.

Moreover, the development of the embryos after parental exposure was compared with the development of embryos after direct waterborne exposure to the NPs. For this, two experiments were run: 1) embryos from unexposed parents were treated for 5days with Ag NPs (10Î¼gAgL(-1)-10mgAgL(-1)) and development was monitored, and 2) selected breeding zebrafish were exposed for 3weeks to 100ngAgL(-1) (environmentally relevant concentration) or to 10Î¼gAgL(-1) of Ag NPs, fecundity was scored and development of resulting embryos was monitored up to 5days. Waterborne exposure of embryos to Ag NPs resulted in being highly toxic (LC50 at 120h=50Î¼gAgL(-1)), causing 100% mortality during the first 24h of exposure at 0.1mgAgL(-1). Exposure of adults, even at the environmentally relevant silver concentration, caused a significant reduction of fecundity by the second week of treatment and resulting embryos showed a higher prevalence of malformations than control embryos. Exposed adult females presented higher prevalence of vacuolization in the liver.

Attempts to replicate this feat in artificial systems almost invariably result in bubble formation, except under highly controlled conditions with pure water and only hydrophilic surfaces present. In theory, conditions in the xylem should favor bubble nucleation even more: there are millions of conduits with at least some hydrophobic surfaces, and xylem sap is saturated or sometimes supersaturated with atmospheric gas and may contain surface-active molecules that can lower surface tension. So how do plants transport water under negative pressure? Here, we show that angiosperm xylem contains abundant hydrophobic surfaces as well as insoluble lipid surfactants, including phospholipids, and proteins, a composition similar to pulmonary surfactants. Lipid surfactants were found in xylem sap and as nanoparticles under transmission electron microscopy in pores of intervessel pit membranes and deposited on vessel wall surfaces. Nanoparticles observed in xylem sap via nanoparticle-tracking analysis included surfactant-coated nanobubbles when examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Based on their fracture behavior, this technique is able to distinguish between dense-core particles, liquid-filled, bilayer-coated vesicles/liposomes, and gas-filled bubbles. Xylem surfactants showed strong surface activity that reduces surface tension to low values when concentrated as they are in pit membrane pores. We hypothesize that xylem surfactants support water transport under negative pressure as explained by the cohesion-tension theory by coating hydrophobic surfaces and nanobubbles, thereby keeping the latter below the critical size at which bubbles would expand to form embolisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",27927981,PMC5291718

However, the performance of digesting solutions across different temperatures has never been systematically investigated. In the first phase of the present study, we measured the efficiency of different oxidative agents (NaClO or H(2)O(2)), bases (NaOH or KOH), and acids [HCl or HNO(3); concentrated and diluted (5%)] in digesting fish tissues at room temperature (RT, 25Â°C), 40, 50, or 60Â°C. In the second phase, the treatments that were efficient in digesting the biological materials (>95%) were evaluated for their compatibility with eight major plastic polymers (assessed through recovery rate, Raman spectroscopy analysis, and morphological changes). Among the tested solutions, NaClO, NaOH, and diluted acids did not result in a satisfactory digestion efficiency at any of the temperatures. The H(2)O(2) treatment at 50Â°C efficiently digested the biological materials, although it decreased the recovery rate of nylon-6 (NY6) and nylon-66 (NY66) and altered the colour of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fragments. Similarly, concentrated HCl and HNO(3) treatments at RT fully digested the fish tissues, but also fully dissolved NY6 and NY66, and reduced the recovery rate of most or all of the polymers, respectively. Potassium hydroxide solution fully eliminated the biological matrices at all temperatures. However, at 50 and 60Â°C, it degraded PET, reduced the recovery rate of PET and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and changed the colour of NY66. According to our results, treating biological materials with a 10% KOH solution and incubating at 40Â°C was both time and cost-effective, efficient in digesting biological materials, and had no impact on the integrity of the plastic polymers. Furthermore, coupling this treatment with NaI extraction created a promising protocol to isolate MPs from whole fish samples.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",27836345,

Given the limited efficacy of traditional antibiotics, novel strategies may rely on the prevention of such infections through the design of new biomaterials. In this work, two antimicrobial agents applied to nanohydroxyapatite materials-namely, chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles-were compared concerning their ability to avoid single- or dual-species biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The resulting biofilms were quantified by the enumeration of colony-forming units and examined by confocal microscopy using both Live/Dead staining and bacterial-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization. The sessile population arrangement was also observed by scanning electron microscopy. Both biomaterials showed to be effective in impairing bacterial adhesion and proliferation for either single- or dual-species biofilms. Furthermore, a competitive interaction was observed for dual-species biofilms wherein E. coli exhibited higher proliferative capacity than S. aureus, an inverse behavior from the one observed in single-species biofilms. Therefore, either nanoHA-CHX or nanoHA-ZnO surfaces appear as promising alternatives to antibiotics for the prevention of devices-related infections avoiding the critical risk of antibiotic-resistant strains emergence.

Eighty percent of the plastics ranged in size from 150â€‰Î¼m to 1000â€‰Î¼m, smaller than the reported size range of floating microplastics on the sea surface, possibly because the subsurface foraging behavior of the anchovy reflected the different size distribution of plastics between surface waters and subsurface waters. Engraulis spp. are important food for many humans and other organisms around the world. Our observations further confirm that microplastics have infiltrated the marine ecosystem, and that humans may be exposed to them.

However, to date, the models have not incorporated consideration of the role of gut surfactants, or the influence of pH or temperature on desorption, whilst experimental work has shown that these factors can enhance desorption of sorbed contaminants several fold. Here, we modelled the transfer of sorbed organic contaminants dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), phenanthrene (Phe) and bis-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) from microscopic particles of polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyethylene (PE) to a benthic invertebrate, a fish and a seabird using a one-compartment model OMEGA (Optimal Modelling for EcotoxicoloGical Applications) with different conditions of pH, temperature and gut surfactants. Environmental concentrations of contaminants at the bottom and the top of published ranges were considered, in combination with ingestion of either 1 or 5% by weight of plastic. For all organisms, the combined intake from food and water was the main route of exposure for Phe, DEHP and DDT with a negligible input from plastic. For the benthic invertebrate, predictions including the presence of contaminated plastic resulted in very small increases in the internal concentrations of DDT and DEHP, while the net change in the transfer of Phe was negligible. While there may be scenarios in which the presence of plastic makes a more important contribution, our modelling study suggests that ingestion of microplastic does not provide a quantitatively important additional pathway for the transfer of adsorbed chemicals from seawater to biota via the gut.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",27661728,

Here, rabbits with atherosclerosis were treated with carmustine, an antiproliferative agent used in cancer chemotherapy, associated to LDE to investigate the effects on the lesions. METHODS: Twenty-seven male New Zealand rabbits were fed a 1Â % cholesterol diet for 8Â weeks. After 4Â weeks nine animals were treated with intravenous saline solution, nine with intravenous LDE alone, and nine with intravenous LDE-carmustine (4Â mg/kg, weekly for 4Â weeks). RESULTS: LDE-carmustine reduced lesion size by 90Â % compared to the controls. LDE-carmustine reduced the presence of macrophages, vascular smooth muscle cells, and regulatory T cells in the arterial intima, as well as the presence of matrix metallopeptidase-9, interleukin-1Î² and TNF-Î± and lipoprotein receptors, namely LDL-receptor, LDL-related protein-1, scavenger receptor class B member 1. When injected alone, without association to carmustine, LDE was not different from injected saline solution. CONCLUSIONS: LDE-carmustine treatment resulted in marked reduction of lesion area, of the invasion of the arterial intima by macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells and pro-inflammatory factors.

Accumulation in kidney was also dependent on particle size; NPs SS-ZnNPs were trapped more effectively than LS-ZnNPs. No significant accumulation occurred in the brain (pâ€‰>â€‰0.05) while Zn levels in muscle tissue increased only marginally (pâ€‰â‰¥â€‰0.05).

BACKGROUND: HDL is a natural nanoparticle that interacts with atherosclerotic plaque macrophages to facilitate reverse cholesterol transport. HDL-cholesterol concentration in blood is inversely associated with risk of coronary heart disease and remains one of the strongest independent predictors of incident cardiovascular events. METHODS: Discoidal HDL nanoparticles were prepared by reconstitution of its components apolipoprotein A-I (apoÂ A-I)Â and the phospholipid 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. For radiolabeling with zirconium-89 ((89)Zr),Â theÂ chelator deferoxamine B was introduced by conjugation to apo A-I or as a phospholipid-chelator (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-deferoxamine B). Biodistribution and plaque targeting of radiolabeled HDL were studied in established murine, rabbit, and porcine atherosclerosis models by using PET combined withÂ computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging or PET combined with magnetic resonance imaging. ExÂ vivo validation wasÂ conducted by radioactivity counting, autoradiography, and near-infrared fluorescence imaging. Flow cytometric assessment of cellular specificity in different tissues was performed in the murine model. RESULTS: We observed distinct pharmacokinetic profiles for the two (89)Zr-HDL nanoparticles. Both apo A-I- and phospholipid-labeled HDL mainly accumulated in the kidneys, liver, and spleen, with some marked quantitative differences in radioactivity uptake values. Radioactivity concentrations in rabbit atherosclerotic aortas were 3- to 4-fold higher than in control animals at 5 days' post-injection for both (89)Zr-HDL nanoparticles. In the porcine model, increased accumulation of radioactivity was observed in lesions by using inÂ vivo PET imaging. Irrespective of the radiolabel's location, HDL nanoparticles were able to preferentially target plaque macrophages and monocytes. CONCLUSIONS: (89)Zr labeling of HDL allows study of its inÂ vivo behavior by using noninvasive PET imaging, including visualization of its accumulation in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. The different labeling strategies provide insight on the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of HDL's main components (i.e., phospholipids, apo A-I).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",27236528,PMC5589956

Due to its resistance to degradation, most plastic debris will persist in the environment for centuries and may be transported far from its source, including great distances out to sea. Land- and ocean-based sources are the major sources of plastic entering the environment, with domestic, industrial and fishing activities being the most important contributors. Ocean gyres are particular hotspots of plastic waste accumulation. Both macroplastics and microplastics pose a risk to organisms in the natural environment, for example, through ingestion or entanglement in the plastic. Many studies have investigated the potential uptake of hydrophobic contaminants, which can then bioaccumulate in the food chain, from plastic waste by organisms. To address the issue of plastic pollution in the marine environment, governments should first play an active role in addressing the issue of plastic waste by introducing legislation to control the sources of plastic debris and the use of plastic additives. In addition, plastics industries should take responsibility for the end-of-life of their products by introducing plastic recycling or upgrading programmes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",27232963,

RESULTS: The BNF showed larger aggregate diameters when suspended in BNF-lip, compared to clear solution. The BNF-lip formulation produced maximum tumour temperatures with AMF >20â€‰kA/m and showed positive X-ray visibility and substantial shortening of T1 and T2 relaxation time, with sustained intratumoural retention up to 7 days post-injection.

Based on the studied hematological parameters (RBCs count, hemoglobin content and hematocrit%), the two selected concentrations of CuO in their nano- and bulk sizes were found to induce significant decrease in all studied parameters. But, nano-CuO-treated fish showed the maximum decrease in all recorded parameters among the all studied groups especially at the low concentration of 1/20 LC50/96Â h. Hematological status was also confirmed using the calculated blood indices (MCV, MHC and MCHC). In case of bulk CuO-treated groups, the significant decrease in the studied hematological parameters was not followed by any change in MCV and MCH (normocytic anemia), while fish that exposed to NPs showed a significant increase in all calculated blood parameters reflecting erythrocytes swelling which is related to the intracellular osmotic disorders (macrocytic anemia). Regarding metal bioaccumulation factor, the results showed that CuO NPs had more efficiency to internalize fish tissues (liver, kidneys, gills, skin and muscle). The accumulation pattern of Cu metal was ensured by histopathological investigation of liver, kidneys and gills.

Accordingly, strategies against hIAPP aggregation are essential for the prevention and eventual treatment of the disease. Here, it is shown that generation-3 OH-terminated poly(amidoamine) dendrimer, a polymeric nanoparticle, can effectively halt the aggregation of hIAPP and shut down hIAPP toxicity in pancreatic MIN6 and NIT-1 cells as well as in mouse islets. This finding is supported by high-throughput dynamic light scattering experiment and thioflavin T assay, where the rapid evolution of hIAPP nucleation and elongation processes is halted by the addition of the dendrimer up to 8 h. Discrete molecular dynamics simulations further reveal that hIAPP residues bound strongly with the dendrimer near the c-terminal portion of the peptide, where the amyloidogenic sequence (residues 22-29) locates. Furthermore, simulations of hIAPP dimerization reveal that binding with the dendrimer significantly reduces formation of interpeptide contacts and hydrogen bonds, thereby prohibiting peptide self-association and amyloidosis. This study points to a promising nanomedicinal strategy for combating type-2 diabetes and may have broader implications for targeting neurological disorders whose distinct hallmark is also amyloid fibrillation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",26808649,

Encapsulation of drugs in NPs protects them from being metabolized, while they are delivered specifically to a target site, thereby reducing toxicity and other side-effects. However, non-specific tissue accumulation of NPs, for example in macrophages, especially in the spleen and liver is a general problem with many NPs being developed for cancer therapy. To address the problem of non-specific tissue accumulation of NPs we describe the development of the zebrafish embryo as a transparent vertebrate system for characterization of NPs against cancer. We show that injection of human cancer cells results in tumor-like structures, and that subsequently injected fluorescent NPs, either made of polystyrene or liposomes can be imaged in real-time. NP biodistribution and general in vivo properties can be easily monitored in embryos having selective fluorescent labeling of specific tissues. We demonstrate in vitro, by using optical tweezer micromanipulation, microscopy and flow cytometry that polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating of NPs decreases the level of adhesion of NPs to macrophages, and also to cancer cells. In vivo in zebrafish embryos, PEG coating resulted in longer NP circulation times, decreased macrophage uptake, and reduced adhesion to the endothelium. Importantly, liposomes were observed to accumulate passively and selectively in tumor-like structures comprised of human cancer cells. These results show that zebrafish embryo is a powerful system for microscopy-based screening of NPs on the route to preclinical testing.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Included"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""\"" The high affinity of the PSNPs for theendothelium appeared to be associated with toxicity as all theembryos died within 24 h\""""], ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>[""mortality""]}",26648525,

Dengue is a viral disease mainly vectored through the bite of Aedes mosquitoes. Its transmission has recently increased in urban and semi-urban areas of tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, becoming a major international public health concern. There is no specific treatment for dengue. Its prevention and control solely depend on effective vector control measures. Mangrove plants have been used in Indian traditional medicine for a wide array of purposes. In this research, we proposed a method for biosynthesis of antiviral and mosquitocidal silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using the aqueous extract of Bruguiera cylindrica leaves. AgNP were characterized using a variety of biophysical analyses, including UV-visible spectrophotometry, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Bruguiera cilyndrica aqueous extract and green-synthesized AgNP were tested against the primary dengue vector Aedes aegypti. AgNP were the most effective. LC50 values ranged from 8.93Â ppm (larva I) to 30.69Â ppm (pupa). In vitro experiments showed that 30Â Î¼g/ml of AgNP significantly inhibited the production of dengue viral envelope (E) protein in vero cells and downregulated the expression of dengue viral E gene. Concerning nontarget effects, we observed that the predation efficiency of Carassius auratus against A. aegypti was not affected by exposure at sublethal doses of AgNP. Predation in the control was 71.81Â % (larva II) and 50.43Â % (larva III), while in an AgNP-treated environment, predation was boosted to 90.25 and 76.81Â %, respectively. Overall, this study highlights the concrete potential of green-synthesized AgNP in the fight against dengue virus. Furthermore, B. cylindrica-synthesized AgNP can be employed at low doses to reduce larval and pupal population of A. aegypti, without detrimental effects of predation rates of mosquito predators, such as C. auratus.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",26290219,

The multiscale approach involved developing a coarse grained description of the telodendrimer, performing simulations over several microseconds to capture the self-assembly process, followed by reverse mapping of the coarse grained system to atomistic representation for structural analysis. Overcoming the computational bottleneck allowed us to run multiple self-assembly simulations and determine average size, drug-telodendrimer micellar stoichiometry, optimal drug loading capacity, and atomistic details such hydrogen-bonding and solvent accessible area of the nanocarrier.

Microplastics of less than 1 mm can be ingested by small invertebrates, but their fate in the digestive organs and their effects on the animals are yet not well understood. We embedded fluorescent microplastics in artificial agarose-based food and offered the food to marine isopods, Idotea emarginata. The isopods did not distinguish between food with and food without microplastics. Upon ingestion, the microplastics were present in the stomach and in the gut but not in the tubules of the midgut gland which is the principal organ of enzyme-secretion and nutrient resorption. The feces contained the same concentration of microplastics as the food which indicates that no accumulation of microplastics happens during the gut passage. Long-term bioassays of 6 weeks showed no distinct effects of continuous microplastic consumption on mortality, growth, and intermolt duration. I. emarginata are able to prevent intrusion of particles even smaller than 1 Î¼m into the midgut gland which is facilitated by the complex structure of the stomach including a fine filter system.

Furthermore, the low dose exposures of TiO2 NPs significantly activated expressions of C-fos, C-jun, and BDNF genes, and suppressed expressions of p38, NGF, CREB, NR1, NR2ab, and GluR2 genes.

The nanostructures were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), FTIR, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with selected area electron diffraction. The TEM images associated with the UV-vis optical absorption results indicated formation of ultrasmall nanocrystals with average diameters in the range of 2.5-3.0 nm. Also, the PL results demonstrated that the immunoconjugates exhibited ""green"" fluorescent activity under ultraviolet excitation. Moreover, using in vitro laser light scattering immunoassay (LIA), the QDs/immunoconjugates have shown binding affinity against antigen CD20 (aCD20) expressed by lymphocyte-B cancer cells.

Little is known, however, regarding the mechanism of collective movements in microscopic organisms with nervous systems. To attempt to remedy this, we studied collective swimming behavior in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a microorganism with a compact nervous system. We evaluated the contributions of hydrodynamic forces, contact forces, and mechanosensory input to the interactions among individuals. We devised an experiment to examine pair interactions as a function of the distance between the animals and observed that gait synchronization occurred only when the animals were in close proximity, independent of genes required for mechanosensation. Our measurements and simulations indicate that steric hindrance is the dominant factor responsible for motion synchronization in C. elegans, and that hydrodynamic interactions and genotype do not play a significant role.

Nanotechnology provides an effective method to overcome the poor water solubility of lipophilic drugs. Polymeric micelles with small particle size can passively target tumors by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, thus improving their anti-tumor effects. In this study, to improve the water solubility and anti-tumor activity of PL, PL encapsulated polymeric micelles (PL micelles) were prepared by a solid dispersion method. The prepared PL micelles showed a small particle size and high encapsulation efficiency, which could be lyophilized into powder, and the re-dissolved PL micelles are homogenous and stable in water. In addition, a sustained release behavior of PL micelles was observed in vitro. Encapsulation of PL into polymeric micelles could increase the cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and reduce glutathione (GSH) levels in vitro. Encapsulation of PL into polymeric micelles enhanced its inhibitory effect on neovascularization both in vitro and in vivo. Compared with free PL, PL micelles showed a stronger inhibitory effect on the proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Additionally, in a transgenic zebrafish model, embryonic angiogenesis was inhibited by PL micelles. Furthermore, PL micelles were more effective in inhibiting tumor growth and prolonging survival in a subcutaneous CT-26 murine tumor model in vivo. Therefore, our data revealed that the encapsulation of PL into biodegradable polymeric micelles enhanced its anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumor activities both in vitro and in vivo.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",24622772,

BACKGROUND: Middle ear prostheses are often implanted in an infectious environment because of chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma. Bacterial colonization leads to healing disorders after surgery and may lead to the extrusion of the implants. Nanoporous silica layers appear promising as a drug delivery system for antibiotics placed on implants. Before clinical applications can be envisioned, it is necessary to find an optimal release rate. METHODS: White New Zealand rabbits were provided unilaterally with either a ""slow release"" or a ""burst release"" ciprofloxacin-containing middle ear Bioverit II prosthesis. After implantation, the middle ears were infected with a solution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Afterwards, animals were monitored clinically and, after 3 months, sacrificed to perform necropsy and microbiologic examinations. RESULTS: In the ""slow release"" group, 7 of 12 animals had to be euthanized preterm because of their poor clinical condition compared with 2 of 12 animals of the ""burst release"" group (p < 0.05). Clinical and microbiologic examination also showed a better outcome for animals of the burst release group. CONCLUSION: A burst release of ciprofloxacin from middle ear implants is important to combat a perioperative infection with Ps. aeruginosa in the middle ear model of the rabbit.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",23598698,

Exposure of zebrafish embryos to 1.3 nm AuNPs functionalized with a cationic ligand, N,N,N-trimethylammoniumethanethiol (TMAT-AuNPs), resulted in smaller malpigmented eyes. We determined that TMAT-AuNPs caused a significant increase of cell death in the eye, which was correlated with an increase in gene expression of p53 and bax. Expression patterns of key transcription factors regulating eye development (pax6a, pax6b, otx2, and rx1) and pigmentation (sox10) were both repressed in a concentration-dependent manner in embryos exposed to TMAT-AuNPs. Reduced spatial localization of pax6a, rx1, sox10, and mitfa was observed in embryos by whole-mount in situ hybridization. The swimming behavior of embryos exposed to sublethal concentrations of TMAT-AuNPs showed hypoactivity, and embryos exhibited axonal growth inhibition. Overall, these results demonstrated that TMAT-AuNPs disrupt the progression of eye development and pigmentation that continues to behavioral and neuronal damage in the developing zebrafish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",23549158,PMC3663565

A PAMAM dendrimer generation dependent increase in ROS and genotoxicity was observed, consistent with our previous studies. The toxicological responses correlate well with the nanoparticle surface chemistry, specifically, the number of surface amino groups per generation. Although ROS production initially increases approximately linearly, it saturates at higher doses. Notably, normalized to the molar dose of surface amino groups, the dose-dependent ROS production for different generations overlap exactly, indicating that the response is due to these functional units. The genotoxicity response is also well correlated to the number of surface amino groups and therefore generation of PAMAM dendrimers. The observed genotoxicity, related to DNA damage, is related to the generation and dose dependent production of intracellular ROS, at low levels. At the higher ROS levels, increased DNA damage is associated with the onset of necrosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,3 - Intervention",23454648,

Purified AgNPs were well dispersed in water, and stability was maintained during the exposure period. After 14 d of exposure, a significant accumulation of Ag in the AgNP-dosed group was observed in the gill and intestinal tissues, with the highest levels found in the liver. Biochemical analysis indicated a dose-related decrease in the activity of lactate dehydrogenase and antioxidant enzymes in the liver, but not in the gills. However, dose-dependent increases in glutathione depletion and lipid peroxidation in the liver and gills were observed. Exposure to a graded dose of AgNPs also resulted in varying degrees of histological lesions in the tissues. Toxicological endpoints combined with metal distribution analysis suggested that AgNPs induced tissue-specific toxicity and that the liver is the organ most damaged by the Ag that might have been released from NPs.

TiO(2)NPs are taken up into the developing fish, but the egg chorion is a barrier to uptake until the embryos hatch. Chemical probes and a transgenic reporter line confirm photo-dependent production of ROS in vivo, and the addition of an ROS scavenger rescues fish embryos from toxicity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a photo-dependent toxic response in a whole organism from exposure to TiO(2)NPs.

Quantitative comparison of the wall shear stress (WSS) at the first aortic arch (AA1) of wild-type zebrafish embryos during two consecutive developmental stages is presented, using time-resolved confocal micro-particle image velocimetry (Î¼PIV). Analysis showed that there was significant WSS difference between 32 and 48 h post-fertilization (hpf) wild-type embryos, which correlates with normal arch morphogenesis. The vascular distensibility of the arch wall at systole and the acceleration/deceleration rates of time-lapse phase-averaged streamwise blood flow curves were also analyzed. To estimate the influence of a novel intermittent red-blood cell (RBC) loading on the endothelium, a numerical two-phase, volume of fluid (VOF) flow model was further developed with realistic in vivo conditions. These studies showed that near-wall effects and cell clustering increased WSS augmentation at a minimum of 15% when the distance of RBC from arch vessel wall was less than 3 Î¼m or when RBC cell-to-cell distance was less than 3 Î¼m. When compared to a smooth wall, the WSS augmentation increased by a factor of ~1.4 due to the roughness of the wall created by the endothelial cell profile.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of doxorubicin-conjugated single walled carbon nanotubes (CNT-Dox) and doxorubicin-conjugated spherical polyhydroxylated fullerenes or fullerenols (Ful-Dox) on angiogenesis. We report that CNTs exert a pro-angiogenic effect in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, the fullerenols or doxorubicin-conjugated fullerenols exerted a dramatically opposite antiangiogenic activity in zebrafish and murine tumor angiogenesis models. Dissecting the angiogenic phenotype into discrete cellular steps revealed that fullerenols inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, while CNTs attenuated the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin on the endothelial cells. Interestingly, CNT promoted endothelial tubulogenesis, a late step during angiogenesis. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that CNTs, but not fullerenols, induced integrin clustering and activated focal adhesion kinase and downstream phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in endothelial cells, which can explain the distinct angiogenic outcomes. The results of the study highlight the function of physical parameters of nanoparticles in determining their activity in biological settings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ?,GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",20043662,

However, one problem facing the delivery and the monitoring of cell transplants is their noninvasive in vivo visualization. Noninvasive imaging is needed for this. To distinguish transplanted cells from the host liver, it is necessary to either tag these using exogenous contrast agents (eg, iron oxide nanoparticles) or insert a reporter gene that could selectively identify transplanted cells. Nevertheless, these approaches face significant challenges such as providing sufficient signal-to-noise, cellular toxicity, or unequivocal detection. Preclinical studies are currently under way to refine these approaches with initial clinical trials being on the horizon for the next few years.

Within just a few decades since mass production of plastic products commenced in the 1950s, plastic debris has accumulated in terrestrial environments, in the open ocean, on shorelines of even the most remote islands and in the deep sea. Annual clean-up operations, costing millions of pounds sterling, are now organized in many countries and on every continent. Here we document global plastics production and the accumulation of plastic waste. While plastics typically constitute approximately 10 per cent of discarded waste, they represent a much greater proportion of the debris accumulating on shorelines. Mega- and macro-plastics have accumulated in the highest densities in the Northern Hemisphere, adjacent to urban centres, in enclosed seas and at water convergences (fronts). We report lower densities on remote island shores, on the continental shelf seabed and the lowest densities (but still a documented presence) in the deep sea and Southern Ocean. The longevity of plastic is estimated to be hundreds to thousands of years, but is likely to be far longer in deep sea and non-surface polar environments. Plastic debris poses considerable threat by choking and starving wildlife, distributing non-native and potentially harmful organisms, absorbing toxic chemicals and degrading to micro-plastics that may subsequently be ingested. Well-established annual surveys on coasts and at sea have shown that trends in mega- and macro-plastic accumulation rates are no longer uniformly increasing: rather stable, increasing and decreasing trends have all been reported. The average size of plastic particles in the environment seems to be decreasing, and the abundance and global distribution of micro-plastic fragments have increased over the last few decades. However, the environmental consequences of such microscopic debris are still poorly understood.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",19528051,PMC2873009

METHODS: Totally 36 New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into lymphadenitis group and metastatic group. Complete Freund's adjuvant was injected into the bilateral dorsal footpads of 18 rabbits to set up ipsilateral lymphadenitis model. The other 18 rabbits received a subcutaneous implantation of VX2 tumor cell suspension (1.5 x 10(7) cells/ml) in both thighs to set up metastatic lymph node model. Magnetic resonance scan were performed 24 hours before and after USPIO (90 micromol Fe/kg) injection. T2 values of each lymph node were measured and lymph node T2 enhancement rate was calculated as well. HE staining, Prussian blue staining, and electronic microscopy were performed to observe the pathological microstructure changes and the distribution of the iron particle in lymph node. Relationship between lymph nodes USPIO enhancement and its microstructures were further analyzed. Results Thirty-six lymph nodes in lymphadenitis group showed different degrees of reactive hyperplasia. Twenty-six lymph nodes in metastatic group were invaded by tumor cell. Non-enhanced scan showed mild difference between T2 signal intensity of the two pathological lymph node types. After USPIO enhancement, inflammatory lymph nodes showed distinct T2 signal reduction at the center, and metastatic lymph nodes showed homogenous and faint T2 signal reduction. Enhancement rate of benign and malignant lymph nodes were 57.39% and 29.45% respectively (P < 0.01). HE staining and Prussian blue staining indicated USPIO particles located mainly in the macrophages at inflammatory lymphatic medulla, while paracortical area and cortical area contained relatively much less USPIO particles due to less macrophages distribution. MRI findings were correlated with the pathological results. Electronic microscopy also verified that the majority of USPIO particles were located in the numerous cytophagic bubbles of macrophages. Lymph nodes metastasis including 4 lymph nodes with completed structure destruction due to entire tumor infiltration, 19 lymph nodes with partially lymph node structure destruction but reduced USPIO-contained macrophage numbers or reduced USPIO particles in macrophages, and 3 lymph nodes with only localized foci tumor metastasis at subcapsular area. Conclusions USPIO enhancement pattern of different lymph nodes is closely related to distribution and functional status of the intra-node macrophages. It may affect the accuracy of the lymph node property diagnosis based on USPIO enhanced image.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",19507589,

Overall, we found that aqueous suspensions of these QDs were substantially more stable to heat and pH than particles with other surface preparations; we argue that the enhanced stability is due to the uniform, hydrophobic coating of polystyrene around each particle and the reinforcement of this layer by shell-cross-linking. The biocompatibility of these particles was investigated by microinjection of particle suspension into live zebrafish embryos.

The present research examined the interplay of nanoparticle composition and dissolution on response of the zebrafish gill following exposure to toxic (nanocopper or nanosilver) or nontoxic (nano-TiO2) nanometals. Female zebrafish were exposed to 48-h no observable effects concentration of nanocopper and nanosilver or to soluble Cu and Ag that matched the concentration of dissolved metals released during nanoparticle exposure. Both nanocopper and nanosilver exposures increased metal content associated with gill tissue, though silver concentrations were much higher following nanosilver exposures suggesting that intact silver nanoparticles are associated with the gill. Morphological and transcriptional responses of the gills differed among various nanomaterials and between nanoparticulate and soluble species. Nanocopper increased mean gill filament width by three to fourfold between 24 and 48 h, whereas nanosilver did not alter gill filament width at either time point. Global gene expression analysis demonstrates that the exposure to each nanometal or soluble metal produces a distinct gene expression profile at both 24 and 48 h, suggesting that each exposure is producing biological response by a different mechanism. The differences in responses among the exposures indicates that each particle is having a distinct biological effect that does not appear to be driven solely by release of soluble metal ions into the water column. Based on these results, care should be taken when inferring toxicity of nanomaterials from data on a different material.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",19073994,

Two weeks later the rabbits underwent catheterization into the gastroduodenal artery so that, and then the rabbits were randomly divided into four equal groups to receive infusion via the hepatic artery of different drugs: physiological saline (Group A), lipiodol (Group B), adriamycin + lipiodol (Group C), and lipi-nHAP (Group D). Seven and 14 days after the treatment the size of tumor was observed by spiral CT scan, and the volume and growth rate of tumor were calculated. Two weeks after the treatment 8 rabbits from each group were killed and their liver tumors were taken out and the survival rates of remaining rabbits were observed. The necrosis rate of the liver tumor was assessed by measuring the area of the tumor and the necrosis. The apoptotic rate was examined by TUNEL method. Mcrovessel density (MVD) was examined by immunohistochemistry anti-CD31 antibody. Anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) monoclonal antibody was used to detect the expression of PCNA so as to calculate the proliferation index of the cells. RESULTS: The tumor volume and growth rate of Group D 7 and 14 days after treatment were both significantly lower than those of other groups (all P < 0.05) and the necrosis rate and apoptotic index of Group D were both significantly higher than those of other groups (all P < 0.05).

These and similar cell types are being tested clinically, but understanding of delivery and subsequent biodistribution is lacking. This study was designed to quantitatively compare MSC engraftment rates after intravenous (IV), intracoronary (IC), or endocardial (EC) delivery in a porcine myocardial infarction (MI) model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Allogeneic, male MSCs were cultured from porcine bone marrow aspirates. Iridium nanoparticles were added during culturing and internalized by the MSCs. An MI was induced in female swine (27-40 kg in size) by prolonged balloon occlusion of the mid-left anterior descending artery. Animals (n = 6 per group) were randomized to one of three delivery methods. Cellular engraftment was determined 14+/-3 days post-delivery by measuring ex-vivo the iridium nanoparticle concentration in the infarct. Confirmation of cellular engraftment utilized both DiI and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) labelling techniques. During MSC infusion, no adverse events were noted. However, following IC infusion, half of the pigs exhibited decreased blood flow distal to the infusion site. At 14 days, the mean number of engrafted cells within the infarct zone was significantly greater (P< or =0.01) following IC infusion than either EC injection or IV infusion and EC engraftment was greater than IV engraftment (P< or =0.01). There was less systemic delivery to the lungs following [EC vs. IV (P = 0.02), EC vs. IC (P = 0.06)]. Both DiI and FISH labelling demonstrated the presence of engrafted male MSCs within the female infarcted tissue. CONCLUSION: IC and EC injection of MSCs post-MI resulted in increased engraftment within infarcted tissue when compared with IV infusion, and IC was more efficient than EC. However, IC delivery was also associated with a higher incidence of decreased coronary blood flow. EC delivery into acutely infarcted myocardial tissue was safe and well tolerated and was associated with decreased remote organ engraftment with compared with IC and IV deliveries.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",16510464,

The selectivity of the probes was confirmed via indirect labeling with biotin/digoxigenin by nick translation, with detection efficiencies between 50 and 90%. Furthermore, the scFISH probes were successfully detected on metaphase cells with anti-biotin dendrimer conjugates and on interphase cells with 45-base modified dendrimers.

RESULTS: Histopathology of the bone marrow revealed a radiation-induced decline of all hematopoetic cell lines. SPIO were phagocytosed by bone marrow RES cells and caused a significant bone marrow signal decline on postcontrast T2-weighted images (p < 0.05). delta SI(%) data for T2-weighted images were significantly higher for the irradiated bone marrow as compared to non-irradiated controls (p < 0.05).

Upon uptake, micro- and nanoplastics can reach the brain, although there is limited information regarding the number of particles that reaches the brain and the potential neurotoxicity of these small plastic particles. Earlier studies indicated that metal and metal-oxide nanoparticles, such as gold (Au) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles, can also reach the brain to exert a range of neurotoxic effects. Given the similarities between these chemically inert metal(oxide) nanoparticles and plastic particles, this review aims to provide an overview of the reported neurotoxic effects of micro- and nanoplastics in different species and in vitro. The combined data, although fragmentary, indicate that exposure to micro- and nanoplastics can induce oxidative stress, potentially resulting in cellular damage and an increased vulnerability to develop neuronal disorders. Additionally, exposure to micro- and nanoplastics can result in inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity and altered neurotransmitter levels, which both may contribute to the reported behavioral changes.

We investigated the interaction of carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-COOH NPs) with copper (Cu) and algal exudates (EPS) and how such interaction could affect Cu toxicity towards the freshwater microalga Raphidocelis subcapitata. PS-COOH NPs behavior in the presence of Cu and EPS was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS), while PS-COOH NPs surface interaction with Cu ions and EPS was investigated by fluorimetric analysis. ICP-MS was used to test Cu ion adsorption to PS-COOH NPs in the presence and absence of algae. The interaction between PS-COOH NPs and the algal cell wall was assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Short- and long-term toxicity tests were carried out in parallel to assess the impact of PS-COOH NPs on algal growth. Results showed altered nanoparticle surface charge and hydrodynamic diameter following algal EPS exposure, supporting the hypothesis of a protein corona formation. In contrast, no absorption of Cu ions was observed on PS-COOH NPs, either in the presence or absence of algae. No differences on algal growth inhibition were observed between exposure to Cu only, and to Cu in combination with PS-COOH NPs, in short-term as well as long-term tests. However, after 72 h of exposure, the adsorption of PS-COOH NPs to algal cell walls appeared to correspond to morphological alterations, revealing potential disturbances in the mitotic cycle. Our findings confirm the ability of PS-COOH NPs to interact with EPS as shown for other nanomaterials. Environmentally realistic exposure scenarios are thus needed for evaluating nanoplastic toxicity, as nanoparticles will not maintain their pristine nature once released into natural media. Prolonged exposure and use of different end-points such as cell morphological changes and EPS production seem more reliable for the investigation of nanoplastic/algal cell interactions which can drive food chain transfer of nanoplastics and ultimately toxicity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

The polymer pollution problem is so vast; plastics are now observed in some of the Earth's most remote regions such as the Mariana trench. These polymers enter the waterways, migrate, breakdown; albeit slowly, and then interact with the environment and the surrounding biodiversity. It is these biodiversity and ecosystem interactions that are causing the most nervousness, where health researchers have demonstrated that plastics have entered the human food chain, also showing that plastics are damaging organisms, animals, and plants. Many researchers have focused on reviewing the macro and micro-forms of these polymer contaminants, demonstrating a lack of scientific data and also a lack of investigation regarding nano-sized polymers. It is these nano-polymers that have the greatest potential to cause the most harm to our oceans, waterways, and wildlife. This review has been especially ruthless in discussing nano-sized polymers, their ability to interact with organisms, and the potential for these nano-polymers to cause environmental damage in the marine environment. This review details the breakdown of macro-, micro-, and nano-polymer contamination, examining the sources, the interactions, and the fates of all of these polymer sizes in the environment. The main focus of this review is to perform a comprehensive examination of the literature of the interaction of nanoplastics with organisms, soils, and waters; followed by the discussion of toxicological issues. A significant focus of the review is also on current analytical characterisation techniques for nanoplastics, which will enable researchers to develop protocols for nanopolymer analysis and enhance understanding of nanoplastics in the marine environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

This study provides the first report of microplastics and other anthropogenic microparticles in the surface waters and sediments of Lake Simcoe in Ontario, Canada, a popular recreational and fishing lake. Surface waters (low volume grabs and manta trawls) and sediments were sampled from eight sites to determine microparticle abundances and character (size, morphology, material identity). Concentrations ranged from 0 to 0.7 particles/L in surface water grab samples, 0.4-1.3 particles/m(3) in manta trawl samples, and 8.3-1070 particles/kg in sediment samples. Spectroscopic analysis confirmed that 72% of particles were anthropogenic, with 64% unambiguously identified as microplastics. However, confirmed microplastic concentrations were approximately 6-7 times lower than unadjusted counts in sediments, demonstrating the importance of verifying and adjusting reported values. Fibers were only quantified and characterized in surface water grab samples and sediments, and were the most common morphology, accounting for 82% and 89% of anthropogenic particles, respectively. Fragments were most common in manta trawl samples (75%, excluding fibers) and consisted predominantly of polyethylene (41%) and polypropylene (22%). The influence of proximity to urban centers and prevailing winds on the distribution of microplastics was apparent in surface water manta trawls. Microplastics and other anthropogenic microparticles are present in Lake Simcoe but at lower abundances than at locations impacted by larger population centers in other large freshwater lakes such as Lakes Ontario and Erie of the Great Lakes.

We found that toxicity of Ni in combination with either of the two microplastics differed from that of Ni alone. Furthermore, in general, we observed that immobilization of D. magna exposed to Ni combined with PS-COOH was higher than that of D. magna exposed to Ni combined with PS. Collectively, the results of our study indicate that the toxic effects of microplastics and pollutants may vary depending on the specific properties of the pollutant and microplastic functional groups, and further research on the mixture toxicity of various combinations of microplastics and pollutants is warranted.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

To increase the accessibility of methods for characterizing microparticles via Raman spectroscopy, we created an application-based library of Raman spectroscopy parameters specific to microplastics based on color, morphology, and size. We also created two spectral libraries that are representative of microplastics found in environmental samples. Here, we present SLoPP, a spectral library of plastic particles, consisting of 148 reference spectra, including a diversity of polymer types, colors, and morphologies. To account for the effects of aging on microplastics and associated changes to Raman spectra, we present a spectral library of plastic particles aged in the environment (SLoPP-E). SLoPP-E includes 113 spectra, including a diversity of types, colors, and morphologies. The microplastics used to make SLoPP-E include environmental samples obtained across a range of matrices, geographies, and time. Our libraries increase the likelihood of spectral matching for a broad range of microplastics because our libraries include plastics containing a range of additives and pigments that are not generally included in commercial libraries. When used in combination with commercial libraries of over 24 000 spectra, 63% of the top 5 matches across all particles tested (product and environmental) are from SLoPP and SLoPP-E.

More specifically biomarkers for antioxidant response (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, reductase, and glutathione S-transferase), neurotoxic impairment (acetylcholinesterase), lysosomal activity alteration, and genotoxicity have been discussed in detail. Biomarkers are powerful tool in the monitoring programme, but the collection of literature on biomarkers for MPs is limited.

In spite of environmental health concerns, much work has yet to be done on understanding the potential roles of polymer sources, composition and particle sizes in causing adverse effects which have already been observed in a number of biota. The present study was aimed at adding to current knowledge by verifying if, and to what extent, embryogenesis in the sea urchin species Paracentrotus lividus is adversely affected by polystyrene and polymethylmethacrylate virgin microparticles over a size range 1-230 mu m and at concentrations of 0.1-10 mg L-1. Developing embryos which came in contact with the microplastics only after fertilisation did not display a significant increase of developmental defects. Unlike embryo exposures, when P. lividus sperm were exposed to the microplastics or their leachates, modest, yet significant effects were observed, both in terms of decreased fertilisation rate and increase of transmissible damage to offspring. Further, it was noted that larvae more readily ingested polymethylmethacrylate than polystyrene microparticles after 3 days which may represent a route for enhancing the toxicity of the former compared to the latter. Overall, these findings provide evidence for lesser sensitivity of P. lividus early life stages to microplastics compared to other urchins such as Sphaerechinus granularis. In turn, the more robust response of P. lividus highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate test species with the highest sensitivity when investigating mildly harmful materials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

Effects range from no detectable, or very low level, biological effects to more severe outcomes such as (but not limited to) increased mortality rates, altered immune and inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, genetic damage and dysmetabolic changes. A well-established exposure route to MPs and NPs involves ingestion with subsequent incorporation into tissues.

Effects on the proteome, transcriptome and metabolome warrant ad hoc investigations as these integrated & ldquo;omics & rdquo; workflows could provide greater insight into molecular pathways of effect. Given their different physical structures, chemical identity and presumably different modes of action, exposure to different types of MPs and NPs may result in different biological effects in biota, thus comparative investigations of different MPs and NPs are required to ascertain the respective effects. Furthermore, research on MP and NP should also consider their ability to act as vectors for other toxicants, and possible outcomes of exposure may even include effects at the community level, thus requiring investigations in mesocosm models.

However, the role of photodegradation in altering toxicity of MPs to marine organisms is poorly understood. We therefore investigated the photolytic transformation of pristine polystyrene fragments (P-PS) by 60-day ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, and compared the toxicity of P-PS, photodegraded PS (PD-PS), and commercially available polystyrene microbeads (C-PS) to juvenile grouper (Epinephelus moara). Photodegradation reduced the size from similar to 55.9 mu m of P-PS to similar to 38.6 mu m of PD-PS, even produced nanoparticles (similar to 75 nm) with a yield of 7.03 +/- 0.37% (w/w), and induced surface oxidation and formation of persistent free radicals (e.g., CO center dot, COO center dot). Also, endogenous pollutants (chemical additives and polymer fragments) were leached out. Thus, PD-PS had the highest growth inhibition and lipidosis-driven hepatic lesions of grouper, followed by P-PS and C-PS, which was mainly explained by increased hepatic bioaccumulation of MPs/NPs and released endogenous toxicants. Furthermore, oxidative stress-triggered mitochondrial depolarization, suppression of fatty acid oxidation and transport, and promotion of inflammation were identified as the key mechanisms for the enhanced hepatotoxicity after photodegradation. This work provides new insight into the potential hazard and harm of MPs in marine environments after photodegradation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Gabriel""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>["" body weight, no deaths""]}",,

Adverse effects can occur when test organisms are exposed to turbid environments in the presence of various particulate matter (PM), both natural, such as clay and cellulose, and anthropogenic, such as microplastic. It is, therefore, relevant to compare responses to PM exposure between the microplastic and other suspended solids present at ecologically relevant concentrations. This comparison is possible when reference materials are included in the testing of microplastic hazard potential. Here, we evaluated growth inhibition in unicellular alga Raphidocelis subcapitata exposed to different PM (microplastic, kaolin, and cellulose; 10, 100, and 1,000 mg/L); algae without added solids were used as a control. Also, aggregate formation in the exposure systems was analyzed using particle size distribution (PSD) data. At 10-100 mg/L, no adverse growth effects were observed in any treatments; moreover, algal growth was significantly stimulated in kaolin and cellulose treatments compared to the control. However, at 1,000 mg/L, all tested materials exerted growth inhibition, with no significant differences among the materials. Comparing PSD s across the treatments showed that both PM concentration and size of the particle aggregates were significant growth predictors for all materials tested. Therefore, at high concentrations, both natural and anthropogenic materials have a similar capacity to cause growth inhibition. Linking effects in unicellular organisms to microplastic fragments remains a challenge since plastics incorporate chemicals that may leach and elicit specific effects relative to the particulates. The use of reference materials in hazard assessment of plastic litter is needed to delineate these effects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

Recent studies have evaluated the atmosphere as an important pathway of microplastic contamination. Airborne microplastics can be transported long distances and accumulate in various terrestrial and aquatic environmental matrices, where they represent a threat to the biosphere. This review systematically summarizes the existing knowledge on airborne microplastics, including the different sampling and analytical techniques, occurrence and sources. We investigate the different sample collection techniques from street dust to indoor and outdoor air and examined sample preparation, pre-treatment and characterization techniques. We further explored the key factors with respect to their occurrence in the environment such as concentration levels, polymer composition, size distribution, shape and colour characteristics. The sources of airborne microplastics were also summarized. The results show that microplastics are ubiquitous in all atmospheric compartments including street dust and indoor and outdoor air at various concentrations, which is influenced by the community's lifestyle choices, anthropogenic activities and meteorological conditions. Various forms of microplastics including spherules, film, fragments, fibres and granules were identified with fibrous microplastics being the most dominant. Additionally, microplastics of 20 different polymers and varying colour characteristic have been reported in studies focusing on airborne microplastic contamination. The size distribution of microplastics varied among the studied air compartments; however, they were mostly distributed towards the smaller size ranges, less than 1 mm. Our review highlights a need to consider atmospheric pathways in addition to soil and water migration dispersion processes for any holistic assessments of microplastic threats to the biosphere. Moreover, standardization of airborne microplastic sampling methods is needed to optimize the effectiveness of future work in this area.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

However, the majority of experimental studies have employed questionably high dosages of microplastics that have little environmental relevance. Predation, in particular, is a key trophic interaction that structures populations and communities and influences ecosystem functioning, but rarely features in microplastic research. Here, we quantify the effects of low (similar to 65-114 MP/L) and high (similar to 650-1140 MP/L) microplastic concentrations on the feeding behaviour of a ubiquitous and globally representative key marine predator, the shore crab, Carcinus maenas. We used a functional response approach (predator consumption across prey densities) to determine crab consumption rates towards a key marine community prey species, the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, under low and high microplastic concentrations with acute (8h) and chronic (120h) microplastic exposure times. For both the acute and chronic microplastic exposure experiments, proportional prey consumption by crabs did not differ with respect to microplastic concentration, but significantly decreased over increasing prey densities. The crabs thus displayed classical, hyperbolic Type fl functional responses in all experimental groups, characterised by high consumption rates at low prey densities. Crab attack rates, handling times and maximum feeding rates (i.e. functional response curves) were not significantly altered under lower or higher microplastics concentrations, or by acute or chronic microplastic exposures. Here, we show that functional response analyses could be widely employed to ascertain microplastic impacts on consumer-resource interactions. Furthermore, we suggest that future studies should adopt both acute and chronic microplastic exposure regimes, using environmentally-relevant microplastic dosages and types as well as elevated future scenarios of microplastic concentrations.

A variety of freshwater organisms were shown to ingest microplastic particles, while a high potential for adverse effects are expected. However, studies addressing the effect of microplastic in freshwater species are still scarce compared to studies on marine organisms. In order to gain further insights into possible adverse effects of micro plastic particles on freshwater invertebrates and to set the base for further experiments we exposed the mud snail (Potampoyrgus antipodarum) to a large range of common and environmentally relevant non buoyant polymers (polyamide, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride). The impact of these polymers was tested by performing two exposure experiments with irregular shaped microplastic particles with a broad size distribution in a low (30%) and a high micro plastic dose (70%) in the food.        First, possible effects on adult P. antipodarum were assessed by morphological and life-history parameters. Second, the effect of the same mixture on the development of juvenile P. antipodarum until maturity was analyzed.        Adult P. antipodarum showed no morphological changes after the exposure to the microplastic particles, even if supplied in a high dose. Moreover, although P. antipodarum is an established model organism and reacts especially sensitive to endocrine active substances no effects on embryogenesis were detected. Similarly, the juvenile development until maturity was not affected.        Considering, that most studies showing effects on marine and freshwater invertebrates mostly exposed their experimental organisms to very small (<= 20 mu m) polystyrene microbeads, we anticipate that these effects may be highly dependent on the chemical composition of the polymer itself and the size and shape of the particles. Therefore, more studies are necessary to enable the identification of harmful synthetic polymers as some of them may be problematic and should be declared as hazardous whereas others may have relatively moderate or no effects.

However, the interplay between nanoscale materials and biological systems and the associated hazards have not been completely clarified yet. In this study, bovine oviductal epithelial cells (BOECs) and embryos were used as in vitro models to investigate whether cell mitosis and early mammalian embryo development could be affected by the exposure to polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles. Analysis of the karyotype performed on BOECs exposed to PS-NPs did not show chromosomal anomalies compared to the control, although more tetraploid metaphase plates were observed in the former. In vitro fertilization experiments designed to understand whether exposure to PS-NPs could affect pre-implantation development showed that incubation with PS-NPs decreased 8-cell embryo and blastocyst rate in dose-dependent fashion. The quality of the blastocysts in terms of mean cell percent blastomeres with fragmented DNA was the same in exposed blastocysts compared to controls. These results show that the exposure to PS-NPs may impair development. In turn, this may affect the rate of mitosis in embryos and yield a lower developmental competence to reach the blastocyst stage. This suggests that release in the environment and the subsequent accumulation of PS-NPs into living organisms should be carefully monitored to prevent cytotoxic effects that may compromise their reproduction rates.

Samples were then filtered and observed with a stereomicroscope. Fibers accounted for almost all the microplastics collected. An atmospheric fallout between 2 and 355 particles/m(2)/day was highlighted. Registered fluxes were systematically higher at the urban than at the sub-urban site. Chemical characterization allowed to estimate at 29% the proportion of these fibers being all synthetic (made with petrochemicals), or a mixture of natural and synthetic material. Extrapolation using weight and volume estimates of the collected fibers, allowed a rough estimation showing that between 3 and 10 tons of fibers are deposited by atmospheric fallout at the scale of the Parisian agglomeration every year (2500 km(2)).

Here, we measured digested microplastics in a top predator and critically endangered species, the NorthEast Atlantic Porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus), and compared this with general health conditions. A method for quantifying microplastics in spiral valves of porbeagle sharks was developed. Microplastics were detected in all spiral valves, up to 10.4 particles per g wet weight (w.w.) content and 9.5 particles per g w.w. tissue. This equates to individual microplastics loads as high as 3850 particles per spiral valve, most likely a result of trophic transfer. No statistically significant correlations were found between the average number of plastic particles in spiral valve content and tissue and the Condition and Hepatosomatic Index of porbeagle sharks.

Results of numerical simulations indicate the critical properties of the predator-prey system in response to microplastic particles: (i) predators are more vulnerable than prey under exposure to microplastic particles; (ii) the effect of microplastic particles on prey and predator population growths can be negligible when toxicological response intensities of prey and predator are small; (iii) this system is prey dependent for predator functional response, whose stability highly relies on the density of prey; (iv) the reduced feeding capacity of prey and predator induced by microplastic particles does not significantly affect the population dynamics of the predator-prey system.

Additionally, this study established a protocol for sample handling, microplastic isolation (>= 100 mu m) and quantification of gastrointestinal tracts and faecal samples of marine mammals with a low share of contamination. This approach helps to quantify the presence of microplastics in free-ranging marine mammals and is therefore applicable to assess the real burden of microplastic presence in the marine environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

In this study, we analyse the presence of this type of debris in Western Mediterranean striped dolphins' intestinal contents over three decades. Results indicated that frequency was high, as 90.5% of dolphins contained microplastics. Of these microplastics, 73.6% were fibres, 23.87% were fragments and 2.53% were primary pellets. In spite of the high frequency of occurrence, microplastic amount per dolphin was relatively low and highly variable (mean +/- SD = 14.9 +/- 22.3; 95% CI: 9.58-23.4). Through FT-IR spectrometry, we found that polyacrylamide, typically found in synthetic clothes, was the most common plastic polymer.

Limited field evidence from higher trophic level organisms in a variety of habitats suggests that trophic transfer of microplastics may be a common phenomenon and occurs concurrently with direct ingestion. Critical research needs include standardizing methods of field characterization of microplastics, quantifying uptake and depuration rates in organisms at different trophic levels, quantifying the influence that microplastics have on the uptake and/or depuration of environmental contaminants among different trophic levels, and investigating the potential for biomagnification of microplastic-associated chemicals.

Approximately two-thirds of all textile items are now synthetic, dominated by petroleum-based organic polymers such as polyester, polyamide and acrylic. Plastic microfibres (<5 mm) and nanofibres (<100 nm) have been identified in ecosystems in all regions of the globe and have been estimated to comprise up to 35% of primary microplastics in marine environments, a major proportion of microplastics on coastal shorelines and to persist for decades in soils treated with sludge from waste water treatment plants. In this paper we present a critical review of factors affecting the release from fabrics of microfibres, and of the risks for impacts on ecological systems and potentially on human health. This review is used as a basis for exploring the potential to include a metric for microplastic pollution in tools that have been developed to quantify the environmental performance of apparel and home textiles. We conclude that the simple metric of mass or number of microfibres released combined with data on their persistence in the environment, could provide a useful interim mid-point indicator in sustainability assessment tools to support monitoring and mitigation strategies for microplastic pollution. Identified priority research areas include: (1) Standardised analytical methods for textile microfibres and nanofibres; (2) Ecotoxicological studies using environmentally realistic concentrations; (3) Studies tracking the fate of microplastics in complex food webs; and (4) Refined indicators for microfibre impacts in apparel and home textile sustainability assessment tools.

Problems associated with these plastics such as contamination of both marine and freshwater environments and ingestion by aquatic organisms are of increasing concern. Our study quantifies the number of microplastics in a prairie creek immediately downstream of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Water samples and five species of fish were collected from sample sites upstream and downstream of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the summers of 2015 and 2016. Samples were digested in either a Fe(II)/H2O2 or NaClO solution and observed under a microscope where plastics present were enumerated by colour and type. At least one microplastic was detected in 73.5% of fish and 95.6% of water samples, showing that the creek does, in fact, contain microplastics. Concentrations were higher in water from upstream sites, likely due to dilution of creek water by the release of treated effluent. The results of this study provide baseline conditions for the presence of plastics in the creek prior to a major upgrade of the WWTP scheduled for completion in 2016.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Indeed, plastics may detrimentally affect habitats and biota. Small plastics, called microplastics, are more easily taken up by freshwater organisms, causing negative effects on growth, reproduction, predatory performance, etc. Since available information on microplastics in freshwater are fragmentary, the aim of this review is twofold: (i) to show, analyse, and discuss data on the microplastics concentration in freshwater and (ii) to provide the main polymers contaminating freshwater for management planning. A bibliographic search collected 158 studies since 2012, providing the scientific community with one of the largest data sets on microplastics in freshwater. Contamination is reported in all continents except Antarctica, but a lack of information is still present. Lentic waters are generally more contaminated than lotic waters, and waters are less contaminated than sediments, suggested to be sinks. The main contaminating polymers are polypropylene and polyethylene for sediment and water, while polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate are mainly found in biota. Future research is encouraged (1) to achieve a standardised protocol for monitoring, (2) to identify sources and transport routes (including primary or secondary origin), and (3) to investigate trophic transfer, especially from benthic invertebrates.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Although the ubiquitous and persistent nature of MPs in waterbodies is evident, their effects and health implications for aquatic animals are still open to debate. Objective The brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana was exposed to different concentrations (1-1000 particles mL(-1)) of four sizes (1, 3, 6, and 10 mu m) of non-functionalized polystyrene microbeads. To measure MPs effects, several physiological and biochemical parameters such as ingestion and egestion, stress biomarkers [e.g., heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) family, enzymatic activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)], acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and survival rate for 30 days were analyzed. Results Exposure to waterborne MPs showed clear ingestion and egestion in A. franciscana. Exposure to relatively larger sizes of 1000 particles mL(-1) MPs dose-dependently increased mRNA expression of hsp70 families and enzymatic activities of CAT and SOD within 96 h. Significant inhibitory effects on AChE activity were observed in response to 1000 particles mL(-1) with increases in mortality for 30 days. Thirty-day survival of juveniles was dose-dependently affected, with greater effects seen at 1000 particles mL(-1) of MPs. Conclusion Our results suggest that MPs exposure to the early stages of brine shrimp could be detrimental for population maintenance through inhibition of cholinergic system and the induction of acute cell stress, including oxidative stress.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

We chose zebrafish as a model species of which blood plasma is sexually contrasted by the unique presence/absence of the egg yolk precursor protein vitellogenin. Sex-specific protein coronas were thus formed around 70 nm SiO2 nanoparticles using female/male blood plasma from zebrafish or fetal bovine serum as a non-native reference. In contrast to protein coronas formed of male blood plasma, a ""female"" biological identity of the nanoparticles was represented by prevailing contribution of vitellogenins to the corona proteome.

Generally, the AVANI trawl collected a greater numerical abundance and weight of plastic particles in most size classes and debris types than the manta trawl and DiSalvo neuston net, likely because these trawls only skim the surface layer while the AVANI trawl, moving vertically in a random fashion, collects a ""deeper"" sample, capturing the few plastics that float slightly lower in the water column. However, the samples did not differ enough that results were significantly affected, suggesting that studies done with these different trawls are comparable. The advantage of the AVANI trawl over traditional research trawls is that it allows for collection on vessels underway at high speeds and during long transits, allowing for a nearly continuous sampling effort over long distances. As local surface currents make sea surface abundance widely heterogeneous, widely spaced short-tow trawls, such as the manta and DiSalvo trawls, can catch or miss hotspots or meso-scale variability of microplastic accumulations, whereas the AVANI trawl, if utilized for back-to-back tows of intermediate distances (5-10 km), can bridge variable wind conditions and debris concentrations potentially reducing variance and provide a greater resolution of spatial distribution.

The environmental entry areas must be studied to localise their sources and develop preventative and remedial solutions. Rivers are major contributors to the marine microplastics load. Here, we focus on a specific type of plastic microbead (diameter 286-954 pm, predominantly opaque, white beige) that was repeatedly identified in substantial numbers between kilometres 677 and 944 of the Rhine River, one of Europe's main waterways. Specifically, we aimed (i) to confirm the reported abrupt increase in microbead concentrations between the cities of Leverkusen and Duisburg and (ii) to assess the concentration gradient of these particles along this stretch at higher resolution. Furthermore, we set out (iii) to narrow down the putative entry stretch from 81.3 km, as reported in an earlier study, to less than 20 km according to our research design, and (iv) to identify the chemical composition of the particles and possibly reveal their original purpose. Surface water filtration (mesh: 300 mu m, n = 9) at regular intervals along the focal river stretch indicated the concentration of these spherules increased from 0.05 to 8.3 particles m(-3) over 20 km. This spot sampling approach was supported by nine suspended solid samples taken between 2014 and 2017. encompassing the river stretch between Leverkusen and Duisburg. Ninety-five percent of microbeads analysed (202/212) were chemically identified as crosslinked polystyrene-divinylbenzene (PS-DVB, 146/212) or polystyrene (PS. 56/212) via Raman or Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Based on interpretation of polymer composition, surface structure, shape, size and colour, the PS(-DVB) microbeads are likely to be used ion-exchange resins, which are commonly applied in water softening and various industrial purification processes. The reported beads contribute considerably to the surface microplastic load of the Rhine River and their potential riverine entry area was geographically narrowed down. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Smaller plastics are more easily ingested, potentially exerting greater influences on organisms. In this study, the effects of polystyrene nanoplastics (NP) on the toxic effects, bioaccumulation, biodegradation and enantioselectivity of ibuprofen (IBU) in algae Chlorella pyrenoidosa were explored. The influences on the growth rate, chlorophyll a, total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (MDA) were evaluated after 96 h of exposure to a combination of polystryene NP (1 mg L-1) and IBU (5-100 mg L-1). The results indicated that the inhibitory effect of IBU on C. pyrenoidosa growth was alleviated in the presence of NP. For instance, the 96 h-IC50 value for rac-IBU in the treatment lacking NP was 45.7 mg L-1, and the corresponding value in the treatment containing NP was 63.9 mg L-1. The co-exposure of NP led to a significant enhancement of T-AOC and slight reduction of ROS and MDA compared with the individual exposure (IBU) group, suggesting a decreased oxidative stress. In addition, treatment with NP led to a decreased bioaccumulation and accelerated biodegradation of IBU in C. pyrenoidosa and enhanced removal in the medium. The enantioselective toxicity, bioaccumulation and biodegradation of IBU were observed both in the absence and presence of NP. S-IBU exhibited a greater toxicity, and R-IBU was preferentially accumulated and degraded in C. pyrenoidosa. No interconversion of the two enantiomers occurred regardless of the presence of NP. This consequence implied that the influence of coexistent NP should be considered in the environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and personal care products in aquatic environments.

Thus, the goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of fluorescent red polyethylene plastic micro-spheres 1-5 mu m diameter (used as microplastic model and hereafter indicated as MP), alone and in mixture with copper, on the population growth of the marine microalgae Tetraselmis chuff. Two null hypotheses were tested: (H-01) Exposure to MP concentrations in ppb range does not affect the average specific growth rate of T chuii; (H-02) MP do not interact with the toxicity of copper to T. chuii. In laboratory bioassays, T. chuii cultures were exposed for 96 h to MP concentrations ranging from 0.046 to 1.472 mg/1), concentrations of copper alone ranging from 0.02 to 0.64 mg/1, and the same concentrations of copper in the presence of 0.184 mg/I of MP in test media. No significant effects of MP on T. chuii population growth were found (p > 0.05), leading to the acceptance of H01. Copper alone significantly decreased the population growth of T chuii with EC10, EC20 and EC50 of 0.009, 0.023 and 0.139 mg/1, respectively. The corresponding values in the presence of MP were 0.012, 0.029 and 0.145 mg/ 1, respectively. Moreover, the study found no significant differences between the toxicity curves of copper in the presence and absence of MP (p > 0.05), leading to the acceptance of H02. Despite these findings, because microplastics are known to adsorb and accumulate copper, aged pellets more than virgin ones, and the toxicity of smaller particles may be higher, further studies on the combined effects of copper and microplastics on microalgae should be performed, especially under long-term exposures to nano-sized aged microplastics.

It is essential to develop models to predict the sorption capacity of heavy metal ions onto microplastics in global aquatic envi-ronments, and to connect the laboratory study results with the field measurement results. In this paper, the artificial neural networks (ANN) models were established based on literature data. for The results showed that the ANN model could predict the sorption capacity of heavy metal ions (including Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, and Zn) onto microplastics in the global environments with high correlation coefficient (R) values (0.926 similar to 0.994). The predicted sorption capacity was influenced by the initial concentration of heavy metal ions and the salinity in surrounding water. The predicted sorption capacity in rivers and lakes was higher than that in the ocean. Aged microplastics had higher affinity to heavy metal ions than virgin microplastics. The predicted sorption capacity of Cd, Pb, and Zn ions onto large microplastics (5 mm) was less than 0.12 mu g/g. The predicted amount was in agreement with the field measurement results, suggesting that the laboratory studies can provide useful information for projecting the sorption capacity of heavy metal ions onto microplastics in global aquatic environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Consequently, bioaccumulation, and in particular biomagnification of MPs and associated chemical additives, are often inferred to occur in marine food webs. Presented here are the results of a systematic literature review to examine whether current, published findings support the premise that MPs and associated chemical additives bioaccumulate and biomagnify across a general marine food web. First, field and laboratory-derived contamination data on marine species were standardised by sample size from a total of 116 publications. Second, following assignment of each species to one of five main trophic levels, the average uptake of MPs and of associated chemical additives was estimated across all species within each level. These uptake data within and across the five trophic levels were then critically examined for any evidence of bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Findings corroborate previous studies that MP bioaccumulation occurs within each trophic level, while current evidence around bioaccumulation of associated chemical additives is much more ambiguous. In contrast, MP biomagnification across a general marine food web is not supported by current field observations, while results from the few laboratory studies supporting trophic transfer are hampered by using unrealistic exposure conditions. Further, a lack of both field and laboratory data precludes an examination of potential trophic transfer and biomagnification of chemical additives associated with MPs. Combined, these findings indicate that, although bioaccumulation of MPs occurs within trophic levels, no clear sign of MP biomagnificationin situwas observed at the higher trophic levels. Recommendations for future studies to focus on investigating ingestion, retention and depuration rates for MPs and chemical additives under environmentally realistic conditions, and on examining the potential of multi-level trophic transfer for MPs and chemical additives have been made.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: !,GAB: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

A recent addition to the field has been the integration of gold nanoparticles ( AuNPs) to provide enhanced contrast in OCT and PAM images. The improved analysis of capillaries is the result of the strong optical scattering and optical absorption of gold nanoparticles due to surface plasmon resonance. Femtosecond laser ablation created the ultra-pure colloidal gold nanoparticles, which were then capped with polyethylene glycol ( PEG). The AuNPs were administered to thirteen New Zealand rabbits to determine the advantages of this technology, while also investigating the safety and biocompatibility.

In living rabbits, the administered PEG-AuNPs resulted in an 82% increased signal for PAM and a 45% increased signal for OCT in the retinal and choroidal vessels. A histology and biodistribution report determined that the AuNPs had mostly accumulated in the liver and spleen. TUNEL staining and histology established that no cell injury or death in the lung, liver, kidney, spleen, heart, or eyes had occurred up to 1 week after receiving a dose of AuNP.

Factors that influence their ingestion by different fish species are still not well understood. To our knowledge, this is the first work coupling MP accumulation and a full taxonomic description of planktivorous fish diet. We found that MP accumulation was more associated with prey size consumed by fish than with prey type, and species depending on larger mesozooplankton prey accumulated more MP than those dependent on smaller planktonic prey. We identify horse mackerel as a suitable bioindicator for MP monitoring in the pelagic Iberian ecosystem.        Planktivorous pelagic fish are susceptible to accumulating microplastics (MP), which have the same size range as their prey and accumulate in their feeding and spawning grounds. We analyzed stomach contents of pelagic fish (European sardine, horse mackerel, anchovy, chub mackerel, Atlantic mackerel, and bogue) from Atlanto-Iberian waters to investigate the relationship between MP ingestion, their diet composition and select a potential bioindicator. We found significant differences between diet of the studied fish species in terms of prey type and size. MP ingestion was significantly related to diet composition. Species with diets that include smaller prey (European sardine, chub mackerel, and bogue) had lower MP concentration in the stomachs than fish depending on larger mesozooplanktonic prey. Horse mackerel had the highest proportion of larger prey (> 1000 mu m) and the highest MP abundance in the stomachs, and thus are a suitable bioindicator for MP monitoring in the pelagic Iberian ecosystem.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

WWTPs are capable of removing substantial quantities of larger MP particles but are inefficient in removing particles with any one dimension of less than 100 mu m, with influents and effluents tending to have similar quantities of these smaller particles. As a single WWTP may release >100 billion MP particles annually, collectively WWTPs are significant contributors to the problem of MP pollution of global surface waters. Currently, there are no policies or regulations requiring the removal of MPs during wastewater treatment, but as concern about MP pollution grows, the potential for wastewater technologies to capture particles before they reach surface waters has begun to attract attention. There are promising technologies in various stages of development that may improve the removal of MP particles from wastewater. Better incentivization could speed up the research, development and adoption of innovative practices. This paper describes the current state of knowledge regarding MPs, wastewater and relevant policies that could influence the development and deployment of new technologies within WWTPs. We review existing technologies for capturing very small MP particles and examine new developments that may have the potential to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods. The types of collaborations needed to encourage and incentivize innovation within the wastewater sector are also discussed, specifically strong partnerships among scientific and engineering researchers, industry stakeholders, and policy decision makers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Recommendations are provided for methodological standardization, particularly in MP characterization, quality assurance, and quality control (QA/QC) procedures as well as reporting. Considerations for the assessment of MPs in freshwater biota as a means of improving comparisons between studies are discussed. Technological advancements, including the improvement of laboratory infrastructure for identifying MPs within the smaller size range as well as methodological standardization are essential in providing policy makers with tools and measures necessary to determine the distribution of MPs within freshwater ecosystems, while also allowing for comparability and providing compliance for future monitoring requirements.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

SMPs may then block the passage of food through the intestinal tract (i.e. hepatopancreas), accumulate within the organism, and enter the food web. Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) are allochthonous filter-feeding bivalve mollusks, which have been introduced in coastal seas around the world in both natural banks and farms. Considering their economic and ecological value, these bivalves have been chosen as a model to study the ingestion of SMPs.

However, information on different adverse effects of microplastics at nanometer or micrometer scales in human intestine cells is limited. This study compared the cytotoxicity and efflux pump inhibition ability of 0.1 mu m and 5 mu m polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) in the human colon adenocarcinoma Caco-2 cells. Both PS-MP sizes exhibited low toxicity on cell viability, oxidative stress, and membrane integrity and fluidity. However, the mitochondrial membrane potential was disrupted by both sizes of PS-MPs, and the 5 mu m PS-MPs induced higher effects than 0.1 mu m PS-MPs. Furthermore, 0.1 mu m (>20 mu g/mL) or 5 mu m (>80 mu g/mL) PS-MPs inhibited plasma membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter activity and increased arsenic (one substrate of ABC transporter) toxicity. The 0.1 mu m PS-MPs might act as substrates of ABC transporter to reduce the transport capacity of other substrates. However, high concentrations of 5 mu m PS-MPs might reduce ABC transporter activity through induction of mitochondrial depolarization and potential depletion of ATP. This study provides basic information on the toxicity of 0.1 mu m and 5 mu m PS-MPs in human intestine cells, which are useful for assessing the risk of PS-MPs in humans. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

MPPs in the environment can sorb persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that can potentially be assimilated by organisms mistaking MPPs for food. Amphipods (Allorchestes compressa) exposed to MPPs isolated from a commercial facial cleansing soap ingested <= 45 particles per animal and evacuated them within 36 h. Amphipods were exposed to polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs) congeners (BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, -154, and -183) in the presence or absence of MPPs. This study has demonstrated that PBDEs derived from MPPs can be assimilated into the tissue of a marine amphipod. MPPs reduced PBDE uptake compared to controls, but they caused greater proportional uptake of higher-brominated congeners such as BDE-154 and -153 compared to BDE-28 and -47. While MPPs in the environment may lower PBDE uptake compared to unabsorbed free chemicals, our study has demonstrated they can transfer PBDEs into a marine organism. Therefore, MPPs pose a risk of contaminating aquatic food chains with the potential for increasing public exposure through dietary sources. This study has demonstrated that MPPs can act as a vector for the assimilation of POPs into marine organisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

To overcome this problem, nanocomposites were obtained using gelatin as a biopolymer scaffold and silver nanoparticles as a wide spectrum antimicrobial agent. Water and glycerol have been used as solvents for the gelatin hydrogel synthesis. This mixture led to a stable and homogeneous biomaterial with improved mechanical properties.        Methods: Silver nanoparticles were characterized using SEM, EDS and TEM. Moreover, the AgNp/gelatin nanocomposite obtained using these nanoparticles was characterized using SEM and FTIR. Moreover, mechanical and swelling properties were studied.        Results: The storage modulus was 3000 Pa for gelatin hydrogels and reached 5800 Pa for AgNp/gelatin nano-composite. Silver nanoparticles have been studied as an alternative to antibiotics. Importantly, the rate of silver release was modulated as a function of the temperature of the nanocomposite. Thus, the silver release from the nanocomposites at 24 degrees C and 38 degrees C was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The silver release reached 25% after 24 h at 24 degrees C, while a 75% release was achieved at 38 degrees C in the same period, showing the material thermoresponsive behavior. AgNp/gelatin nanocomposite showed a deleterious effect over 99.99% of Pseudoinonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, leading to a material with antimicrobial properties.        Conclusion: AgNp/gelatin nanocomposite with improved mechanical properties and silver nanoparticles as a source of silver ions has been synthesized. The properties of the nanocomposite with controlled silver delivery result in a more efficient topical pharmaceutical form for wound healing applications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",,

OFTs are flexible and versatile optotools based on fibers with one extremity patterned to form a micro-lens. These are able to focus laser beams and exert forces onto microparticles strong enough (piconewtons) to trap and manipulate them.

Results have shown that most of the MPs found in the samples are fragments (57%), followed by pellets (27%), fibres/lines (9%), and then films/sheets (6%). Small particles (<0.5 mm) represented 89% of the total MPs, and this category mainly included fragments (62%) and pellets (30%). MPs were found in a vast variety of shapes and colours, which shows a likely variety of sources. Besides the occurrence of MPs in the stormwater samples, the potential of SDRs as a first sanitary barrier to retain MPs before they reach the ecosystem has been speculated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

In the present investigation, we studied the photocatalytic degradation of diuron in an aquatic ecosystem using lanthanum ion doped nano TiO2 (Lnp) encapsulated in NaY zeolite pores (1 : 10) and impregnated in polystyrene film (ZLT). The hydrophobic nature of the polystyrene support resulted in an efficient and highly recoverable heterogeneous system. Catalyst characterization was carried out by FT-IR, XRD, DRS-UV, fluorescence, BET, SEM-EDAX and XPS. BET results revealed the successful loading of lanthanum ion doped TiO2 (Lnp) inside the NaY zeolite pores via a decrease in surface area for the zeolite encapsulated Lnp (ZLnp) as compared to NaY zeolite alone. DRS UV supported the impregnation of ZLnp in the polystyrene films; the bathochromic shift (Delta lambda) was 4 nm and the hypochromic shift decreased in intensity 10 fold. The photocatalytic reaction was carried out at a concentration of 20 mg L-1 of diuron, with 0.01 M H2O2 and a catalytic amount of 500 mg L-1 ZLT under unstirred conditions. Degradation of diuron by ZLT reached 40% after 2 hours. Noteworthy features are the good results under optimized conditions and that the same film models were used successfully in the presence of zebra fish (Danio rerio). The present investigation also demonstrated successful re-use of the photocatalytic film six times without any appreciable loss in catalytic activity. From the abovementioned results, it was proven that ZLT is an efficient and ecofriendly catalyst.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,MEC: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome,1 - Type of study | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""mortality and body weight, mas faz sentido mantermos? o artigo mostra redução da toxixidade da partículas de zinco na presença de uma cobertura de filme de poliestireno.""]}",,

These MP might have adverse effects at high concentrations and thus efficient extraction and analysis of MP from soil is needed. Here we propose a new method of NaBr solution circulation for extracting soil MP. A device for the circular extraction of soil MP was developed. This device included a separation, vacuum filtration, and solution recovery system. It was then utilized to test separation efficiency of soil MP with three economic and environmentally friendly extraction reagents: NaCl, CaCl2 and NaBr solutions. The separation was tested with ten different types of polymers, three different size classes and three different shapes of MP. Extraction with NaBr showed the highest recovery rates ranging from 85% to 100%. After extraction the samples were treated with H2O2 and analyzed bymicro-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The developed method was assessed for its potential influence on MP and no significant changes in the integrity of multiple MP were found. Finally, the established method was used to analyze MP in four types of soil: farmland, yellow-brown, paddy and floodplain soil from the suburb of Shanghai. Results showed that the mean abundance of MP was 136.6-256.7 item kg(-1). Various MP including PP (40%), PE (35.5%), Acrylic (15.6%), PET (6.7%) and PA (2.2%) were found.

Voluminous studies regarding sources, distribution characterization, and fate of MPs in the different environmental compartments (e.g., marine, freshwater, wastewater, and soil) have been reported since 2004, whereas MPs pollution in unique marine ecosystems (e.g., coastal mangrove habitat) receives little scientific attention. Mangrove ecosystem, an important buffer between the land and the sea, has been identified as a potential sink of MPs caused by both marine and land-based activities. Moreover, the source and distribution characteristics of MPs in this ecosystem are significantly different from other coastal habitats, mainly owing to its unique features of high productivity and biomass. With the impetus to provide a more integrated view of MPs pollution in mangrove habitats, a literature review was conducted based on the existing studies related to this topic. This is the first review to present the current state of MPs pollution in mangrove ecosystems, specially including (i) the possible sources of MPs in mangrove areas and their pathways entering into this habitat; (ii) MPs pollution in the different mangrove compartments (including surface seawater, sediments, and biotas); and (iii) factors influencing MPs distribution in mangrove areas.

In clinical settings, PEGylation is the most relevant strategy to enhance blood circulation, yet it has drawbacks, including hypersensitivity reactions in some patients treated with PEGylated nanoparticles, which fuel the search for alternative strategies. In this work, lipopolysarcosine derivatives (BA-pSar, bisalkyl polysarcosine) with precise chain lengths and low polydispersity indices are synthesized, characterized, and incorporated into the bilayer of preformed liposomes via a post insertion technique. Successful incorporation of BA-pSar can be realized in a clinically relevant liposomal formulation. Furthermore, BA-pSar provides excellent surface charge shielding potential for charged liposomes and renders their surface neutral. Pharmacokinetic investigations in a zebrafish model show enhanced circulation properties and reduction in macrophage recognition, matching the behavior of PEGylated liposomes. Moreover, complement activation, which is a key factor in hypersensitivity reactions caused by PEGylated liposomes, can be reduced by modifying the surface of liposomes with an acetylated BA-pSar derivative. Hence, this study presents an alternative surface modification strategy with similar benefits as the established PEGylation of nanoparticles, but with the potential of reducing its drawbacks.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",,

Previous works have already explored the presence of microplastic (MP) in bottled drinking water as a source of MP intake. Here, we consider the release of MP particles from single-use PET mineral water bottles upon exposure to mechanical stress utilizing SEM plus EDS, which allows the implementation of morphological and elemental analysis of the plastic material surface and quantification of particle concentrations in sample water. The aim of this study was to better evaluate the sources of MP intake from plastic bottles, especially considering the effect of daily use on these bottles such as the abrasion of the plastic material. For that, we analysed MP release of PET bottlenecks and HDPE caps on their surfaces after a series of bottle openings/closings (1 x, 10 x, 100 x). Furthermore, we investigated, if the inner surface of the PET bottles released MPs, counted particle increase of the water and identified MPs in the PET bottled water after exposing the bottles to mechanical stress (squeezing treatment; none, 1 min, 10 min). The results showed a considerable increase of MP particle occurrence on the surface of PET and HDPE material (bottlenecks and caps) after opening and closing the bottles. After 100 times the effect was impressive, especially on caps. Moreover, great differences exist in cap abrasion between brands which uncovers a discrepancy in plastic behavior of brands. Interestingly, particle concentrations in the bottled mineral water did not significantly increase after exposure to mechanical stress (squeezing treatment). The morphological analysis of the inner wall surface of the bottles supported this observation, as no stress cracks could be detected after the treatment, implying that the bottles itself are not a consistent source of MP particles after this extent of mechanical stress. However, chances of MP ingestion by humans increase with frequent use of the same single-use plastic bottle, though only from the bottleneck-cap system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Potential routes of environmental exposure include manufacturing or transport spills, disposal of NP-containing products down the drain and/or in landfills, as well as direct usage on agricultural land. Therefore, NPs will inevitably contaminate aquatic environments and interact with resident organisms. However, there is limited information regarding the mechanisms that regulate NP transport into fish from the environment. Thus, our primary objective was to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying cellular uptake and intracellular fate of 3-9 nm poly (acrylic acid) NPs loaded with the fluorescent dye Nile red using a rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) gill epithelial cell line (RTgill-W1). In vitro measurements with NP-treated RTgill-W1 cells were carried out using a combination of laser scanning confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, fluorescent biomarkers (transferrin, cholera toxin B subunit, and dextran), endocytosis inhibitors (chlorpromazine, genistein, and wortmannin), and stains (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Hoechst 33342, CellMask Deep Red, and LysoTracker Yellow). Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), caveolae-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis pathways were active in RTgill-W1 cells, and these pathways were exploited by the non-cytotoxic NPs to enter these cells. We have demonstrated that NP uptake by RTgill-W1 cells was impeded when clathrin-coated pit formation was blocked by chlorpromazine. Furthermore, colocalization analysis revealed a moderate positive relationship between NPs and LysoTracker Yellow-positive lysosomal compartments indicating that CME was the dominant operative mechanism involved in NP internalization by RTgill-W1 cells. Overall, our results clearly show that fish gill epithelial cells internalized NPs via energy-dependent endocytotic processes. This study enhances our understanding of complex NP-cell interactions and the results obtained in vitro imply a potential risk to aquatic organisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

To improve their biocompatibility, polyethylene glycol-modified CDs (PEG-CDs) were prepared. In this study we compared the cardiac toxicity of CDs and PEG-CDs in mouse and zebrafish models.        Methods: Mice were intravenously treated with CDs (size: 4.9 nm, 5 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) or PEG-CDs (size: 8.3 nm, 5 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) for 21 d. Their blood biochemistry indices, ECG, and histological examination were examined for evaluation of cardiac toxicity. CDs or PEG-CDs was added in incubator of cmlc2 transgenic Zebrafish embryos at 6 hpf, and the shape and size of embryos' hearts were observed at 48 hpf using a fluorescent microscope. Furthermore, whole-mount in situ hybridization was used to examine the expression of early cardiac marker gene (clml2) at 48 hpf.        Results: Administration of CDs or PEG-CDs in mice caused mild, but statistically insignificant reduction in serum creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels detected at 7 d, which were returned to the respective control levels at 21 d. Neither CDs nor PEG-CDs caused significant changes in the morphology of heart cells. Administration of CDs, but not PEG-CDs, in mice caused marked increase of heart rate. Both CDs and PEG-CDs did not affect other ECG parameters. In the zebrafish embryos, addition of CDs (20 mu g/mL) caused heart development delay, whereas addition of CDs (80 mu g/mL) led to heart malformation. In contrast, PEG-CDs caused considerably small changes in heart development, which was consistent with the results from the in situ hybridization experiments.        Conclusion: CDs causes greater cardiac toxicity, especially regarding heart development. Polyethylene glycol modification can attenuate the cardiac toxicity of CDs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",,

MPs have, therefore, frequently been discussed as vectors for contaminants, enhancing HOC uptake by various organisms after ingestion followed by pollutant release; however, integrative models of sorption argue against this mechanism and even predict cleansing of pollutants from biological systems under particular circumstances. In order to experimentally investigate such a depuration mechanism, RTL-W1 cells were dosed with three 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) inducers of distinct lipophilicity via the medium before adding both native and hexane-purified polyethylene MPs (20-25 mu m) to the medium surface. EROD activity was significantly reduced in the presence of MP, the extent of which correlated with the inducers' lipophilicity (K-OW) and thus affinity to MP. For hexane-purged MPs and TCDD (K-OW = 6.8), MPs reduce the bioavailability by up to 79%; the effect was marginally weaker with benzo[k]fluoranthene (K-OW = 6.11) and almost absent with beta-Naphthoflavone (K-OW = 4.68). Compared to hexane-purged MPs, native particles possessed slightly less detoxification potential. These experimental results corroborate theoretically predicted mechanisms of detoxification via MPs. Yet, it is unclear if, under corresponding conditions in the environment, MPs can compete with organismal tissues for highly lipophilic compounds and, if so, to which degree they may act as a sink reducing the amount of bioavailable pollutants in situ. However, the present results suggest that in scenarios where pollutant-free MPs interact with organisms that accumulated HOCs via other routes of uptake, qualitatively the presence of such a mechanism is likely.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

This reduction in ecosystem service provision is evidenced to have implications for human health and wellbeing, linked particularly to fisheries, heritage and charismatic species, and recreation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

These particles can serve as vectors of chemical toxins and microbial pathogens and thus, as organisms consume them, may lead to biomagnification of these contaminants. As collection points in managed water systems, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) provide an opportunity to develop and implement novel technologies to manage SAL pollution. Here, we assessed the efficiency of different unit processes at three WWTPs in removing SAL. Samples were collected from WWTPs that employ either secondary treatment (activated sludge) or tertiary treatment (granular sand filtration) as a final step, as well as a pilot membrane bioreactor system that finishes treatment with microfiltration. SAL from 20 mu m to 4.75mm was quantified and categorized by shape. The WWTP with secondary treatment removed 95.6% of SAL, discharging 5.9 SAL per L in the final effluent; the plant with tertiary treatment removed 97.2% of SAL, discharging 2.6 SAL per L; the membrane bioreactor plant removed 99.4% of SAL, discharging 0.5 SAL per L. The majority of SAL in effluent from all plants was comprised of thin fibers (e.g., textile fibers). While the WWTP with tertiary granular sand filtration and the membrane bioreactor exhibited greater overall removal of SAL, fibers represented a larger percentage of SAL in effluent from these plants (79 and 83%, respectively) than the plant with activated sludge as a final step (44% fibers). This study suggests that retrofitting existing secondary WWTPs with granular sand filtration or membrane filtration would result in the highest possible removal of SAL-though treatment facilities would continue to serve as pathways of SAL pollution to the environment. Further, the fate of the 95-99% of SAL that is retained or leaves WWTPs through means other than effluent (e.g., sludge) must be resolved to effectively address this problem.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Here, we demonstrate the use of a thermoresponsive RAFT macro chain transfer agent (MacroCTA) to form seed particles for the chain extension of styrene to form block copolymer latex particles. By incorporating a few styrene units into the MacroCTA, the polymerizations become faster, producing both narrow particle size and molecular weight distributions. This is due to the 'superswelling effect', in which all the seed particles swell with monomer and nucleated at the same time. The resulting latex particles could then be transformed into a variety of nanostructures by cooling below the lower critical solution temperature of the thermoresponsive block in the presence of a plasticizer for polystyrene. The dominant structure was cylindrical worms with the observation of other structures including jelly fish and the rare disc. Cooling under ultrasound produced either vesicles or cauliflower structures. The work demonstrated that utilizing the 'superswelling effect', control over the rate, and molecular weight and particle size distributions could be obtained, providing design parameters to construct new nanostructures.

On the basis of the classic nucleation theory and hydrodynamics simulation, the nanoscale structure can intensify the interfacial nanoscale turbulent flow and hinder the crystal deposition, which works like the fish gill. In addition, the optimized nanoscale feature size renders the membrane with the heterogeneous nucleation barrier very similar to the homogeneous system, which works like the lotus leaf and hinders the induced nucleation effectively. The microscale structure as the supporting platform of nanostructure can additionally enlarge the effective evaporative surface with superior hydrophobicity and then promote the permeation transfer through the membrane. The hybrid micro/nanostructures render the fabricated membrane with excellent high-permeation flux and significantly prolonged fouling induction time, which sheds light on a new approach for the development of ideal MD utilized membrane.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

This versatile endpoint can be used to screen for effects of chemical exposures, determine no effect concentrations, provide clues to modes/mechanisms of action, evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacologic therapies and environmental remediation efforts, and assess the background health of test subjects. Unfortunately, recent reviews of the literature suggest that the credibility of histopathology findings in peer-reviewed journal articles is often less than desirable, and there is evidence that this situation may be worsening. Key weaknesses include inadequate experimental design, inferior histologic preparation, inaccurate diagnostic interpretation, inexpert manuscript creation, and ineffectual manuscript review. On the brighter side, it is evident that there are multiple stages in the research and reporting process where innovations may be instituted to improve the quality of published histopathology results.

The TTF-nanodots were microinjected into zebrafish embryos, and the different growth stages of the labeled embryos were monitored with a three-photon fluorescence microscope. TTF-nanodots could be traced inside the zebrafish body for as long as 120 hours. In addition, the TTF-nanodots were utilized to target the blood vessel of zebrafish, and three-photon fluorescence angiogram was performed. More importantly, these nanodots were highly resistant to photobleaching under 1,560 nm-fs excitation, allowing long-term imaging of zebrafish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention,1 - Type of study",,

Whole body trypsin and chymotrypsin activities increased significantly in fish exposed to 0.5 and 1.0 mg/L PVC as compared those exposed to zero or 0.2 mg/L PVC. In fish exposed to all tested concentrations, PVCs were observed in both the proximal and distal intestine, and fish exposed to 0.5-1.0 and 1.0 mg/L PVC, respectively, and these particles were associated with localized thickening of the mucosal epithelium. No tissue damage was evident in any other internal organs or gills. This lack of damage may be attributed to the absence of contaminants associated with the PVC fragments and their relatively smooth surface. The increased whole body trypsin and chymotrypsin activities may indicate an attempt to enhance digestion to compensate for epithelial thickening of the intestine and/or to digest the plastics.

Herein, novel poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers, which were incorporated with a self-assembled graphene oxide (GO)-coated gamma-Al2O3 composite (Al2O3@GO), were fabricated on stainless steel wires via an electrospinning method. The as-spun nanofibers were further sheathed through the self-polymerization of noradrenaline (NA), an agonist found in oysters, to provide a compatible biointerface and antifouling capacity. Acting as the coating substrate of the as-prepared fibers, PLGA is known for its prominent biocompatibility and biodegradability, while the adsorptive Al2O3@GO particles helped to increase their loading capacity. The modified PLGA-based electrospun nanofibers exhibited much higher extraction efficiency compared with the thicker polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coatings (165 mm) and polyacrylate (PA) coatings (85 mm). Due to the fine biointerface of the PLGA-based nanofibers, a rapid extraction equilibrium was observed and sampling with the custom-made Al2O3@GO-PLGA@PNA fibers could be accomplished within 15 min. The fibers were then successfully employed for simultaneous in vivo sampling of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and sulfonamides (SAs) in the dorsal-epaxial muscle of living pufferfish (Takifugu obscurus), and satisfactory sensitivities with limits of detection (LODs) in the range of 0.52-2.30 ng g(-1) and comparable accuracies to the conventional liquid extraction (LE) method were achieved. In vivo sampling of target pharmaceuticals with the modified nanofibers showed their feasibility for further metabolomics and pharmacokinetics studies in biotissues.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The currently practiced methods for cancer therapy have many defects, such as side effects, low curate rate, and discomfort for patients.        Objective: Herein, we summarize the applications of gold nanorods (AuNRs) in cancer therapy based on their photothermal effect-the conversion of light into local heat under irradiation.        Methods: The recent advances in the synthesis and regulation of AuNRs, and facile surface functionalization further facilitate their use in cancer treatment. For cancer therapy, AuNRs need to be modified or coated with biocompatible molecules (e.g. polyethylene glycol) and materials (e.g. silicon) to reduce the cytotoxicity and increase their biocompatibility, stability, and retention time in the bloodstream. The accumulation of AuNRs in cancerous cells and tissues is due to the high leakage in tumors or the specific interaction between the cell surface and functional molecules on AuNRs such as antibodies, aptamers, and receptors.        Results: AuNRs are employed not only as therapeutics to ablate tumors solely based on the heat produced under laser that could denature protein and activate the apoptotic pathway, but also as synergistic therapies combined with photodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, and gene therapy to kill cancer more efficiently. More importantly, other materials like TiO2, graphene oxide, and silicon, etc. are incorporated on the AuNR surface for multimodal cancer treatment with high drug loadings and improved cancer-killing efficiency. To highlight their applications in cancer treatment, examples of therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo are presented.        Conclusion: AuNRs have potential applications for clinical cancer therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Chromatographic fractions (polar to more non-polar with numbers increasing) of the extract were evaluated for toxicity and estrogenic activity using medaka and an estrogen receptor (ER) cell-line. Fractions 6 and 9 had the highest estrogenic effects with relative hydrophobic chemicals. The vtg expression in fraction 6 was 22-fold higher than control, and the ER cellular response in fraction 9 was 8.5-fold higher than controls. Following non-target screening (NTS), several novel phthalates and phenols were identified in the above two fractions. Fractions 1 and 2 appeared to be primarily responsible for the acute toxicity observed with the whole extract. The hatching rate decreased to 36 % in fraction 2, and was not observed following exposure to fraction 1. NTS of these fractions indicated 635 and 808 entities, respectively, most without toxicity information.

There are no data on PHCs in coral reef biota from tropical islands in the western Indian Ocean (WIO). For this assessment, three hard coral genera, two soft coral genera, and ember parrotfish (Scarus rubroviolaceus) were collected from the remote Rodrigues, Agalega, and St. Brandon's Atoll (Republic of Mauritius) in the Mascarene Basin of the WIO.

We quantified DP, currently a candidate POP, in coral reef biota. PBT was measured in all samples also suggests long-range transport. Because the hard coral, soft coral, and fish had differing concentrations and patterns of PHCs, future surveys should stratify sampling accordingly.

We collated information on which specific items were ingested and responsible for causing death across 80 marine species, including cetaceans, pinnipeds, sea turtles, and seabirds. We evaluated which items were responsible for the highest mortality, and which, if reduced by policy responses or other means, could result in the largest reduction in debris mortality. A limited number of consumer items were shown to be responsible for most megafauna deaths. Flexible plastic is responsible for the largest proportion of debris deaths, primarily due to gastric obstructions. Disproportionately lethal items included plastic bags/sheets/packaging, rope/fishing nets, fishing tackle and balloons/latex. Smaller items, including ""microplastics,"" though abundant, were seldom implicated in mortality. We provide suggestions to directly curb debris deaths of marine megafauna by prioritizing policies that would reduce or eliminate the input of disproportionately hazardous items into the marine system.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

It reduces the aesthetic appeals of the beaches in the country. The current study investigates marine debris on six different beaches of Brunei Darussalam along the South China Sea. Plastic was found the most abundant among whole debris by number ( 90.02%) and by weight (39.12%). It was classified by size (micro (<5 mm), meso (5-20 mm), macro (21-100), and mega (>100 mm)), colour (transparent, coloured, white and black). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to investigate the types of plastics and additives present in it. Statistical analysis using Minitab 17 and Kruskal-Wallis test was performed for comparison of data at different study sites. All major types of plastics were found in different forms with varying quantities from which toxic chemicals may leach out during degradation. The highest abundance by the number of plastic debris was found on Muara beach with a mean value 74.428 n/m(2) +/- 34.33 n/m(2), while the lowest abundance was found on Lumut beach 53 n/m(2) +/- 20.9 n/m(2).

Cu/UiO-66 was prepared by coordinate bonding of metal organic framework (MOF) nanomaterial UiO-66 with copper ions. Cu/UiO-66 contains a large number of metal defect sites, which can be combined with phosphate-modified nucleic acid aptamers through strong coordination between phosphate and zirconium to form ""fluorescence turn-on"" sensors. In the absence of CAP, all single-stranded aptamers were adsorbed on the surface of Cu/UiO-66 through pi-pi stacking between single-stranded DNA and Cu/UiO-66, which brings the ROX fluorophores and Cu/UiO-66 into close proximity. The ROX fluorescence of aptamers was then quenched by Cu/UiO-66 through photoinduced electron transfer (PET). In the presence of CAP, however, CAP reacted with nucleic acid aptamers to form a special spatial structure, in which the ROX fluorophores were far away from the MOF surface via a change in the spatial structure of the aptamers, and the fluorescence of ROX was able to be recovered. The quantitative detection of CAP can be achieved by measuring the fluorescence signal of ROX using synchronous scanning fluorescence spectrometry. Under optimum conditions, the fluorescence intensities of ROX exhibit a good linear dependence on the concentration of CAP in the range of 0.2-10 nmol/L, with a detection limit of 0.09 nmol/L. The method has advantages of high sensitivity, good selectivity, and a low limit of detection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

There are no global estimates of benthic litter because of the scarcity of data and only patchy survey coverage. However, estimates of baseline abundance and composition of litter are vital in order to implement litter reduction policies and adequate monitoring schemes. Two large-scale surveys of submarine geomorphological features in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans reveal that litter was found at all locations, despite their remoteness. Litter abundance was patchy, but both surveyed oceans had sites of high litter density. There was a significant difference in the type of litter found in the two oceans, with the Indian Ocean sites being dominated by fishing gear, whereas the Atlantic Ocean sites displayed a greater mix of general refuse. This study suggests that seabed litter is ubiquitous on raised benthic features, such as seamounts. It also concludes that the pattern of accumulation and composition of the litter is determined by a complex range of factors both environmental and anthropogenic. We suggest that the tracing of fishing effort and gear type would be an important step to elucidate hotspots of litter abundance on seamounts, ridges and banks.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

In an attempt to identify the main knowledge gaps and to suggest future research, we discuss priority topics on marine plastic pollution through ten thought-provoking questions on the current knowledge of multiple consequences of plastics on the marine ecosystem. Our investigation found that the majority of knowledge gaps include not only intrinsic aspects of plastics (e.g. quantification, typology, fate), but also biological, ecological and legislative implications (e.g. ingestion rate by wildlife, biomagnification across food webs, spread of alien species, consequences for human nutrition, mitigation measures). The current scenario shows that science is still far from assessing the real magnitude of the impact that plastics have on the sea. In particular, the transfer of plastics across marine trophic levels emerged as one of the most critical knowledge gaps. Current regulations seem not sufficient to tackle the massive release of plastics into the sea. Within this complex picture, a positive note is the ever-increasing public awareness. The release of plastics into the sea is certainly a serious environmental issue that can be effectively addressed only through the combined efforts of the three main stakeholders: ordinary citizens through more eco-friendly behaviours, scientists by filling knowledge gaps, and policymakers by passing conservation laws relying on prevention and scientific evidence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Dying marine organisms caught in the fishing nets are few examples of physical damage through PS. However, the fact that weathering plastics ending up as micro and nano particles threatening life, especially marine life, is new. Plastics in addition sequestrate persistent organic pollutants from water and pass them on to marine food web. An international pellet watch program has been initiated based on this property of PS.

In this work, we compared solid-phase microextraction (SPME) to ultrasonic assisted solvent extraction (UASE) as sample preparation methods for the liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) determination of phthalates in fish fillets. UASE was carried out with an acetone-hexane (1:1) solution and according to a reference procedure aimed to obtain the exhaustive extraction of the target analytes. SPME was carried out by applying C18 fibers in direct immersion mode and by using water/methanol 20:80 mixture to desorb the aliquot required for the analysis. Overall, SPME displayed an improved control of the background contamination and enabled lower LOQs. Precision, calculated as relative standard deviation (RSD) on replicates of a reference sample, was below 24% for both the method.

In an attempt to enhance Styrofoam buoy marine debris management, this paper used document analysis, participative workshops and interviews to identify areas of concern regarding current management measures and propose recommendations. The results found that failure to impose buoy recovery, inevitable loss of buoys and unavailability of equally competitive, eco-friendly alternative buoys are major areas of concern. Built on the modes of governance (hierarchical, market and participative), the paper proposed recommendations, including enhancing farmer self-governance units' capacity to manage derelict fishing gear (DFG), strengthening Styrofoam buoy recovery, increasing farmers' awareness of DFG, developing eco-friendly buoys, instituting an ecolabeling program for Styrofoam-free oysters. The recommendations involve participation of farmers, decision makers and consumers and mostly rely on the government's initiation and support. The paper particularly highlighted the political sensitivity of a recommendation regarding phasing out the use of Styrofoam buoys and suggested it serve as a last resort and be practiced depending on fulfillment of circumstantial situations.

The stomach contents of 92 G. genidens (26 juveniles and 66 adults) were analyzed. The Index of Relative Importance was performed to identify the contribution of each prey item. Condition factor (CF) was used to analyze the effect of plastic ingestion on the fish's body condition (by comparing individuals in the same ontogenetic phase).

For the adults, 12 items were observed, the most important of which were Penaeidae, Portunidae, Polychaeta, and plastic. The analysis of CF demonstrated higher values for individuals without plastic in the stomach, which indicated a better health condition. The CF of a fish may be affected by variations in the physiological condition, environmental stresses, and nutritional and biological variations, and could be used to compare the body condition or health of a fish species.

Methods: This study was conducted on 5,402 adults aged 19 years and older (2,488 men, 2,914 women) based on the second Korean National Environmental Health Survey (2012-2014). We stratified the data according to gender and analyzed urinary BPA concentrations in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, health behavior, dietary factor, and seafood consumption. In the high and low BPA exposure groups, the odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression analysis according to the top 75th percentile concentration.        Results: In men, large fish and tuna and other seafood categories had significantly higher ORs before and after adjustment in the group who consumed seafood more than once a week than in the group who rarely consumed seafood, with an adjusted value of 1.97 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-3.48) and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.10-2.75), respectively. In the shellfish category, the unadjusted OR was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.00-2.59), which was significantly higher in the group who consumed seafood more than once a week than in the group who rarely consumed seafood. However, the OR after adjusting for the variables was not statistically significant. In women, the frequency of seafood consumption and the concentration of urinary BPA were not significantly associated.        Conclusions: BPA concentration was higher in men who frequently consumed large fish and tuna, shellfish and other seafood in this study.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

ML surveys were conducted every season in a total of 8 beach monitoring sites during 2015-2016. Eight main categories of material were determined, based on standard OSPAR monitoring protocol. Annual accumulation of 19,805 nos. was recorded. The highest was the quantity of items related to artificial polymer materials category - 16,690 nos. The most dominant in this category were cigarette butts and filters 4496 nos., followed by plastic caps/lids drinks - 1413 nos. and cups and cup lids - 1194 nos. The highest was the abundance of most of the litter during the summer period, related to the increased number of beach visitors, numerous temporarily working fast - food eateries, some big and small restaurants and cafes in close proximity to the beaches, as well as fishing, wild camping, etc.        The contribution of ML types to the coastal pollution, presented by number and weight of items was determined. The highest was the contribution (by number) of cigarette butts and filters - 29.7%, followed by plastic caps/lids of beverages - 9.4%; plastic cups and cup lids - 7.9%, etc. According to the weight drink bottles > 5 L exhibited highest percentage - 30.7%, followed by shopping bags incl. pieces - 15.5% and drink bottles <= 0.5 L - 13.2%. The ML accumulation, presented by number and weight gives more detailed information about litter characteristics, the levels of coastal pollution and improves ML management. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This study analysed the issue of marine plastic litter pollution in the context of the Descriptor 10 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and Good Environmental Status of the oceans and seas. The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework was used to assess the causes, effects, and management measures to changes in the marine environment resulting from marine plastics pollution. We noted that less than 10 peer-reviewed publications have applied the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model to the issue of marine plastics pollution. Some basic needs such as food security, movement of goods and services, and shelter are also some of the major drivers of marine plastic pollution. The use of plastics is linked to multiple economic sectors (fisheries, agriculture, transport, packaging, construction) and other human activities. A significant amount of the resulting pressures came from the economic sectors for packaging and construction. State changes occurred at the environmental (contamination and bioaccumulation), ecosystem (ingestion of plastics, ghost fishing) and ecosystem service levels (supply of sea food, salt and cultural benefits), with possible loss of jobs and income being some of the observed impacts on human welfare. Responses as management measures, which are tailored to meet each component of the DPSIR framework, were identified. These included policies, regulations, technological advancement and behavioural change. The research acknowledges the issue of marine plastics pollution as a global environmental problem and recommends a trans-disciplinary approach, involving all types of stakeholders. Future research and analysis applying the DPSIR framework will be useful to provide the information necessary for the effective, adaptive management of litter pollution by marine plastics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

A total of 120 sampling sites were spread out over the near-shore waters along 1,500 km of coastline during seven cruises performed during 2016 and 2017. Plastic debris, dominated by millimeter-sized pieces, was constituted mostly of fragments of rigid objects (73%) followed by pieces of films (17%), fishing lines (6%), and foam (4%). These fragments were mainly made up by polyethylene (69%) and polypropylene (21%). Fibers, likely released from synthetic textiles, were ubiquitous and abundant, although were analyzed independently due to the risk of including non-plastic fibers and airborne contamination of samples in spite of the precautions taken. The plastic concentrations (excluding possible plastic fibers) contrasts with those found in other semi-closed seas, such as the neighboring Mediterranean. They were relatively low all over the Red Sea (<50,000 items km(-2); mean +/- SD = 3,546 +/- 8,154 plastic item km(-2), 1.1 +/- 3.0 g km(-2)) showing no clear spatial relationship with the distribution of coastal population. Results suggests a low plastic waste input from land as the most plausible explanation for this relative shortage of plastic in the surface waters of the Red Sea; however, the additional intervention of particular processes of surface plastic removal by fish or the filtering activity of the extensive coral reefs along the coastline cannot be discarded. In addition, our study highlights the relevance of determining specific regional conversion rates of mismanaged plastic waste to marine debris, accounting for the role of near-shore activities (e.g., beach tourism, recreational navigation), in order to estimate plastic waste inputs into the ocean.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

This area, considered a Vulnerable Marine Ecosystem by The Food and Agriculture Organization because of its ecological importance and biodiversity value, is affected by various pressures and threats that may act as sources of marine litter. The aim of this paper was to analyse the composition and distribution of marine litter on the seafloor of this archipelago with a specific focus on the hydrothermal areas, using almost 60 h of remotely operated vehicle footage collected at depths of 15 to 411 m. Derelict fishing gear represented the main source of marine debris (71.9% of the overall litter); nevertheless, the observed mean litter density was quite low (0.57 items/100 m(2)) when compared with other Mediterranean areas, probably because fisheries in the area mainly use pelagic gear that has a low impact on the seabed. No differences were found in litter densities between hydrothermal and non-hydrothermal zones. The occurrence of benthic fauna impacted by debris was rarely recorded (only 10.6% of litter items showed interactions with species) and entanglement was the most commonly observed impact. However, both the density of synthetic fishing gear and its impact on habitats and species are bound to increase overtime. Overall, plastics constituted most of the marine litter (79.7%).So, prevention and mitigation measures are needed in order to protect this sensitive ecosystem. To this end, the most effective strategy could be the establishment of a Marine Protected Area or a Site of Community Importance, due to the presence of habitats (""submarine structures made by leaking gases"" and ""reefs"") listed in Annex I of the European Habitats Directive, where all fishing activities could be strictly regulated.

With the rapid increase in global plastics production and the resulting large volume of litter that enters the marine environment, determining the consequences of this debris on marine fauna and ocean health has now become a critical environmental priority, particularly for threatened and endangered species. However, there are limited data about the impacts of debris on marine species from which to draw conclusions about the population consequences of anthropogenic debris. To address this knowledge gap, information was elicited from experts on the ecological threat (both severity and specificity) of entanglement, ingestion and chemical contamination for three major marine taxa: seabirds, sea turtles and marine mammals. The threat assessment focused on the most common types of litter that are found along the world's coastlines, based on data gathered during three decades of international coastal clean-up efforts. Fishing related gear, balloons and plastic bags were estimated to pose the greatest entanglement risk to marine fauna. In contrast, experts identified a broader suite of items of concern for ingestion, with plastic bags and plastic utensils ranked as the greatest threats. Entanglement and ingestion affected a similar range of taxa, although entanglement was rated as slightly worse because it is more likely to be lethal. Contamination was scored the lowest in terms of impact, affecting a smaller portion of the taxa and being rated as having solely non-lethal impacts. This work points towards a number of opportunities both for policy-based and consumer-driven changes in plastics use that could have demonstrable affects for a range of ecologically important taxa that serve as indicators of marine ecosystem health.

Among all the substances conforming the plastic items, the effects of a dietary Bisphenol A (BPA) and Di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP) have been evaluated in adult male gilthead sea bream, focusing on their effects in the modulation of the Endocannabinoid System (ECS). In zebrafish, the ECS has been recently chosen as a new target for the activity of some Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDC), since it represents a complex lipid signaling network essential for the well-being of the organisms. The results obtained in gilthead seabream showed that BPA and DiNP altered the structure and the biochemical composition of liver, increasing the presence of lipids and triglycerides and decreasing the glycogen and phospholipids. Moreover, the addition of BPA or DiNP in the gilthead sea bream diet altered the levels of endocannabinoids (EC) and EC-like mediators in the liver. These alterations were also associated to changes at the transcriptomic level of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and ECS metabolism. At the central level, both BPA and DiNP reduced the expression of the endocannabinoid receptor type I (cnrl) and the neuropeptide Y (npy) as well as the levels of the endocannabinoid Anandamide (AEA), suggesting a downregulation of appetite. The results herein reported highlighted the negative effects of chronic dietary exposure to DiNP or BPA on ECS functions and lipid metabolism of male gilthead sea bream liver, showing a similar disruptive activity of these contaminants at metabolic level. Moreover, the novelty of the biomarkers used evidenced possible innovative endpoints for the development of novel OEDCS test guidelines.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",,

To assess the plausibility of such findings, both natural and man-made fibers were examined using FT-IR spectroscopy. Spectra acquired by transmission microscopy, attenuated total reflection (ATR) microscopy, and ATR spectroscopy were compared. Library search was employed and results show significant differences in the identification rate depending on the acquisition method of the spectra. Careful selection of search parameters and the choice of spectra acquisition method were found to be essential for optimization of the library search results. When using transmission spectra of fibers and ATR libraries it was not possible to differentiate between man-made and natural fibers. Successful differentiation of natural and man-made cellulosic fibers has been achieved for FT-IR spectra acquired by ATR microscopy and ATR spectroscopy, and application of ATR libraries. As an alternative, chemometric methods such as unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and partial least squares-discriminant analysis were employed to facilitate identification based on intrinsic relationships of sample spectra and successful discrimination of the fiber type could be achieved. Differences in the ATR spectra depending on the internal reflection element (Ge versus diamond) were observed as expected; however, these did not impair correct classification by chemometric analysis. Moreover, the effects of different levels of humidity on the IR spectra of natural and man-made fibers were investigated, too. It has been found that drying and re-humidification leads to intensity changes of absorption bands of the carbohydrate backbone, but does not impair the identification of the fiber type by library search or cluster analysis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,GAB: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

This study examined ingestion of >0.25 mm marine plastic debris (MPD) by four predatory fish species caught by commercial fishers around the Main Hawaiian Islands, and documented ingestion in three species: 85.7% of albacore tuna (n = 7), 40.0% of skipjack tuna (n = 10) and 12.5% of dolphinfish (n = 8).        Yellowfin tuna (n = 10) did not contain any MPD, probably owing to the high proportion of empty stomachs (60%).        For skipjack tuna, the frequency of occurrence of MPD ingestion was significantly higher for the smaller-sized specimens caught with pole-and-line (40%), compared with the larger-sized specimens caught with longlines (0%).        For dolphinfish, the frequency of occurrence of MPD ingestion was similar for the similar-sized specimens caught with pole-and-line and with longlines.        The ingested MPD items were micro-meso plastics, between 1 and 25 mm. While most ingested items were fragments, albacore also ingested line and skipjack also ingested sheets.        The predatory fishes ingested light MPD items that float in sea water, but there were species-specific differences in their polymer composition: albacore contained more polypropylene and polyethylene, and skipjack contained more elastomers, characterized by a high percentage of ester plasticizers.        Altogether, these results suggest that albacore and skipjack tunas ingest plastic of different types and polymers. Yet more research is needed to understand how differences in vertical distribution, foraging ecology and diet influence the MPD sampled by these predatory fish species.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Gabriel""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GAB: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,
