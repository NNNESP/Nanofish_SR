There is an urgent need to investigate whether MPFCs pose potential health risks, as a result of the migration of chemicals into foods. Herein, 42 intentionally added substances (IAS) and > 100 non-IAS (NIAS) migrating from MPFCs were identified in food simulants according to Regulation (EU). The migration of major IAS and NIAS was higher in 95% ethanol compared to other simulants, and gradually decreased following repeated use. NIAS, including Cramer class III toxic compounds, such as PEG oligomers of N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl) alkyl(C8â€“C18)amines, isomers of hexadecanamide and oleamide, and Irgafos 168 OXO were detected and exceeded the recommended limits in some MPFCs. Furthermore, microplastics (MPs) were detected with high values of over one million particles/L in some MPFCs in a single test, and migration behaviors of MPs in different MPFCs were diverse. Surprisingly, this rigorous migration might result in an annual intake of IAS/NIAS up to 55.15 mg and 150 million MPs particles if take-out food was consumed once a day. Multi-safety evaluation studies on the migration of various chemicals from MPFCs to foodstuffs during food preparation should be assessed.

Existing studies on atmospheric MPs are mostly derived from collection of atmospheric deposition, whereas direct measurements of airborne MPs are scarce. However, the abundance of airborne MPs is more relevant for evaluating human inhalation exposure risk. Herein, airborne MPs in indoor and outdoor environments from urban and rural areas of a coastal city in eastern China were investigated. MP concentrations (meanÂ±SD) in indoor air (1583 Â± 1180 n/m3) were an order of magnitude higher than outdoor air (189 Â± 85 n/m3), and airborne MP concentrations in urban areas (224 Â± 70 n/m3) were higher than rural areas (101 Â± 47 n/m3). MPs smaller than 100 Âµm dominated airborne MPs, and the predominant shape of airborne MPs was fragments, as opposed to fibers. The larger MP size fractions contained a higher proportion of fibers, whereas the smaller size fractions were nearly exclusively composed of fragments. The health risk caused by ubiquitous airborne MPs should not be discounted as the maximum annual outdoor exposure of airborne MPs can reach 1 million/year, while indoor exposure may be even higher due to higher indoor airborne MP concentrations.

Thus, the aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that the exposure of adult Danio rerio individuals to this pollutant for 30 days is enough to cause polylactic acid biomicroplastics (BioMPs of PLA) accumulation in their bodies, which leads to behavioral/neurotoxic, biochemical, and morphological changes. Based on our results, PLA BioMPs at concentrations of 2.5 and 5 mg/L accumulated in the liver, brain, gills and carcass of the assessed animals. However, such an accumulation was not able to cause locomotor damages or to trigger anxiety-like behavior in them. On the other hand, it was enough to cause behavioral changes (in shoal) predictive of co-specific social interaction and anti-predatory defensive response deficit likely related to cholinergic changes inferred by increased acetylcholinesterase activity and REDOX imbalance. This imbalance was featured by increased production of reactive species. We observed that the treatments have affected animalsâ€™ pigmentation pattern. Therefore, our study highlights the toxicological potential of the herein assessed biopolymer, and this finding puts in check the innocuousness of this material, as well as expands our knowledge about how PLA BioMPs can affect the ichthyofauna in freshwater environments.

Fish (29.6â€“31.5 g) were fed on diets supplemented with PP at levels of 0.0% (control), 3%, and 5% and exposed to sub-lethal levels of AgNPs (0.0 and 2.0 mg/L) for six weeks. The results showed that AgNPs exposure alone significantly suppressed the fish growth and elevated stress biomarkers (blood glucose and cortisol), induced liver damage (alanine and aspartate aminotransferases), and renal failure (creatinine and uric acid). Additionally, AgNPs exposure significantly decreased serum immune parameters (lysozyme activity, respiratory burst activity, and total immunoglobulin) and affected hepatic and renal oxidant/antioxidant biomarkers (superoxide dismutase, catalase, malondialdehyde, and reduced glutathione). Dietary supplementation of PP powder alone reduced the fish performance but markedly enhanced antioxidant and immunological activities. Additionally, dietary PP powder significantly mitigated AgNPs-induced effects, attenuating hepato-renal damage, oxidative stress, and immunity biomarkers. In conclusion, AgNPs adversely affected the performance of Nile tilapia; however, dietary supplementation of 5% PP powder effectively mitigated the oxidative stress and immune suppression resulted from AgNPs exposure.

However, improper and unregulated disposals of these DPFs has been and will continue to intensify the plastic pollution problem we are already facing. This study focuses on the emission of pollutants from 7 DPF brands that were submerged in water to simulate environmental conditions if these DPFs were littered. The DPF leachates were filtered by inorganic membranes, and both particle-deposited organic membranes and the filtrates were characterized using techniques such as FTIR, SEM-EDX, Light Microscopy, ICP-MS and LC-MS. Micro and nano scale polymeric fibres, particles, siliceous fragments and leachable inorganic and organic chemicals were observed from all of the tested DPFs. Traces of concerning heavy metals (i.e. lead up to 6.79 Âµg/L) were detected in association with silicon containing fragments. ICP-MS also confirmed the presence of other leachable metals like cadmium (up to 1.92 Âµg/L), antimony (up to 393 Âµg/L) and copper (up to 4.17 Âµg/L). LC-MS analysis identified polar leachable organic species related to plastic additives and contaminants; polyamide-66 monomer and oligomers (nylon-66 synthesis), surfactant molecules, dye-like molecules and polyethylene glycol were all tentatively identified in the leachate. The toxicity of some of the chemicals found and the postulated risks of the rest of the present particles and molecules, raises the question of whether DPFs are safe to be used on a daily basis and what consequences are to be expected after their disposal into the environment.

One particular issue that warrants further characterization is the hazards associated with chemical additives within micro (nano)plastic as they are not chemically bound within the polymers and can be persistent and biologically active. Most plastics contain additives and are therefore potential vectors for the introduction of these chemicals into the environment as they leach from plastic, a process that can be accelerated through degradation and weathering processes. There are knowledge gaps on the ecotoxicological effects of plastic additives and how they are released from parent plastic materials as they progressively fragment from the meso to micro and nano scale. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of the ecotoxicity of plastic additives and identifies research needs to characterize the hazard they present to exposed biota. The potential ecological risk of chemical additives is of international concern so key differences in governance between the European Union and New Zealand to appropriately characterize their risk are highlighted.

Seabirds have been identified as vectors of chemical contaminants from marine to terrestrial environments, and studies have recently identified seabirds as possible vectors of plastic pollution in the marine environment. However, their role in the distribution of microplastic pollution in the Arctic has yet to be explored. We examined two species of seabirds known to ingest plastics: northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis; n = 27) and thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia; n = 30) as potential vectors for the transport of microplastics in and around breeding colonies. Our results indicated anthropogenic particles in the faecal precursors of both species. Twenty-four anthropogenic particles were found in the fulmar faecal precursor samples (M = 0.89, SD = 1.09; 23 fibres and one fragment), and 10 anthropogenic particles were found in the murre faecal precursor samples (M = 0.33, SD = 0.92; 5 fibres, 4 fragments, and one foam). Through the use of bird population surveys and the quantification of anthropogenic particles found in the faecal precursors of sampled seabirds from the same colony, we estimate that fulmars and murres may deposit between 3.3 (CIboot 1.9 Ã— 106â€“4.9 Ã— 106) and 45.5 (CIboot 9.1 Ã— 106â€“91.9 Ã— 106) million anthropogenic particles, respectively, per year into the environment during their breeding period at these colonies. These estimates indicate that migratory seabirds could be contributing to the distribution and local hotspots of microplastics in Arctic environments, however, they are still likely a relatively small source of plastic pollution in terms of mass in the environment and may not contribute as much as other reported sources such as atmospheric deposition in the Arctic.

Concerns about potential impacts on marine organisms are usually associated with uptake of microplastics, especially via ingestion. This study used environmentally relevant exposure conditions to investigate microplastic ingestion and depuration kinetics of the planktivorous damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis. Irregular shaped blue polypropylene (PP) particles (longest length 125â€“250 Î¼m), and regular shaped blue polyester (PET) fibers (length 600â€“700 Î¼m) were selected based on physical and chemical characteristics of microplastics commonly reported in the marine environment, including in coral reef ecosystems. Individual adult damselfish were exposed to a single dose of PP particles and PET fibers at concentrations reported for waters of the Great Barrier Reef (i.e., environmentally relevant concentrations, ERC), or future projected higher concentrations (10x ERC, 100x ERC). Measured microplastic concentrations were similar to their nominal values, confirming that PP particles and PET fibers were present at the desired concentrations and available for ingestion by individual damselfish. Throughout the 128-h depuration period, the 88 experimental fish were sampled 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128-h post microplastic exposure and their gastrointestinal tracts (GIT) analyzed for ingested microplastics. While damselfish ingested both experimental microplastics at all concentrations, body burden, and depuration rates of PET fibers were significantly larger and longer, respectively, compared to PP particles. For both microplastic types, exposure to higher concentrations led to an increase in body burden and lower depuration rates. These findings confirm ingestion of PP particles and PET fibers by P. amboinensis and demonstrate for the first time the influence of microplastic characteristics and concentrations on body burden and depuration rates. Finally, despite measures put in place to prevent contamination, extraneous microplastics were recovered from experimental fish, highlighting the challenge to completely eliminate contamination in microplastic exposure studies. These results are critical to inform and continuously improve protocols for future microplastics research, and to elucidate patterns of microplastic contamination and associated risks in marine organisms.

Metabonomics data confirmed that, the oxidative stress on embryos and the demand for cellular energy induced by Cd were increased in the combined treatment of Cd and n-PS, which might be due to the barrier action of n-PS on embryonic chorion.

A standardized autopsy included evaluation of condition, bacteriological and histopathological analyzes. Tissues were analyzed for MP (>10Â Âµm) by pyrolysis Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (py-GCMS) and inspected by polarized light microscopy. We analyzed samples of stomach and intestinal wall, liver and muscle/fillet from three flounders, three cod, three seabirds, three otters and one seal, kidneys from seabirds, otters and the seal, and gills from the fishes. No large plastic items were observed in the gastrointestinal tracts. Eight of 13 animals had MP in one or several tissues. MP was found in intestine (5), stomach (4), liver (3), muscle (3). No MP was found in the seal, and only in the stomach wall of one otter. In seabirds, MP was found in the intestine, stomach and liver, but not muscle. The highest concentration was 3.4Â Âµg/g wet weight in cod liver. Three of the nine investigated polymers were found above the Limit of Quantification (LOQ): Polyvinylchloride>polystyrene>>polyethylene terephthalate. MP was quantified in one of four replicates of cod muscle and one of two replicates of cod liver. No MP was observed by microscopy. The results show levels under or close to the current LOQ. Replicates indicate uneven MP distribution in tissues and resulted in higher prevalence of MP for cod. No adverse effects could be related to MP. The sample size was small, and conclusions cannot be drawn regarding effects or risks. The animals were by-catch, and mostly in good condition when caught. Procedural blanks and air-controls showed very low MP, and support that the MP come from environmental sources.

The target microplastics for risk assessment were specified as only non-spherical type microplastics in the size range 20â€“300 Î¼m, because this type was predominantly observed in our study areas, and adverse biological effects have previously been reported. Exposure data for non-spherical microplastics were obtained from a previous study or were measured for microplastics of sizes down to 20 Î¼m. A predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) of 12 particles/L was derived by employing a species sensitivity distribution approach. Then the results were compared to the in situ observed concentrations at each site. The detected microplastic concentrations did not exceed the derived PNEC, i.e., the current pollution levels of fragment and fiber microplastics in the size range 20â€“300 Î¼m would not pose a significant threat to the marine ecosystem in South Korea. However, predictions are that microplastic pollution will increase to 50-fold by 2100 at the current rates, and in this scenario, the microplastic concentration is expected to far exceed the derived PNEC values for marine ecosystems.

Initially, the surface of PDMS film was chemically modified by piranha solution and 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), and then AuNPs-PDMS film was prepared by coating gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) through electrostatic interaction. Next, the aptamers were immobilized on the AuNPs-PDMS membrane via gold-sulfur bond to form the capture substrate. Meanwhile, gold-silver core-shell nanoflowers (Au@Ag NFs) modified with mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) and aptamers were applied as a signal probe. In the presence of the target, the signal molecular probe and the capturing substrate specifically combined with the target and resulted in a sandwich structure â€œcapture substrate-target-signal molecular probeâ€. Under the optimized experimental condition, the signal of 4-MBA at 1085 cm-1 was linearly related to the S. aureus concentration in the range of 4.3 Ã— 10 cfu mLâˆ’1-4.3 Ã— 107 cfu mLâˆ’1 (y = 326.91x-117.62, R2 = 0.9932) with a detection limit of 13 cfu mLâˆ’1.

Reservoirs are an enclosed aquatic environment at risk from accumulation of microplastics. Few studies have used fish species as bio-indicators to monitor microplastic contamination in reservoirs. Freshwater fish were caught by local fishermen from 10 stations around the Ubolratana Reservoir, Thailand in October 2018 and the abundance, size, color and shape of microplastic particles in their stomachs and intestines were investigated. Fourteen fish species were examined. Results showed that 96.4% of the fish had ingested microplastics at mean abundance of 2.92+1.30 particles per fish, with significant differences of abundance between species. Microplastic abundance was highest in carnivorous fish Parambassis siamensis (4.11+1.08 particles per fish). The most common size of ingested microplastics was over 0.5 mm (66.4%), with 51.0% as blue color and 98.2% fiber shaped. High levels of microplastics were ingested by fish located in the middle and lower parts of the reservoir. Results revealed that blue fiber microplastics dominantly observed in fish were derived from the breakdown of nets used for fishing activities. Â© Int. J. of GEOMATE.

The production of plastics is increasing dramatically throughout the world and is considered to be a serious threat for the aquatic environment. Scientists started to raise questions as to where all the disappeared plastic debris had gone, as the plastic material is a persistent synthetic polymer. The disappearance of plastic suggests that microplastics are generated by fragmentation of larger plastic debris. They also enter the aquatic environment from the cosmetics, clothing, and other industrial manufacturing. Microplastic particles spread in the aquatic, terrestrial, and atmospheric environments due to their small size and ubiquity, showing their high bioavailability. The presence of microplastics has been demonstrated in the digestive tracts of most aquatic organisms at various trophic levels. Evidence of negative effects of microplastics has been found in relation to fertility, mortality, oxidative stress, immune system or metabolic processes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibiofilm activity of ZnO/ZeoNC against K. pneumoniae along with the biocompatibility of the nanocomposite in vi-vo model. Objective: The formation of biofilm by K. pneumoniae in the catheter-associated urinary tract causes a nosocomial infection. In this regard, antimicrobial nanomaterials have emerged as potent effective agents against biofilm formation. Nevertheless, nanoparticles have already been a chal-lenge with possible side effects such as inflammation. The ZnO/ZeoNC may exhibit anti-biofilm property with minimal adverse effects. Methods: The biofilm formation of K. pneumoniae strains was exposed to ZnO/ZeoNC and then SEM imaging was performed for morphological investigation of bacteria in biofilm state. The response to ZnO/ZeoNC embedded polyethylene tube of the tissue of mice was also analyzed during the 30-day experiment. Results: The results of this study showed that ZnO/ZeoNC has significant antibiofilm activity against K. pneumoniae strains in its sublethal doses. The ZnO/ZeoNC also caused deformation in K. pneumoniae biofilm. In addition, ZnO/ZeoNC also reduced inflammatory response in cell tissue of rats subjected to polyethylene tube.

Spatial repellents have been used as preventative measures via direct application to the skin or disposable devices worn outside of clothing. Naturally derived, plant-based repellents are safe, effective alternatives to synthetic repellents and may be applied to disposable substrates including adhesive patches. Many disposables are composed of synthetic petrochemical-based polyester and polypropylene nonwoven fabrics, contributing to growing concern surrounding microplastic pollution. Sustainable and biodegradable substrates including those made from cotton are cost effective and environmentally friendly. Therefore, we explored the utilization of cotton-based substrates for the application of natural spatial and synthetic contact insect repellents. Cotton fibers used in the study were commercially available greige cotton, scoured and bleached greige cotton and reginned greige cotton motes, a value-added byproduct of the ginning process. Synthetic polyester and polypropylene were used for comparison. Thermogravimetric/derivative thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTG) in combination with modulated differential scanning calorimetry (mDSC) were used to discern vaporization properties of repellents from the substrates. Retention times of repellents on the substrates were analyzed using a Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopyâ€“focal plane array detector and compared with the TG/DTG and mDSC data. Mosquito landing assays confirmed the feasibility of using cotton-based substrates treated with plant-based spatial repellents as an effective and environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic materials.

Cellulose and plastic fibers have been found in the lungs of patients with lung cancer, indicating that MPs can ""travel"" through the atmosphere into the respiratory tract. Due to the hydrophobicity and relatively large surface area of MPs, the biotoxicity of MPs is greatly enhanced by their adsorption and enrichment in persistent organic pollutants (POPs). With the rapid development of the economy, emissions from coal burning and automobile exhaust have made polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) one of the key pollutants in urban air that cannot be ignored. Epidemiological studies have shown that PAH exposure is associated with the development of respiratory diseases, such as bronchitis and asthma, in children. The aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory effects of co-exposure to different size polystyrene MPs (PS-MPs) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) on adult zebrafish gills and bronchial-related cells to provide basic information for assessment of the potential health risks of combined exposure to the human respiratory system. PS-MPs (with size of 0.5 and 5 Î¼m) and BaP were co-administered to embryos for 7 d, adult zebrafish for 14 d, and HBE cells and HBMSCs for 48 h. The relative expression levels of inflammatory cytokine genes in the different exposure groups were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The ingestion of microplastics into fish bodies and cells was observed by stereoscope and confocal microscopy, respectively. Result shows that microplastics of two sizes could be ingested by zebrafish embryos. When exposed only to 0.5-Î¼m PS-MPs, relative expression of the TNF-Î±, IL-6, and IL-8 genes was significantly increased compared with that in the control; relative expression of the IFN-Î³ gene was largely increased in the gills of zebrafish in 5-Î¼m PS-MP-exposed group. Moreover, relative expression of the IFN-Î³, IL-6 and IL-8 genes in the group co-exposed to BaP and 0.5-Î¼m PS-MPs was higher than that in BaP group. In addition, 0.5-Î¼m PS-MPs could be ingested by both cell lines. Upon exposure to 0.5- Î¼m PS-MPs alone, relative expression of genes TNF-Î±, IL-6, and IL-8 was considerably increased compared with that in the control HBE cells. In HBSMCs, upon exposure to 0.5-Î¼m PS-MPs alone, relative expression of the TNF-Î±, IL-8, and IL-1Î² genes was substantially increased compared with that in the control group. Compared with that following exposure to BaP alone, relative expression of the IFN-Î³ and IL-6 genes in HBSMCs in 0.5-Î¼m PS-MPs and BaP co-exposure group was remarkably increased, indicating a possible combined effect; however, co-exposure of 5-Î¼m PS-MPs and BaP weakened the proinflammatory function of BaP and especially influenced relative expression of the TNF-Î± and IL-8 genes. In addition, none of the co-exposure groups of HBE cells showed obvious combined effects. The corollary is that particle size may affect the ingestion of PS-MPs in cells. In addition, the size-dependent effects of PS-MPs influence the accumulation of organic pollutants and their biotoxicity. Â© 2020, Science Press.

These have raised environmental concerns since its recent identification as pollutants. However, there are still no accurate models to assess their contribution to the microplastic pollution. Hence, in this study, a method to estimate the mass flow of microfibers detached from household laundry that reaches aquatic environments has been developed. The method considers a set of parameters related to the detachment of microfibers, which are, basically: (1) the detachment rate of microfibers from different textile garments, (2) the volume of laundry effluents, (3) the percentage of municipal water that has been treated, (4) the type of used-water treatment applied, and, (5) the proportion of front- versus top-loading washing machines. In this way, 0.28 million tons of microfibers per year were estimated to reach aquatic environments, which is approximately half than the last published valuation. Finally, hypothetical situations were simulated to evaluate the reduction of microfibers by the modification of some of the parameters at different levels (consumer, government entities, and industry). Thus, depending on the implanted alternatives, microfibers that reach the aquatic environments could be reduced between 30% and 65%. This work provides a base model to estimate the mass flow of textile microfibers from household laundry into aquatic environments.

Studies have shown that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are an important source of MP collection in the natural environment. This study investigated the removal efficiency and migration characteristics of MPs by sampling the sewage from each treatment section of a WWTP in Zhengzhou, China. The results showed that the abundance of MPs in the influent water and primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment discharges was 16.0, 10.3, 4.5, and 2.9 MP/L, respectively, and the total removal rate of MPs from the influent to the final effluent reached 81.9%. The MPs in the WWTP were mainly small-sized (0.08â€“0.55 mm), followed by medium-sized (0.55â€“1.7 mm). Fibers were the dominant MP shape in both the water and sediment samples. Black (36%) and red (23%) were the dominant MP colors. Six different polymer types of MPs were detected, which were mainly polypropylene followed by polyethylene. In general, for the MPs in the WWTP, the removal rate of fragments can reach 97.08%, which is better than that of fibers (70.50%); the removal rate of small-sized can reach 95.86%, which is better than that of medium-sized (83.53%) and large-sized (70.00%). In this study, primary treatment has better effects in eliminating fragments and large-sized MPs; secondary treatment has better effects in eliminating fibers and small-sized MPs. Although WWTPs have a very good removal effect on MPs, 870 million MP/d are still discharged into nearby rivers from WWTPs with a treatment scale of 300,000 m3/day.

Ocean eddies can retain zooplankton and plastic debris, and determine biological composition through advection. The conditions inside the gyre were stabilised by low chlorophyll-a concentrations and a deep nutricline. A diverse assemblage of mesopelagic fish, dominated by myctophids, exhibited diel migrations to the upper water layers for feeding since the early night. Myctophids were concentrated ca. 100 m depth, where the deep chlorophyll maximum was located, and coinciding with the nutricline. Another group of mesopelagic fish remained in deeper waters during the daytime, with a higher occurrence of Stomiiformes (Phoshycthyidae and Sternoptychidae) at the 500â€“600 m Deep Scattering Layer. Moreover, the diets of 220 myctophid specimens belonging to the species Ceratoscopelus warmingii, Diaphus effulgens, and Symbolophorus evermanni, were investigated based on stomach content analysis. Calanoid copepods, mainly Pleuromamma abdominalis, made up 30% of the diet in the three myctophid species, with interspecific differences in the preferred second item: C. warmingii preferred ostracods, D. effulgens, non-calanoid copepods, and S. evermanni, euphausiids. Thus, partial dietary segregation was observed among the three species. We hypothesized that these myctophid diets differed between stations located at the gyre core and its outer edge. Any dietary pattern indicating aggregation of food resources, or an enhancement of the foraging opportunities for myctophids, was discerned as an effect of the gyre advection. However, prey composition diverged between the core and the outer edge stations regardless of the fish species, with a higher dietary representation of P. abdominalis and euphausiids (migratory zooplankton) in the individuals collected in the core-influenced area. A total of six plastic pieces were present in the stomachs of D. effulgens and S. evermanni, in contrast with the high presence of plastic particles found at the surface in most sampling stations (average number of plastic pieces was 41 per hour).

The fish were captured in ten streams in Southern Brazil and the stomach contents of 294 individuals belonging to 13 species were analyzed. Individuals of ten species ingested MP of fiber type. From a generalized linear mixed model, we observed that the urbanized streams and the omnivorous habit showed a positive correlation with MP intake. Our results suggest that both types of streams present MP, but this pollutant is probably more prominent in heavily urbanized sites, which may represent important sources of MP for larger systems along the river basin. This evidences the importance of preserving riparian areas of small order streams as a means to reduce MP inputs into these ecosystems.

Small plastic particles, such as microplastics and nanoplastics, are easily ingested, and can act as a Trojan Horse by carrying microorganisms and pollutants. This study investigated the potential role of the Trojan Horse effect in the toxicity of nanoplastics to the vertebrate model organism, zebrafish (Danio rerio). First, we investigated if this effect could affect the toxicity of nanoplastics. Second, we analyzed if it could contribute to the biodistribution of the associated contaminants. And third, we focused on its effect on the mitochondrial toxicity of nanoplastics. We incubated 44 nm polystyrene nanoparticles with a real-world mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for 7 days and removed the free PAHs by ultrafiltration. We dosed embryos with 1 ppm of nanoplastics (NanoPS) or PAH-sorbed nanoplastics (PAH-NanoPS). Neither type of plastic particle caused changes in embryonic and larval development. Fluorescence microscopy and increased EROD activity suggested the uptake of PAHs in larvae exposed to PAH-NanoPS. This coincided with higher concentrations in the yolk sac and the brain. However, PAH-only exposure leads to their accumulation in the yolk sac but not in the brain, suggesting that that the spatial distribution of bioaccumulated PAHs can differ depending on their source of exposure. Both nanoplastic particles affected mitochondrial energy metabolism but caused different adverse effects. While NanoPS decreased NADH production, PAH-NanoPS decreased mitochondrial coupling efficiency and spare respiratory capacity. In summary, the addition of PAHs to the surface of nanoplastics did not translate into increased developmental toxicity. Low levels of PAHs were accumulated in the organisms, and the transfer of PAHs seems to happen in tissues and possibly organelles where nanoplastics accumulate. Disruption of the energy metabolism in the mitochondria may be a key factor in the toxicity of nanoplastics, and the Trojan Horse effect may amplify this effect.

Despite their relevance, effect studies on fish exposed via trophic chains are currently very scarce. MPs are known to contain many chemicals that could be transferred to organisms and induce deleterious effects. However, there is currently no consensus on whether MPs represent a significant exposure pathway to chemicals in contaminated habitats. Here, we exposed three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to polyethylene MPs via prey ingestion, in a one-month experiment. MPs were either pristine or spiked with chlorpyrifos (CPF), and a CPF control was included toÂ§compare vector effects of MPs and natural prey. Following exposure, we assessed AChE activity and fish behavior (feeding, locomotion, environment exploration and reaction to the introduction of a novel object). No effect was observed in fish exposed to pristine MPs. CPF accumulation was observed in fish exposed to CPF-spiked MPs (MP-CPF), confirming the vector potential of MPs. However, CPF accumulation was more important in fish exposed to CPF via prey. In fish exposed to MP-CPF, we observed significant AChE inhibition and hyperactivity, which could result in increased vulnerability to predation.

With the continuous increase in production and associated emissions and discharges, they can reach concentrations able to exceed toxicity thresholds for living species inhabiting marine coastal areas. Behavior and fate of NPs in marine waters are driven by transformation processes occurring as a function of NP intrinsic and extrinsic properties in the receiving seawaters. All those aspects have been overlooked in ecological risk assessment. This review critically reports ecotoxicity studies in which size distribution, surface charges and bioâˆ’nano interactions have been considered for a more realistic risk assessment of NPs in marine environment. Two emerging and relevant NPs, the metal-based titanium dioxide (TiO2), and polystyrene (PS), a proxy for nanoplastics, are reviewed, and their impact on marine biota (from planktonic species to invertebrates and fish) is discussed as a function of particle size and surface charges (negative vs. positive), which affect their behavior and interaction with the biological material. Uptake of NPs is related to their nanoscale size; however, in vivo studies clearly demonstrated that transformation (agglomerates/aggregates) occurring in both artificial and natural seawater drive to different exposure routes and biological responses at cellular and organism level. Adsorption of single particles or agglomerates onto the body surface or their internalization in feces can impair motility and affect sinking or floating behavior with consequences on populations and ecological function. Particle complex dynamics in natural seawater is almost unknown, although it determines the effective exposure scenarios. Based on the latest predicted environmental concentrations for TiO2 and PS NPs in the marine environment, current knowledge gaps and future research challenges encompass the comprehensive study of bioâˆ’nano interactions. As such, the analysis of NP biomolecular coronas can enable a better assessment of particle uptake and related cellular pathways leading to toxic effects. Moreover, the formation of an environmentally derived corona (i.e., eco-corona) in seawater accounts for NP physicalâ€“chemical alterations, rebounding on interaction with living organisms and toxicity.

However, the effects of these pollutants on animal species such as amphibians remain poorly known. Thus, the aim of the current study is to investigate whether the short exposure (7 days) of Physalaemus cuvieri tadpoles to PE MPs (60 mg/L) can change their behavior. Collected data have shown that PE MP accumulation in tadpoles was associated with different behavioral changes observed in them; this outcome has confirmed the behavioral toxicity of these micropollutants in the investigated species. Tadpoles subjected to PE MPs presented locomotion issues, anxiogenic effect symptoms, as well as anti-predatory defensive response deficit when they were exposed to predators (Cyprinus carpio). Data analysis enabled inferring to what extent these pollutants can affect individuals, and their natural predators living in contaminated areas. Based on the biological viewpoint, these changes can affect their defensive response to predators, as well as their social behavior. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was pioneer in reporting PE MPs-induced behavioral toxicity in representatives of amphibian groups.

New studies are being carried out to determine the critical challenges posed by the presence of these plastics in the ecosystem. In this review, the sources of micro- and nanoplastic contamination are described, highlighting their abundance and their environmental fate after being released. Moreover, their role in affecting aquatic organisms and the mechanisms involved are clarified. Some insights into their impacts on human health and the challenges faced by researchers in measuring both types of plastics extracted from biota are also presented. Assessing the toxicological impact of these plastics on sediment and aquatic organisms is an emerging issue, as they have been found in microalgae, brine shrimp larvae, bivalves, fish and shellfish. The amount of plastic waste in the seas is continuing to increase and part of that waste is degraded to produce microplastics and nanoplastics. Therefore, exposure to these materials will inevitably increase, resulting in an emerging food safety issue. Micro- and nanoplastics contamination might cause damage to metabolic, morphological, physiological, food uptake, and behavioral processes, and as a consequence, their impacts may be significant at both the cellular and ecosystem levels. Research output concerning the source, fate, and toxicological impact of micro- and nanoplastics on marine organisms has increased dramatically, but there are still gaps in knowledge about the molecular alterations that they cause.

Entanglement of invertebrates, sharks, turtles, birds and marine mammals is mainly caused by macroplastics (>5 mm), and leads to reduced mobility, ineffective foraging and subsequent mortality. The main plastic types associated with entanglement are improperly discarded fishing nets, lines, ropes and straps. In South Africa and surrounding waters, plastic ingestion has been reported in a number of marine species: sharks (n=10), fish (n=7), turtles (n=1) and birds (n=36). Lethal (macroplastic) and sub-lethal effects (microplastic â‰¤5 mm) of marine debris on biota have been noted, but at the time of this review there were no published reports on impacts at the population level. Consumed shellfish are possible vectors for the introduction of microplastics into humans. The specific impacts of microplastic ingestion on human health are largely unknown, but additives associated with plastics represent a threat. The research infrastructure in South Africa is insufficient to monitor and characterise marine plastic debris and, in many cases, not in line with global standards. More research effort is needed to understand the impacts of marine plastic debris on humans and marine biota in South Africa, particularly at the population level. Significance â€¢ Macroplastics affect marine biota mainly via entanglement and microplastics largely through ingestion. â€¢ Macro- and microplastic interactions with biota can result in sub-lethal effects and mortality but no population effects have been reported for South Africa. â€¢ Consumed shellfish are a potential source of microplastics for humans but their potential effects in humans remain unknown. â€¢ Better infrastructure is needed for improved monitoring and research on the effects of marine debris in South Africa.

Plastic ingestion is of special concern, as its magnitude and consequences for marine organisms and potentially humans are still largely unknown. We reviewed 93 papers on plastic ingestion by wild marine fish published since 1972. Plastic ingestion was detected in 323 (65%) of 494 examined fish species, and in 262 (67%) of 391 examined commercial fish species. These proportions are likely greater, as a detailed analysis of the sampling effort and analytical methods used in the reviewed studies suggests an underestimation of plastic ingestion in some assessments. A significant positive relationship (R = + 0.845, p = 0.004) was found between the sample size up to N = 10 and the detection of plastic ingestion. We also found significant differences in detection and frequency of occurrence (FO, %) of plastic ingestion among the three main types of analytical methods: naked-eye, microscopic analysis and chemical digestion. The chemical digestion method, which is also the most robust laboratory method, had the greatest detection (86%) and the highest FO (37.6 Â± 0.6%). To avoid the underestimation of plastic ingestion in future work, we provided recommendations for sample sizes and laboratory analysis.

Embryotoxicity parameters (survival, hatching rate, and the incidence of anatomical malformations) and behavioral patterns (locomotion during the exploration of a new environment, thigmotaxis, and the escape response to an aversive stimulus) were evaluated. Exposed embryos hatched between 48 and 72Â hpf, as expected for the species, but tendencies of either acceleration or delay were observed, depending on the nanoparticle coating. Malformations in exposed and control groups were similar, independent of the coating. Mortality rates were also not significantly affected by exposure to most of the coated SPIONs, except for animals treated with chitosan-coated nanoparticles, which induced 100% mortality at concentrations higher than 2Â mM. A similar trend was observed in the behavioral parameters, in which significant adverse effects were mostly caused by chitosan-coated nanoparticles even at low concentrations. The higher toxicity observed for chitosan-coated particles raises concern and deserves further mechanistic investigations, considering the ample use of this compound in pharmaceutical and biomedical applications.

In addition, 1296.95 trillion synthetic fiber microplastics (648.48 t) were discharged from WwTPs and 0.7885 million tons of synthetic rubber tires dust were produced in 2016. Fiber microplastics from laundry of synthetic textiles and dust from erosion of tires while driving are also important sources of land-based microplastics. By comparing the emissions of plastic debris and primary microplastics, as well as land-based waste treatment, marine litter pollution control and treatment in China with those from developed countries, China should strengthen land-based waste management by improving the 'ban on free plastic bags' and the domestic waste classification system. Also, a policy to 'limit plastic microbeads' should be implemented as soon as possible, and microplastics emissions from WwTPs should be investigated. Further countermeasures for marine litter pollution, such as formulating relevant laws and regulations and inspection and monitoring standards, need to be improved. Therefore, increase China's international influence on marine plastic debris and microplastics pollution control. Â© 2020, Editorial Board, Research of Environmental Sciences.

Lamprey are scientifically, ecologically, culturally, and economically important fishes. Our study represents the first synthesis ever on environmental contamination in lamprey. Objectives of this study include: (1) evaluate lethal and sublethal effects of environmental contaminants on lamprey, thereby providing insight into the potential for environmental contaminants to affect lamprey abundance, (2) highlight the unique characteristics of contaminant accumulation in lamprey, (3) determine whether spatial and temporal trends observed in contaminant concentrations of other top predators of aquatic food webs are reflected in the spatial and temporal trends of contaminant concentrations of lamprey, (4) identify key environmental contaminants affecting consumption advisories for people eating lamprey, and (5) identify important gaps in our knowledge of environmental contamination in lamprey. The geographic scope of this synthesis is worldwide. We conclude that, in general, the environmental contaminant concentrations that have been experienced by lamprey in the wild appear to be nonlethal to lamprey. However, environmental contaminants exert sublethal effects on lamprey. Sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) and Pacific lamprey (Entosphenus tridentatus) are relatively high in total mercury (Hg) concentration compared with other fishes. Compared with other top predators, lamprey are relatively low in polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentration and concentrations of organochlorine pesticides. We also conclude that regulations on the use of PCBs, beginning in the 1970s, were effective in dramatically reducing PCB concentration in lamprey since the 1970s. Emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals, microplastics, and per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), have yet to be studied in lamprey.

World Health Organization reported 9.6 million cancer-related deaths only in 2018 [2]. Although there have been advances in cancer therapy, the development of anti-tumor strategies faces many limitations. The main cancer-treating methodsâ€”chemotherapy and radiotherapyâ€”compromise the hostâ€™s immune system and have many other systemic side effects [3]. Recently, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted attention in cancer treatment due to its non-invasive and highly selective properties [4], [5]. The idea behind PDT is using a photosensitizer with varying affinity to malignant and normal cells resulting in different concentrations of the agent in cells. Subsequently, an appropriate wavelength light irradiation on target cells produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the photosensitizer leading to cellular damage [6]. Various photosensitizers are used in PDT. Most of them are porphyrin-based dyes with low quantum yield, little tumor targetability, high-power laser light exposure requirement, and general side effects on healthy tissue [7]. Meantime, fullerene (C60), a new class of nanocarbon molecules with 60 carbon atoms in a closed cage structure, has been introduced as an efficient and non-toxic photosensitizer [8]. Due to the unique photoproduction abilities of C60 fullerenes, they can generate singlet oxygen and other ROS (O2-, H2O2, HOâ€¢) under the influence of visible light irradiation [9]. Besides, C60 accumulates in malignant cells selectively and inhibits key enzyme systems competitively [10]. This reduces systematic side effects in the body compared to chemotherapy and other photodynamic agents [11]. However, C60 fullerenes have some limitations. For example, C60 is insoluble in polar solvents, which limits its application in biological studies. Therefore, C60 bioavailability must be enhanced by adding water-soluble functional groups [12], [13]. This study reviewed related studies since 1996 about different hydrophilic agents, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), nano-silica, carboxylic acids, human serum albumin, glycogen, polyethylene oxide, glycol chitosan, and viral nanoparticles, added to C60 to increase water solubility. We analyzed the reported results for C60 hydrophilic agent combinations that were examined in vivo or in vitro under a specific wavelength light irradiation. As a result of the cytotoxicity ability of the C60-agent combination, cell viability was used as one of our main indicators to compare PDT efficacy of various C60-agent combinations. It was found that C60 conjunctions could increase the functionality of fullerenes in treating different cancer cells. PDT efficacy is not all, and we need to focus on the side effects as well. The major challenge in cancer treatment strategies is to limit systemic side effects. For this purpose, drug delivery systems (DDSs) have been designed to destroy target cells selectively. They also control and prolong drug release by protecting the drug from degrading enzymes [14]. A DDS consists of three main parts: 1) an addressing unit to recognize selected targets, 2) a multiplying unit to increase the number of drug molecules, and 3) an active biological unit. In the second part of our review article, we explained different substances like liposome, graphene, transferrin, pullulan, etc. as drug delivery agents added to C60 to maximize its therapeutic effects and minimize its side effects spontaneously [15]. In conclusion, drug delivery systems using C60 showed a strong anti-tumor efficacy compared to free drugs under irradiation. In the last part of this study, we investigated the application of porphyrin-C60 and chlorine-C60 dyads in PDT to enhance ROS production in PDT. Recently, porphyrins, phthalocyanines, and chlorines have been recommended as therapeutic properties in PDT. Based on recent studies, we evaluated the functionality of porphyrin-C60 and chlorine-C60 dyads for producing long-lived radical ion pairs under irradiation, which makes these combinations very efficient sensitizers for PDT [16]. Finally, the combination could reduce cell viability significantly under light irradiation. In this study, for the first time, we explored the capability of C60 fullerenes as effective photosensitizers and revealed their cons and prose for treating cancer diseases. Results will be useable for a broad audience, from engineers to medical researchers, to chemically modify fullerene and apply it as a cancer treatment photodynamic agent. Â© 2020, Avestia Publishing.

The effects of microplastic ingestion on some marine biota have been evaluated, but the uptake, elimination, and histopathological impacts of microplastics remain under-investigated especially for zooplankton larvae. Here, we show that 10 Î¼m polystyrene microspheres can be ingested and egested by Artemia parthenogenetica larvae, which impact their health. The results indicate that A. parthenogenetica larvae have a varying capacity to consume 10 Î¼m polystyrene microspheres that is dependent on microplastic exposure concentrations, exposure times, and the availability of food. The lowest level of microplastics that was ingested by A. parthenogenetica was 0.15 particles/individual when exposed to 10 particles/mL and 0.05 particles/individual when exposed to 1 particle/mL over 24 h and 14 d, respectively. A. parthenogenetica larvae were able to egest feces with microplastics within 3 h of ingestion. However, ingested microplastics persisted in individuals for up to 14 days. Furthermore, microalgal feeding was significantly reduced by 27.2% in the presence of 102 particles/mL microplastics over 24 h. Histological analyses indicated that a greater abundance of lipid droplets was present among epithelia after 24 h of exposure at a concentration of 10 particles/mL. Moreover, intestinal epithelia were deformed and disorderedly arranged after 14 d of exposure. Overall, these results indicate that marine microplastic pollution could pose a threat to A. parthenogenetica health, especially that of larvae. Consequently, further research is required to evaluate the potential physiological and histopathological effects of microplastics for other marine invertebrate species.

Objective: To analyze the microplastic content of Baronang Fish and Snapper Fish in the Coastal of Bangkala Subdistrict. Method: The method used is the analytical survey, laboratory approach with Minitab software 16. Fish samples were identified using FishBase. The obtained microscopy was calculated based on number and type, photographed with optilab, and measured by raster image software. Results: The microplastic content of Snapper Fish is higher than that of Baronang Fish at each station. The microplastic content of Snapper Fish at Station 1 is 18 particles/fish while Baronang Fish is 14 particles/ fish. The microplastic content of Snapper Fish at Station 2 is 18 particles/fish while Baronang Fish is 13 particles/fish. The microplastic content of Snapper at station 3 is ten particles/fish while Baronang Fish is six particles/fish. This happens because Snapper Fish has more prominent characteristics than Baronang Fish, including having faster growth, having excessive eating behavior, tolerant of turbidity and salinity and more actively moving. Based on these characteristics, the chances of microplastic entering the body of Snapper Fish through eating activities are greater than that of Baronang Fish. The largest type of microplastic fiber is found in the digestive tract of Snapper and Baronang Fish. Conclusion: Baronang and Snapper Fish originated from Bangkala Subdistrict Beach, Jeneponto Regency containing microplastic. The microplastic content of Snapper Fish is greater than that of Baronang Fish. Â© 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Materials and Methods: In the present interventional animal study, 12 male New Zealand rabbits were tested. In the parietal bone of the rabbits, 24 defects were prepared (2 defects for each rabbit), which were divided into 3 equal groups (Cy, PCL, and control). Each rabbit's calvarial bone was prepared for the histologic and histomorphometric survey. The amount of regenerated bone (ie, length, area, percentage), necrosis rate, fibrosis (fibrosis plus and percentage), and inflammation in the standard defects of parietal bone in the rabbits were examined and compared after 10 weeks. Results: A significant difference was found between the Cy and PCL groups regarding the mean area and thickness of the bone. We also found a significant difference in the bone length, area, and percentage formed between PCL and control groups. Also, the rate of fibrous tissue formation was significantly different statistically between the PCL and control groups. The results showed the influence of the PCL membrane in generating more bone and less fibrous tissue. In all 3 groups, negligible inflammation and no necrosis was observed. Conclusions: The results of the present study have shown that combining PCL, PEG, and BGs could be promising for bone regeneration in jaw defects, around dental implants, and in oral and maxillofacial defects.

The five main categories of marine debris comprise of plastic, paper, metal, textile, glass and rubber. Plastics is recognised as the major constituent of marine debris, representing between 50% and 90% of the total marine debris found globally. Between 4.8 and 12.7 million metric tonnes of consumer plastics end up in the world oceans annually, resulting in the presence of more than 100 million particles of macroplastics in only 12 regional seas worldwide, and with 51 trillion particles of microplastic floating on the ocean surface globally. The impacts of marine debris can be branched out into three categories; injury to or death of marine organisms, harm to marine environment and effects on human health and economy. Marine mammals often accidentally ingest marine debris because of its appearance that can easily be mistaken as food. Moreover, floating plastics may act as vehicles for chemicals and/or environmental contaminants, which may be absorbed on to their surface during their use and permanence into the environment. Additionally, floating plastics is a potential vector for the introduction of invasive species that get attached to it, into the marine environment. In addition, human beings are not excluded from the impact of marine debris as they become exposed to microplastics through seafood consumption. Moreover, landscape degradation owing to debris accumulation is an eyesore and aesthetically unpleasant, thus resulting in decreased tourism and subsequent income loss. There are a wide range of initiatives that have been taken to tackle the issue of marine debris. They may involve manual removal of marine debris from coastal and aquatic environment in form of programmes and projects organised, such as beach clean-ups by scientific communities, non-governmental organizations and the removal of marine litter from Europeâ€™s four regional seas, respectively. Other initiatives focus on assessment, reduction, prevention and management of marine debris under the umbrella of international (the United Nations Environment Programme/Mediterranean Action Plan, the Oslo/Paris Convention) and regional organisations â€“ that is, the Helsinki Commission. There are also a number of international conventions and national regulations that encourage mitigation and management of marine debris. However, it is argued that these initiatives are short-term unsustainable solutions and the long-term sustainable solution would be adoption of circular economy. Similarly, four of the sustainable developmental goals have targets that promote mitigation of marine debris by efficient waste management and practice of 3R. As evident by the Ad Hoc Expert Group on Marine Litter and Microplastics meeting, tackling the marine debris crisis is not a straightforward, one-size-fits-all solution, but rather an integrated and continuous effort required at local, regional and global level.

Plastics rarely biodegrade but through different processes they fragment into microplastics and nanoplastics, which have been reported as ubiquitous pollutants in all marine environments worldwide. This study is a review of trend in marine plastic pollution with focus on the current toxicological consequences. Microplastics are capable of absorbing organic contaminants, metals and pathogens from the environment into organisms. This exacerbates its toxicological profile as they interact to induced greater toxic effects. Early studies focused on the accumulation of plastics in the marine environment, entanglement of and ingestions by marine vertebrates, with seabirds used as bioindicators. Entanglement in plastic debris increases asphyxiation through drowning, restrict feeding but increases starvation, skin abrasions and skeletal injuries. Plastic ingestion causes blockage of the guts which may cause injury of the gut lining, morbidity and mortality. Small sizes of the microplastics enhance their translocation across the gastro-intestinal membranes via endocytosis-like mechanisms and distribution into tissues and organs. While in biological systems, microplastics increase dysregulation of gene expression required for the control of oxidative stress and activating the expression of nuclear factor E2-related factor (Nrf) signaling pathway in marine vertebrates and invertebrates. These alterations are responsible for microplastics induction of oxidative stress, immunological responses, genomic instability, disruption of endocrine system, neurotoxicity, reproductive abnormities, embryotoxicity and trans-generational toxicity. It is possible that the toxicological effects of microplastics will continue beyond 2020 the timeline for its ending by world environmental groups. Considering that most countries in African and Asia (major contributors of global plastic pollutions) are yet to come to terms with the enormity of microplastic pollution. Hence, majority of countries from these regions are yet to reduce, re-use or re-circle plastic materials to enhance its abatement.

This study revealed the presence of microplastics in the digestive tract of 9 commercial species collected from six sites along the Pantai Indah Kapuk coast. Ingested microplastics were identified using gut content analysis. Microplastic particles were counted and categorized by type, color, and size. 169 of 174 (97.13%) of examined fish had microplastics. A total of 2063 microplastic particles were collected with the average number of particles per individual of 12.21 Â± 9.76. The highest number (20.0 Â± 8.0 particles individual- 1 ) was found in Sardinella fimbriata and the lowest one (4.9 Â± 4.7 particles individual -1 ) was found in Oreochromis mossambicus. Majority of ingested particles were fibers (89.63%), followed by fragments (6.24%), films (4.13%) and no pellets were observed. In terms of color, the most abundant were transparent particles (79.20%), followed by blue (7.03%), red (3.54%), black (2.86%), green (2.71%), and others which were found in low number. The highest number of fibers by size was &lt;20-100 Âµm (55.03%), films were 100-1000 Âµm (33.93%), and fragments were &lt;100 Âµm (25.25%).

A neuston net called CetoRhiNet was used for sampling, towed as far as 1 nautical mile at the speed of 1 knot. P. canius digestive tracts were soaked H 2 O 2 ,and the microplastics were separated using using ZnCl 2 based on their density prior for analysisunder a light microscope. The results showed the amount of mesoplastic from Tanjungpinang water from 3 stations i.e. Sei Jang, Teluk Keriting and Pelantar KUD were 4.98 piece/m 3 , 4.13 piece/m 3 and 6.87 piece/m 3 respectively. Concerning microplastics in P. canius, 14 of 15 fish were contaminated with plastic in the tail. Based on the selectivity index calculation, P. canius has no preference on plastics when ingested their feed. Our finding suggested that plastic particles enter accidentally via natural feed because plastic waste particles are scattered throughout Tanjungpinang waters.

The â€œuse and disposeâ€ attitude of the public towards plastics coupled with inadequate waste management has led to extensive accumulation of plastic debris in the aquatic environment. Microplastics (plastic particles of <5mm in their longest dimension) in the aquatic environment and fish gut is an emerging concern that has been reported from different regions of the world. The degradation of plastic polymers to micro- and even to nano sized particles smaller than 100 nm size is of recent major concern. Micro- and nanoplastics are basically inert but they tend to sorb toxic pollutants and harmful microorganisms. Moreover, chemicals added to plastic to impart functional properties pose threat to human health. Fish, either by passive ingestion or active foraging accumulate microplastics in their guts. However, there is paucity of documented evidence on the adverse effect of microplastics on human health due to consumption of such fish. Protocol for the determination of quantity of microplastics in fish flesh needs to be standardised and quality standard to be fixed for the quantity of microplastics that would be considered as a food hazard. There exists an imminent need to perform risk analysis in order to categorise microplastic as a food hazard in fish meant for human consumption. Until then there is no justification to reduce the consumption of fish and fishery products due to apprehension of presence of microplastics. Â© 2019, Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

Waste is a major problem for marine organisms, causing entanglement, choking, strangulation, malnutrition and death. In 1972 the problems caused by microplastics, particles smaller than 5 mm, were first observed. Such particles bind pathogenic microorganisms on to their surface. Increasing quantities of microplastics have been found in the stomachs of fish, and also in shellfish that feed by filtering sea water. Ingested by marine organisms, such plastics may eventually pass through the food web and can end up ingested by humans. In addition, plastic releases chemical compounds whose effect on marine organisms and humans has still not been studied.

More information is required on the effects of acute and long-term exposure of fish, shellfish and humans to harmful marine toxins and the presence of other adulterants such as viruses, bacteria, pharmaceuticals, microplastics, microfibers and industrial chemicals. Humans can be affected by the presence of marine contaminants due to working in close proximity with fish, consuming fish or swimming in contaminated water.

On 2018, the public were shocked by the results of research done by the University of New York, United States, which announced that microplastic components were found in bottled mineral water from the brands Aqua, Nestle, and Club. Then, at the end of 2018, worm parasites were found in canned mackerel fish.

Sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) is frequently-used as antibiotics in aquaculture. However, the effect of micro-plastics on SMZ residues in tilapia muscle is un-clear. The micro-plastics and sulfamethoxazole dosage in fishponds have been manipulated based on the ambient concentration, and the application of sulfonamides in aquaculture specified by SC/T 1084-2006. Three concentrations including: zero (NP), low (LP) and high (HP) micro-plastics in fishponds; and four doses of SMZ [zero (NS), low (LS), medium (MS) and high (HS)] in forages were fabricated. For understanding the effect of micro-plastics on SMZ residues in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) muscle, an 8-weeks breeding experiment was conducted. Tilapia was fed in the first four weeks on a SMZ diet, followed by non SMZ diet for the next four weeks. SMZ content in fish meat was determined during the fourth, sixth and eighth weeks. The fourth weekâ€™s results of SMZ residue in fish meat reveal that environmental micro-plastics could significantly reduce the residual value of SMZ in fish-meat. Single factor analysis of variance for the residual value of SMZ in fish meat at the 4th, 6th and 8th weeks, reveal that after the 4th week, all micro-plastic exposure groups at different SMZ dosage diets were significantly lower than those in the non-micro-plastic groups (P&lt;0.05), and there was no significant differences between the micro-plastic concentrations (P&gt;0.05). After the 6th week, only HP and NP groups with MS diet had significant differences (P&lt;0.05), and no significant difference was found in other SMZ feed groups of different micro-plastic treatments (P&gt;0.05). Similarly, the results from the 8th week, show that there was no significant difference in all groups fed on SMZ diet for the different micro-plastics treatments (P&gt;0.05). In conclusion, the findings indicate that the effect of micro-plastics on sulfamethoxazole residues in fish-meat is limited by sulfamethoxazole dosage. Â© 2018, China Environmental Science Press.

Millions of species have been, and are still being discovered in the world's oceans. Among these zooplankton serve as secondary producers and are significant as they form pelagic food links and act as indicators of water masses. They constitute the largest and most reliable source of protein for most of the ocean's fishes. As such, their absence or depletion often affects fishery. In many countries, the decline in fishery has been attributed to reduced plankton populations. Furthermore, trillions of tiny copepods produce countless faecal pellets contributing greatly to the marine snow and therefore accelerating the flow of nutrients and minerals from the surface waters to the seabed. They are phylogenetically highly successful groups in terms of phylogenetic age, number of living species and success of adaptive radiation. A study of the basic and applied aspects of zooplankton would provide an index of the fishery potential and applications, offering insights into ocean ecology to safeguard food supplies and livelihoods of the millions of people living in coastal areas. For this reason, we need to understand all the facets of zooplankton as well as their interactions with atmosphere and other life forms, including human. In this context, this book discusses the basic and applied aspects of zooplankton, especially taxonomy, mosquitocidal activity, culture, analysis of nutritional, pigments and enzyme profile, preservation of copepods eggs, bioenrichment of zooplankton and application of zooplankton in sustainable aquaculture production, focusing on novel biofloc-copefloc technologies, and the impact of acidification and microplastics on zooplankton. Offering a comprehensive overview of the current issues and developments in the field of environmental and commercial applications, this book is a valuable resource for researchers, aquaculturists, environmental mangers wanting to understand the importance of zooplankton and develop technologies for the sustainable production of fish and other commodities to provide food and livelihoods for mankind.

Although effects on organisms from marine plastic litter ingestion have been investigated in several oceanic areas, there is still a lack of information from the Mediterranean Sea. The main objectives of this paper are to review current knowledge on the impact of marine litter on Mediterranean biodiversity, to define selection criteria for choosing marine organisms suitable for use as bioindicator species, and to propose a methodological approach to assessing the harm related to marine litter ingestion in several Mediterranean habitats and sub-regions. A new integrated monitoring tool that would provide the information necessary to design and implement future mitigation actions in the Mediterranean basin is proposed. According to bibliographic research and statistical analysis on current knowledge of marine litter ingestion, the area of the Mediterranean most studied, in terms of number of species and papers in the Mediterranean Sea is the western sub-area as well as demersal (32.9%) and pelagic (27.7%) amongst habitats. Applying ecological and biological criteria to the most threatened species obtained by statistical analysis, bioindicator species for different habitats and monitoring scale were selected. A threefold approach, simultaneously measuring the presence and effects of plastic, can provide the actual harm and sub-lethal effects to organisms caused by marine litter ingestion. The research revealed gaps in knowledge, and this paper suggests measures to close the gap. This and the selection of appropriate bioindicator species would represent a step forward for marine litter risk assessment, and the implementation of future actions and mitigation measures for specific Mediterranean areas, habitats and species affected by marine litter ingestion. Selection of suitable bioindicators of marine litter ingestion and the simultaneous quantification of its presence and ecotoxicological effects is recommended in order to monitor the impact on Mediterranean fauna and habitats.

Nanoplastics can have a bigger capacity to concentrate toxic compounds either associated with its production or sorbed from the environment has not been extensively evaluated. Indications suggest that nanoplastics carry more toxics than microplatics (more than million times than seawater). These nanoplastics can also carry microorganisms. There is no harmonization of methodologies for sampling and analysis of micro(nanoplastics) and there are limits in the accuracy of sizes of these particles that can be detected.

Although CO2 laser engraving is an efficient method for thermoplastic device fabrication, it accompanies with poor bonding issues due to severe bulging and large feature size determined by the diameter of laser beam. In this study, a low-cost microfabrication method is proposed by reversibly sealing a 1 mm thick polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) over an engraving substrate to reduce channel feature size and minimize bulges of laser engraved channels. PMMA, polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA), cyclic-olefin polymers (COP) and polylactic acid (PLA) were found compatible with this sacrificial layer assisted laser engraving technique. Microchannel width as small as âˆ¼40 Î¼m was attainable by a laser beam that was 5 times larger in diameter. Bulging height was significantly reduced to less 5 Î¼m for most substrates, which facilitated leak proof device bonding without channel deformation. Microdevices with high aspect ratio channels were prepared to demonstrate the applicability of this microfabrication method. We believe this fast and low-cost fabrication approach for thermoplastics will be of interest to researchers who have encountered problem with polydimethylsiloxane based microdevices in their applications.

There have been concerns about the environmental exposure and their toxic effect to organisms such as fish. Studies have quantified the release of silver from various products including textiles and plastics that use silver as an antibacterial agent, yet there is no unified standard for the measurement of silver release. Additionally, there is limited information about the release of silver from glass surfaces coated with silver nanoparticles. While immobilizing silver to substrates will ultimately reduce environmental exposure, deliberately controlling silver release will also reduce the amount of silver released into the environment. In this study, silver nanoparticles were synthesized and deposited onto glass using an aerosol pyrolysis process, i.e. the Liquid Flame Spray. The deposited silver nanoparticles were further coated with a thin layer of aluminum oxide that was fabricated by atomic layer deposition. The leaching of silver from the coated glass was measured in water over a period of six days. The results show that a 15 nm thin layer of aluminum oxide is able to inhibit the release of silver up to 48 h, thereby providing a way to control the release of silver in time.

Currently, plastics are the most abundant items in marine debris and the most frequently reported materials encountered by marine organisms (Thompson et al., 2009; CBD, 2012). Over 80% of the adverse impacts of marine debris on marine species are associated with plastic debris (CBD, 2012). There is growing concern over marine plastic debris because of the increased bioavailability of their breakdown products, including microplastics. As larger pieces of plastic debris become smaller through environmental weathering and degradation processes, their potential encounters with or ingestion by marine animals could greatly expand from large marine animals (e.g., marine mammals, sea turtles, and seabirds) to small marine species (e.g., zooplankton, crustaceans, bivalves, polychaetes, and fish). It is well known that entanglement and ingestion of plastic debris have adverse physical effects on marine life, such as internal and/or external abrasions and blockage of digestive organs, which results in satiation, starvation, and physical deterioration. The chemical hazards of plastic debris have recently attracted attention from scientists. Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Regulations in many counties/regions have been setup or to be implemented to ban the production/sale and use of primary microplastics (e.g., microbeads), which could reduce microplastics in the aquatic environment in certain level. However, the fragments from larger plastic items (second microplastics) are major contributors, and then new legislations have to be proposed and implemented in order to substantially reduce the amounts of microplastics in the environment and the associated environmental impact. Moreover, approaches and measures are to be taken by encouraging companies and all users to adopt the Reduceâ€“Reuseâ€“Recycle circular economy as this will represent a cost-effective way of reducing the quantity of plastic objects and microplastics particles entering and gathering in the marine/aquatic environment.

Different than the conventional multiphoton excitation process, upconversion can be efficiently performed at low excitation densities. Recent developments in lanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have led to a diversity of applications, including detecting and sensing of biomolecules, imaging of live cells, tissues and animals, cancer diagnostic and therapy, etc. Measuring the upconversion lifetime provides a new dimension of its imaging and opens a new window for its applications. Due to the long metastable intermediate excited state, UCNP typically has a long excited state lifetime ranging from sub-microseconds to milliseconds. Here, we present a novel development using the FastFLIM technique to measure UCNP lifetime by laser scanning confocal microscopy. FastFLIM is capable of measuring lifetime from 100 ps to 100 ms and features the high data collection efficiency (up to 140-million counts per second). Other than the traditional nonlinear least-square fitting analysis, the raw data acquired by FastFLIM can be directly processed by the model-free phasor plots approach for instant and unbiased lifetime results, providing the ideal routine for the UCNP photoluminescence lifetime microscopy imaging.

Multiple efforts have been made to identify and isolate microorganisms capable of utilizing synthetic polymers and recent results point towards the viability of a solution for this problem based on the biodegradation of plastics resorting to selected microbial strains. Herein, the response of the fungus Zalerion maritimum to different times of exposition to polyethylene (PE) pellets, in a minimum growth medium, was evaluated, based on the quantified mass differences in both the fungus and the microplastic pellets used. Additionally, molecular changes were assessed through attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Results showed that, under the tested conditions, Z. maritimum is capable of utilizing PE, resulting in the decrease, in both mass and size, of the pellets.

They support livelihoods through marine and coastal industries such as fishing, aquaculture, energy extraction and tourism. They provide spaces for recreation, play and relaxation. For the many of us who live at the coasts, the marine environment provides a sense of place and identity. Indeed, in some locations, particularly small island nations, our seas and coasts define cultures and cultural practices such as â€˜pearlingâ€™ (the traditional sea use of harvesting pearls from oyster beds in Bahrain) have even been entered into the World Heritage List. However, our oceans and coasts face many challenges (UNEP/GPA 2006). The Deepwater Horizon-BP oil spill is a stark reminder of the dependence of coastal communities on healthy seas. Considered the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry, the spill led to extensive damage to the marine environment as well as impacts on other marine industries such as fishing and tourism. Oil spills are but one threat to the marine environment. In 1992, the Canadian Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, John Crosbie, declared a moratorium on the northern Cod fishery after six Canadian populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) collapsed largely due to overexploitation. In 2011, 28.8 per cent of fish stocks were estimated as overfished (FAO 2014) which causes negative ecological consequences as well as leading to reductions in fish production, with negative social and economic consequences. Dredging and trawling also has major impacts on the ecological communities of the sea floor. Other problems include rising levels of micro-plastics and waste detritus in general, water quality issues such as the impacts of agricultural fertiliser and pesticide runoff, the dumping of toxic wastes in the deep sea and the introduction of non-native species. On top of these sea levels are rising, oceans are becoming more acidic and sea currents are changing as a result of climate change. The need for improved stewardship of coastal and marine resources is increasingly evident around the globe. But what is marine stewardship and how can we apply stewardship in these environments?.

Moreover, silica nanoparticle (SNP) was embedded to improve the performance of HPAM/PEI gel. To achieve the optimum formulation of HPAM/PEI-SNP gel, a comprehensive investigation was first conducted with the respect of gelation time, gel strength, and thermal stability. In addition, the particle size of SNP was determined by Dynamic Light Scatter (DLS) and the microstructure of HPAM/ PEI-SNP gel was characterized via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The optimum formulation, containing the polymer/crosslinker ratio of 10,000-2,000 using high molecular weight HPAM (10-15 million Dalton) with a low hydrolysis degree of 3-7%, was obtained. Given the compatibility of comparability of SNP and formation water, LS nano silica with an SNP concentration of 30 wt% was selected as hybrid resource. The results indicated that the gelation time of novel gel system was prolonged to 132 hours attributed to the introducing of nanomaterial. Taking advantage of nano-composite, the strength of HPAM/PEI-SNP gel maintained as Grade G for 312 h. Furthermore, the HPAM/PEI-SNP gel exhibited an excellent thermal stability at 85 Â°C for 660 hours without syneresis. Subsequently, SEM images confirmed the successful incorporation of SNP in the 3-dimentional network of hydrogel, supporting an effective surface modification. This work demonstrated that the novel environmentally benign HPAM/PEI-SNP gel system can be used as a potential plugging agent for the conformance improvement in high temperature high salinity reservoirs.

No differences were found between sexes, seasons, class size or infection by the rhizocephalan Heterosaccus dollfusi. Size differences were noted between crabs collected at different depths, with larger specimens at shallower sites, as well as significant interaction between sex and infection factors, with males more parasitized than females. Sex has had no bearing on food items. No significant impacts were observed of seasons, depth, class size, sex and infection on stomach fullness. Charybdis longicollis is benthophagic, with preference for infaunal and slow moving prey, as attested by the notable amount of sediment in their stomachs; the most frequent food items were molluscs, crustaceans and fish, similar to congeners. Microplastics were detected in a quarter of the specimens examined. Since the species is extremely abundant in the Levantine littoral and sublittoral, it is likely to impact the local biota.

Studies have demonstrated the ability of the anatase crystal of TiO2 NP to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), a co-exposure likely to occur in aquatic ecosystems. The goal of this study was to examine the photo-induced toxicity of anatase TiO2 NP under natural sunlight to Daphnia magna. D. magna were exposed to a range of UVR intensities and anatase TiO2 concentrations in an outdoor exposure system using the sun as the source of UVR. Different UVR intensities were achieved using UVR opaque and transparent plastics. AnataseTiO2-NP demonstrated the reciprocal relationship seen in other phototoxic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at higher UVR treatments. The calculated 8h LC50 of anatase TiO2 NP was 139ppb under full intensity ambient natural sunlight, 778ppb under 50% natural sunlight, and &gt;500ppm under 10% natural sunlight. Mortality was also compared between animals allowed to accumulate a body burden of anatase TiO2 for 1h and organisms whose first exposure to anatase TiO2 aqueous suspensions occurred under UVR. A significantly greater toxic effect was observed in aqueous, low body burden suspensions than that of TiO2 1h body burdens, which is dissimilar from the model presented in PAHs. Anatase TiO2 presents a unique photo-induced toxic model that is different than that of established phototoxic compounds.

It is important to understand their distribution in the marine environment and their implications on marine habitats and marine biota. Microplastics have been found in almost every marine habitat around the world, with plastic composition and environmental conditions significantly affecting their distribution. Marine biota interact with microplastics including birds, fish, turtles, mammals and invertebrates. The biological repercussions depend on to the size of microplastics encountered, with smaller sizes having greater effects on organisms at the cellular level. In the micrometre range plastics are readily ingested and egested, whereas nanometre-sized plastics can pass through cell membranes. Despite concerns raised by ingestion, the effects of microplastic ingestion in natural populations and the implications for food webs are not understood. Without knowledge of retention and egestion rates of field populations, it is difficult to deduce ecological consequences. There is evidence to suggest that microplastics enter food chains and there is trophic transfer between predators and prey. What is clear is that further research on a variety of marine organisms is required to understand the environmental implications of microplastics in more detail and to establish effects in natural populations.

This will bring them in contact with red and white blood cells of the blood stream before they reach their main target, the cancer cells. However, possible cyto- and/or genotoxic effects of GNPs on lymphocytes are not known in detail and are thus studied here. Cytotoxicity was determined by Trypan blue exclusion assay. For genotoxicity, Comet and Comet-FISH (=fluorescence in situ hybridization) assays were done. In the latter test two gene markers for DNA damage, TP53 as tumor suppressor gene and TNF-Î± as tumor necrosis factor gene, were investigated. The cells were incubated in the presence of different concentrations of polyethylene glycol-coated rod-shaped GNPs of 50 nm or 30 nm in diameter. GNPs induced cytotoxic effects in human lymphocytes. The effects could be observed in concentration- and size-dependent manner; 30 nm sized GNPs were more toxic than 50 nm sized ones. Using the comet assay, it was demonstrated that GNPs induce high rates of DNA damage, which are represented e.g. as high ratios of tail moments, compared to non-treated lymphocytes. The target genes (TP53 and TNF-Î±) were observed preferentially in comet tails indicating high rates of induced DNA damage in this DNA area. Our results suggest that rod-shaped GNPs interact with human blood lymphocytes, reduce cell viability and cause relevant DNA damage in a concentration dependent manner. The small sized GNPs were more cyto- and genotoxic than big sized GNPs. The low concentration of big sized rod-shaped GNPs could be safe for cancer photothermal therapy rather than small rod GNPs. However, further investigations are recommended to be able to minimize potential risks of application.

Early detection can decrease mortality rates from more than 20% to less than 1% and the relevant early diagnosis analyte is the viral non-structural glycoprotein, NS1. Currently, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the method of choice to detect NS1. However, this is a time consuming method, requiring 3-5. h, and it is the bottleneck for routine of clinical analysis laboratory in epidemic periods, when hundreds of samples should be tested. Here we describe an easy method combining principles of fluorophore linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA) and enzyme linked immunospotting (ELISPOT). For detection, we used mouse anti-NS1 IgG labeled with fluorescent nanoparticles. The presented procedure needs only 4 Î¼L of serum samples and requires 45-60. min. The detection limit, 5.2. ng/mL, is comparable to ELISA tests. The comparison of 83 samples with a commercial ELISA revealed a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 88%. The use of fluorescent nanoparticles provides a higher sensitivity than an assay using usual fluorescent dye molecules, besides avoiding bleaching effects. Based on the results, the proposed method provides fast, specific and sensitive results, and proves to be a suitable method for Dengue NS1 detection in impoverished regions or epidemic areas.

The SPMNP probe was prepared by coupling monoclonal antibodies against allergen Pa onto the surface of SPMNP. Dispersibility of the obtained SPMNP probe was analyzed. Nitrocellulose membrane and test line coating concentration were optimized to construct the lateral flow system. Results showed that Sartorius CN 140 membrane, 0.8 mg/mL Pa was suitable for strip construction. Furthermore, a calibration curve with good linearity (R 2 = 0.9949) was obtained by plotting magnetic signals against series concentrations of Pa. Signals of the T-line were linear in the range from 0.01 to 100 Î¼g/mL Pa. LODs for qualitative and quantitative detection were 5 Î¼g/mL and 0.046 Î¼g/mL, respectively. The average recoveries in clam and peanut matrices ranged from 84.6% to 97.0%, within an acceptable level (80%-120%). 29 food extract samples were separately tested by LFIA and Western Blot assay. Comparative results indicated that the relative consistency between the two methods was 93.1% (27/29). On the other hand, the magnetic signal analysis results indicated that the detection time of the LFIA method was less than 20 min while Western Blot assay typically takes about 5 h. In conclusion, the LFIA method based on SPMNP probe for allergen Pa detection is rapid, specific and simple. It would significantly improve efficiency for large-scale screening and point-of-care detections of allergen Pa.

One aspect is the influence that microplastic may have on enhancing the transport and bioavailability of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic substances (PBT). In this study we assess these potential risks using a thermodynamic approach, aiming to prioritize the physicochemical properties of chemicals that are most likely absorbed by microplastic and therefore ingested by biota. Using a multimedia modeling approach, we define a chemical space aimed at improving our understanding of how chemicals partition in the marine environment with varying volume ratios of air/water/organic carbon/polyethylene, where polyethylene represents a main group of microplastic. Results suggest that chemicals with log KOW &gt; 5 have the potential to partition &gt;1% to polyethylene. Food-web model results suggest that reductions in body burden concentrations for nonpolar organic chemicals are likely to occur for chemicals with log KOW between 5.5 and 6.5. Thus the relative importance of microplastic as a vector of PBT substances to biological organisms is likely of limited importance, relative to other exposure pathways. Nevertheless, a number of data-gaps are identified, largely associated with improving our understanding of the physical fate of microplastic in the environment.

One critical requirement during cancer progression is angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels. Structural and functional imaging of tumor vasculature has been studied using various imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound. Molecular imaging, a key component of the 21st-century cancer-patient management strategy, takes advantage of these traditional imaging techniques and introduces molecular probes to determine the expression of indicative molecular markers at different stages of cancer development. In this chapter, we will focus on two tumor vasculature-related targets: integrin Î±vÎ²3 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). For imaging of integrin Î±vÎ²3 on the tumor vasculature, only nanoparticle-based probes will be discussed. VEGFR imaging will be discussed in depth, and we will give a detailed example of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of VEGFR expression using radio-labeled VEGF121 protein. Future clinical translation will be critical for maximum patient benefit from these agents. To achieve this goal, multidisciplinary approaches and cooperative efforts from many individuals, institutions, industries, and organizations are needed to quickly translate multimodality tumor vasculature imaging into multiple facets of cancer patient management.

However, in the last two decades of the 20th Century, the deposition rate accelerated past the rate of production, and plastics are now one of the most common and persistent pollutants in ocean waters and beaches worldwide. Thirty years ago the prevailing attitude of the plastic industry was that ""plastic litter is a very small proportion of all litter and causes no harm to the environment except as an eyesore"" [Derraik, J.G.B., 2002. The pollution of the marine environment by plastic debris: a review. Mar. Pollut. Bull. 44(9), 842-852]. Between 1960 and 2000, the world production of plastic resins increased 25-fold, while recovery of the material remained below 5%. Between 1970 and 2003, plastics became the fastest growing segment of the US municipal waste stream, increasing nine-fold, and marine litter is now 60-80% plastic, reaching 90-95% in some areas. While undoubtedly still an eyesore, plastic debris today is having significant harmful effects on marine biota. Albatross, fulmars, shearwaters and petrels mistake floating plastics for food, and many individuals of these species are affected; in fact, 44% of all seabird species are known to ingest plastic. Sea turtles ingest plastic bags, fishing line and other plastics, as do 26 species of cetaceans. In all, 267 species of marine organisms worldwide are known to have been affected by plastic debris, a number that will increase as smaller organisms are assessed. The number of fish, birds, and mammals that succumb each year to derelict fishing nets and lines in which they become entangled cannot be reliably known; but estimates are in the millions. We divide marine plastic debris into two categories: macro, >5 mm and micro, <5 mm. While macro-debris may sometimes be traced to its origin by object identification or markings, micro-debris, consisting of particles of two main varieties, (1) fragments broken from larger objects, and (2) resin pellets and powders, the basic thermoplastic industry feedstocks, are difficult to trace. Ingestion of plastic micro-debris by filter feeders at the base of the food web is known to occur, but has not been quantified. Ingestion of degraded plastic pellets and fragments raises toxicity concerns, since plastics are known to adsorb hydrophobic pollutants. The potential bioavailability of compounds added to plastics at the time of manufacture, as well as those adsorbed from the environment are complex issues that merit more widespread investigation. The physiological effects of any bioavailable compounds desorbed from plastics by marine biota are being directly investigated, since it was found 20 years ago that the mass of ingested plastic in Great Shearwaters was positively correlated with PCBs in their fat and eggs. Colonization of plastic marine debris by sessile organisms provides a vector for transport of alien species in the ocean environment and may threaten marine biodiversity. There is also potential danger to marine ecosystems from the accumulation of plastic debris on the sea floor. The accumulation of such debris can inhibit gas exchange between the overlying waters and the pore waters of the sediments, and disrupt or smother inhabitants of the benthos. The extent of this problem and its effects have recently begun to be investigated. A little more than half of all thermoplastics will sink in seawater. Â© 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Rabbits in group 1, 2, 3 and 4 received intravitreal injection of the PNIPAAm-PEO nanoparticles at different dosage respectively, which are 1mg/0. 1mL, 2mg/0.1mL, 3mg/0.1mL, and 4mg/0.1mL. Rabbits in group 5 as controls received intravitreal injection of sterilized water 0.1mL. After intravitreal injections, the eyes were examined by slit-lamp microscope, ophthalmoscopy, light microscope and some also by transmission electronic microscope. To all eyes, ERG was recorded. While these diluent at different concentration were also used as eye dropping locally in order to observe the stimulation of ocular tissue in rabbits. â€¢ Results: The rabbit ocular surface showed no signs of inflammation or alteration after different dosage PNIPAAm-PEO exposure compared with the controls. No evidence of toxicity was found in rabbits' eyes after intravitreal injections of the PNIPAAm-PEO nanoparticles at 1mg/0.1mL and 2mg/0.1mL, but intravitreal injections at 3mg/0.1mL and 4mg/0.1mL induced toxic effects on the retinas, which could make the b-wave of ERG diminished, and mainly showed extensive vacuolar degeneration in histopathology. In group 3, changes in retina were observed by light microscope from 3 to 14 days, but electron microscope changes were more observable. However, obvious changes of all of examinations were found in group 4 in the whole 14 days, when the decline rates of b-wave of ERG were above 30%. â€¢ Conclusion: The PNIPAAm-PEO nanoparticles are well tolerated by the ocular surface tissues. They can reduce retina toxicity at the dosage of more than 3mg/0.1mL in vitreous. So these facts add further support for the potential use of the PNIPAAm-PEO nanoparticles for ocular drug delivery, and ocular safety problems should be paid more attention to while the large dose intravitreal injections.","Cited By :1 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

We analyzed a polypropylene mesh coated with nanocrystalline silver particles (NCSP) as a means of preventing such infections. Methods: Nanocrystalline silver was applied to polypropylene mesh using physical vapor deposition in three doses: low (0.31 mg/cm 2), medium (0.64 mg/cm 2), and high (1.13 mg/cm 2). The zone of inhibition (ZOI) test was conducted by incubating either uncoated polypropylene mesh (UM) or silver-coated mesh (CM) with and without various amounts of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then on agar plates with Staphylococcus aureus and calculating the ZOI. The bactericidal effects of the NCSP-coated meshes were assessed by incubating either UM or CM in medium with S. aureus and performing serial dilutions at 4 and 8 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the surface of UM and CM with and without bacterial incubation. Results: There was an increasing ZOI for low-, medium-, and high-dose CM and no ZOI for UM (p &lt; 0.001 for all CM compared with UM). Incubating the mesh with various amounts of BSA produced persistent ZOIs with the medium- and high-dose CM; however, the low-dose CM became attenuated by such treatment, with no ZOI being seen with meshes incubated in 10% BSA. All concentrations of CM were bactericidal, as no bacteria grew at 8 h of incubation. The SEM images showed clusters of S. aureus on the surface of UM and no clusters on CM. Conclusions: The CM demonstrated significant bactericidal activity compared with UM. Nanocrystalline silver particles may decrease the incidence of postoperative prosthetic mesh infections and be useful as a coating for other prosthetic materials.

The addition of zirconia into an alumina matrix (zirconia-toughened alumina, ZTA) has been reported to result in an enhancement of flexural strength, fracture toughness, and fatigue resistance. The development of new processing routes in nonaqueous media has allowed to obtain high-density ZTA nanocomposites with a very homogeneous microstructure and a significantly smaller and narrower particle-size distribution of zirconia than conventional powder mixing methods. The aim of the present study was to set up and validate a new ZTA nanocomposite by testing its biocompatibility and wear behavior in a hip-joint simulator in comparison with commercial alumina and experimental alumina specimens. The primary osteoblast proliferation onto ZTA nanocomposite samples was found to be not significantly different from that onto commercial alumina samples. After 7 million cycles, no significant differences were observed between the wear behaviors of the three sets of cups. In this light, it can be affirmed that ZTA nanocomposite materials can offer the option of improving the lifetime and reliability of ceramic joint prostheses.

To address this, we characterized and compared the microbial communities of microplastic particles, nonplastic (natural and wax) particles, and the surrounding waters from three marine ecosystems (the Baltic, Sargasso and Mediterranean seas) using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that biofilm communities on microplastic and nonplastic particles were highly similar to one another across this broad geographical range. The similar temperature and salinity profiles of the Sargasso and Mediterranean seas, compared to the Baltic Sea, were reflected in the biofilm communities. We identified plastic-specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were not detected on nonplastic particles or in the surrounding waters. Twenty-six of the plastic-specific OTUs were geographically ubiquitous across all sampled locations. These geographically ubiquitous plastic-specific OTUs were mostly low-abundance members of their biofilm communities and often represented uncultured members of marine ecosystems. These results demonstrate the potential for plastics to be a reservoir of rare and understudied microbes, thus warranting further investigations into the dynamics and role of these microbes in marine ecosystems. IMPORTANCE This study represents one of the largest comparisons of biofilms from environmentally sampled plastic and nonplastic particles from aquatic environments. By including particles sampled through three separate campaigns in the Baltic, Sargasso, and Mediterranean seas, we were able to make cross-geographical comparisons and discovered common taxonomical signatures that define the plastic biofilm. For the first time, we identified plastic-specific bacteria that reoccur across marine regions. Our data reveal that plastics have selective properties that repeatedly enrich for similar bacteria regardless of location, potentially shifting aquatic microbial communities in areas with high levels of plastic pollution. Furthermore, we show that bacterial communities on plastic do not appear to be strongly influenced by polymer type, suggesting that other properties, such as the absorption and/or leaching of chemicals from the surface, are likely to be more important in the selection and enrichment of specific microorganisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",34106771,

However, regenerative biosensor for monitoring dopamine in the progress of physiological and pathological events is still challenging, due to lack of the platform for repetitive on-line detection-regeneration cycle. Herein, we have developed a regenerated field effect transistor (FET) combined with in vivo monitoring system. In this biosensor, gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles (Fe(3)O(4)@AuNPs) acts as a regenerated recognition unit for dopamine. Just by simple removal of a permanent magnet, dopamine on the biosensor interface are catalyzed by tyrosinase, thus achieving the regeneration of the biosensor. As a result, this FET biosensor not only reveals high sensitivity and selectivity, but also exhibits excellent stability after 15 regeneration processing. This biosensor is capable of monitor dopamine with a linear range between 1Â Î¼molÂ L(-1) and 120Â Î¼molÂ L(-1) and low detection limit (DL) of 3.3Â nmolÂ L(-1).

Despite subsequent restrictions, hazardous additives remain in plastics in societal circulation because of the pervasiveness of many products and the more general contamination of recycled goods. However, little is understood about their presence and impacts in the environment, with most studies focusing on the role of plastics in acquiring metals from their surroundings through, for example, adsorption. Accordingly, this paper provides a review of the uses of hazardous, metal-based additives in plastics, the relevant European regulations that have been introduced to restrict or prohibit usage in various sectors, and the likely environmental impacts of hazardous additives once plastics are lost in nature. Examination of the literature reveals widespread occurrence of hazardous metals in environmental plastics, with impacts ranging from contamination of the waste stream to increasing the density and settling rates of material in aquatic systems. A potential concern from an ecotoxicological perspective is the diffusion of metals from the matrix of micro- and nanoplastics under certain physico-chemical conditions, and especially favorable here are the acidic environments encountered in the digestive tract of many animals (birds, fish, mammals) that inadvertently consume plastics. For instance, in vitro studies have shown that the mobilization of Cd and Pb from historical microplastics can greatly exceed concentrations deemed to be safe according to migration limits specified by the current European Toy Safety Directive (17Â mgÂ kg(-1) and 23Â mgÂ kg(-1), respectively). When compared with concentrations of metals typically adsorbed to plastics from the environment, the risks from pervasive, historical additives are far more significant.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",34030075,

While the consequences of ingestion of large plastic litter are mostly understood, the impacts resulting from a long-term exposure and a recovery period of microplastics (MPs) are still limited. The aims were to monitor oxidative stress, detoxification and inflammatory biomarkers in liver, plasma and erythrocytes of Sparus aurata exposed during 90 days to low-density polyethylene (LDPE)-MPs enriched diet (10% by weight) followed by 30 days of depuration. Exposure to LDPE-MPs progressively activates the antioxidant and detoxification system and induces an inflammatory response in liver and plasma, whereas no significant changes were observed in erythrocytes. The plasma activities of catalase, myeloperoxidase (MPO), lysozyme and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) as maker of lipid peroxidation significantly increased after exposure to LDPE-MPs for 90 days compared to the control group. The activities of all antioxidant enzymes - catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase-, the detoxification enzyme glutathione s-transferase, MPO, the production of reactive oxygen species and the levels of MDA were also significantly increased in liver after MPs exposure. Additionally, all these biomarkers tended to recover during the depuration period, most of them reaching similar levels to those of the control group. In conclusion, the ingestion of a diet containing LDPE-MPs for 90 days induced a progressive increase in oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers in liver and plasma of S. aurata but not in erythrocytes, which tended to regain control values when not exposed to MPs for 30 days. The present study contributes to a better understanding of the toxic effects of MPs in S. aurata and highlights the usefulness of plasma that can be obtained in a minimally invasive way to monitor these effects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext",33975116,

Photon-counting CT (PCCT) with k-edge imaging aims to allow for the specific detection of macrophages using gold nanoparticles. Purpose To perform k-edge imaging in combination with gold nanoparticles to detect and quantify the macrophage burden within the atherosclerotic aortas of rabbits. Materials and Methods Atherosclerotic and control New Zealand white rabbits were imaged before and at several time points up to 2 days after intravenous injection of gold nanoparticles (3.5 mL/kg, 65 mg gold per milliliter). Aortic CT angiography was performed at the end of the follow-up using an intravenous injection of an iodinated contrast material. Gold k-edge and conventional CT images were reconstructed for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the macrophage burden. PCCT imaging results were compared with findings at histologic examination, quantitative histomorphometry, transmission electron microscopy, and quantitative inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Pearson correlations between the macrophage area measured in immunostained sections and the concentration of gold and attenuation measured in the corresponding PCCT sections were calculated. Results Seven rabbits with atherosclerosis and four control rabbits without atherosclerosis were analyzed. In atherosclerotic rabbits, calcifications were observed along the aortic wall before injection. At 2 days after injection of gold nanoparticles, only gold k-edge images allowed for the distinction of plaque enhancement within calcifications and for lumen enhancement during angiography. A good correlation was observed between the gold concentration measured within the wall and the macrophage area in 35 plaques (five per rabbit) (r = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.91; P < .001), which was higher than that observed on conventional CT images (r = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.65; P = .01). Transmission electron microscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry analyses confirmed the gold k-edge imaging findings. Conclusion Photon-counting CT with gold nanoparticles allowed for the noninvasive evaluation of both molecular and anatomic information in vivo in rabbits with atherosclerotic plaques.

The occurrence of MPs in the freshwater of Bangladesh is currently unreported, and in contrast to other counties of the world, little is known about the occurrence of this contaminant in freshwater fishes. Hence, this study investigated the abundance, characteristics, and variation of MPs in different commercial freshwater fish species from Bangladesh. This country generates a considerable amount of plastic waste annually, and a significant portion of its remains uncollected. Forty eight fishes from eighteen taxa spanning different feeding zones were collected to observe the difference in MPs ingestion rate among various feeding zones. MPs were found in the gastrointestinal tracts (GIT) of 73.3% of all examined fish samples, which is relatively higher than previously reported studies in other regions. The abundance of MPs was found highest in Mystus vittatus among all of the fish species. Microscopic analyses (polarized light, SEM) revealed that MPs were dominated by fiber in shape and transparent in color. Fourier Transform Infrared analysis (FTIR) showed that polymers found in fish GIT were high density polyethylene, polypropylene-polyethylene copolymer and ethylene vinyl acetate. The results of this study show that demersal fishes presented a higher amount of MPs than registered in benthopelagic and pelagic fishes, indicating the ingestion of plastics in fish may relate to the feeding habitat. However, differences in body weight and length of the fishes were not found to influence the MPs ingestion. Our findings will help to aware people which freshwater fishes and fishes from which feeding zone are more contaminated with MPs to human consumption in Bangladesh.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33894608,

Here, we evaluate deformable hydrogel microparticles as carriers for transporting nanoparticles to a diseased vascular wall. Depending on microparticle modulus, nanoparticle-loaded poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogel microparticles delivered significantly more 50-nm nanoparticles to the vessel wall than freely injected nanoparticles alone, resulting in >3000% delivery increase.

Hence, the specific detection of organic mercury has great significance for objectively assessing the health risk of mercury in seafood. We herein designed an aptamer (A(S-T7)), which consists of a silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) scaffold sequence (A(S)) and a T-rich sequence (A(T7)), for simultaneously synthetizing DNA-templated AgNCs and recognizing organic mercury, and further developed a label-free fluorescent method for the sensitive and specific determination of organic mercury (CH(3)Hg(+) and C(2)H(5)Hg(+) total concentration) by using DNA-templated AgNCs as signal. Without organic mercury, Ag(+) in the mixture of aptamer and Ag(+) was bond on A(S) of aptamer to form A(S)-templated AgNCs after reduction, and thus emitted strong fluorescence. Whereas, in the presence of organic mercury, CH(3)Hg(+)/C(2)H(5)Hg(+) was bond on A(T7) of aptamer to generate photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between CH(3)Hg(+)/C(2)H(5)Hg(+) and A(S)-templated AgNCs, and thus results in fluorescence quenching of A(S)-templated AgNCs. The fluorescent method could be used to rapidly detect organic mercury with a detection limit of 5.0Â nM (i.e. 1.01Â ng Hg/g), which meets the U.S. EPA standard of 0.3Â mg/kg (wet).

High microplastic concentration (800Â Î¼g/L) definitely cause significant damage to gills and intestines, in this situation, far beyond the possibility of fish own repair, and even when the threaten removed, silver carp can't recovery soon.

Through qPCR technology, the results indicated that zebrafish exposed to polyethylene MPs exhibited significant change in microbes of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia, etc. Moreover, 16S RNA gene sequencing revealed that there was a significant difference in alpha diversity between the control and 1000Â Î¼g/L MP-treated groups. At the genus level, the abundance of Aeromonas, Shewanella, Microbacterium, Nevskia and Methyloversatilis have increased remarkably. Conversely, the abundance of Pseudomonas, Ralstonia and Stenotrophomonas were significant reduction after MPs exposure. In addition, the levels of TG (triglyceride), TCHO (total cholesterol), NEFA (nonesterified fatty acid), TBA (total bile acid), GLU (glucose) and pyruvic acid significantly changed in MP-treated larval zebrafish, indicating that their metabolism was disturbed by MPs. Transcriptional levels of glucose and lipid metabolism-related genes showed a decreasing trend. Furthermore, LC/MS-based nontargeted metabolomics analysis demonstrated that a total of 59 phospholipid-related substances exhibited significant changes in larval fish treated with 1000Â Î¼g/L MPs. The mRNA levels of phospholipid metabolism-related genes were also obviously changed. Pearson correlation analysis indicated that the abundance of Aeromonas, Shewanella and Chitinibacter bacteria showed a negative correlation with most phospholipids, while Nevskia, Parvibacter and Lysobacter showed a positive correlation with most phospholipids. Based on these results, it is suggested that 1-4Â Î¼m PE-MPs could impact the microbiome and metabolism of larval zebrafish.

To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the microplastic distribution in Bandon Bay, one of the most important maricultural areas of Thailand. Water and sediment samples from the Tapi-Phumduang River system (n = 10) and Bandon Bay (n = 5) were collected. Water sampling at the river mouth was carried out during a complete tidal cycle to estimate the microplastic flux to the bay during the wet season. Moreover, two commercial bivalve species grown in the bay, the green mussel (Perna viridis) and lyrate Asiatic hard clam (Meretrix lyrata), were analyzed. More items of microplastics were found in the river system than in the bay. During the tide cycle, one-third of the microplastics entering the bay were washed back upstream during high tide. This backflow consisted mainly of larger microplastics. The average daily load of microplastics to the bay was 22.4 Ã— 10(9) items day(-1). The load during low tide was approximately 4-5 times higher than that during high tide. The overall accumulation of microplastics in the bottom sediments of the river and in the bay was similar (p < 0.05). Green mussels showed significantly higher contamination with microplastics than clams. Notably, the small-sized shellfish contained more particles (items/g) than the large ones (p < 0.05). Fibers were detected in virtually all samples: water (98%), sediment (94%), mussels (100%), and clams (95%). Among these, microfibers (<1 mm) were detected in water (71%), sediment (63%), green mussels (63%), and clams (52%). Blue and white particles were the two most frequently observed colors, while the most dominant polymers were rayon, followed by polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and nylon. To this end, we posit that river discharge was a significant source of microplastics in Bandon Bay, with minor additional contributions from fishing and mariculture activities within the bay. Ultimately, these microplastics may end up in the sediments and living organisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33812121,

This included characterizing its colony morphology, genotype and virulence status. The isolate was incorporated into a mucoadhesive polymer chitosan-complexed nanovaccine (CS-NE), the efficacy of which was determined by experimentally infecting red tilapia that had been vaccinated with the nanoparticles by immersion. The experimental infection was performed 30-days post-vaccination (dpv), which resulted in 89% of the unvaccinated control fish dying, while the relative percentage survival (RPS) of the CS-NE vaccinated group was 78%.

Measuring the patterns of microplastic pollution in the past is critical for predicting future trends and for understanding the relationship between plastics in fish and the environment. We measured microplastics in digestive tissues of specimens collected from the years 1900-2017 and preserved in museum collections. We collected new fish specimens in 2018, along with water and sediment samples. We selected four species: Micropterus salmoides (largemouth bass), Notropis stramineus (sand shiner), Ictalurus punctatus (channel catfish), and Neogobius melanostomus (round goby) because each was well represented in museum collections, are locally abundant, and collected from urban habitats. For each individual, we dissected the digestive tissue from esophagus to anus, subjected tissue to peroxide oxidation, examined particles under a dissecting microscope, and used Raman spectroscopy to characterize the particles' chemical composition. No microplastics were detected in any fish prior to 1950. From mid-century to 2018, microplastic concentrations showed a significant increase when data from all fish were considered together. All detected particles were fibers, and represented plastic polymers (e.g., polyester) along with mixtures of natural and synthetic textiles. For the specimens collected in 2018, microplastics in fish and sediment showed similar patterns across study sites, while water column microplastics showed no differences among locations. Overall, plastic pollution in common freshwater fish species is increasing and pervasive across individuals and species, and is likely related to changes in environmental concentrations. Museum specimens are an overlooked source for assessing historical patterns of microplastic pollution, and for predicting future trends in freshwater fish, thereby helping to sustain the health of commercial and recreational fisheries worldwide.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33650187,

The results illustrated that PE could be as 9-NAnt carrier to enter into zebrafish body, but significantly reduced the bioaccumulation of 9-NAnt, due to the occurrence of adsorption interactions between the simultaneous presence of both PE and 9-NAnt.

After 7 days exposure to PE-9-NAnt (40Â mg/L), the P4501A activity increased significantly, but the activities of AChE and LDH were inhibited clearly, causing certain neurotoxicity and disorders of energy metabolism to zebrafish. The analysis of integrated biomarker response index (IBR) suggested that PE had greater bio-toxicity to zebrafish in all exposure groups after short-term exposure, but the PE-9-NAnt complex showed greater bio-toxicity after 7 days, which indicated that complex exposure of PE-9-NAnt had a delayed effect on the bio-toxicity of zebrafish. Furthermore, analysis of the intestinal microbiota exhibited that under the conditions of the exposure group with 9-NAnt, the relative abundance of the five dominant bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteriota, Bacteroidota and Verrucomicrobiota) changed greatly. Overall, this study confirmed that PE could carry 9-NAnt into fish causing bioaccumulation, but in the case of coexisting exposures, PE reduced 9-NAnt bioaccumulation, suggesting that microplastics with other emerging pollutants in chronic toxicity are probably next objects in future works.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext,QUE: Microbiota",33640823,

Discarded masks will be finally drained to the ocean polluting the marine environment and threatening marine life. This short communication examines the role of face masks and subsequently mask-derived microplastics as pollutant carriers in environmental compartments (e.g. hydrosphere, biosphere, etc.) by investigating their sorption characteristics regarding dye molecules. In this context, batch-type equilibrium experiments were performed and the effect of different sorption parameters has been explored (i.e. contact time and temperature). The results show that single-use surgical face masks can act as dye carriers (Methylene Blue, Crystal Violet and Malachite Green) in the aquatic environment. In addition, preliminary experiments on the thermal treatment of face masks and the use of the resulting carbonaceous material as efficient adsorbent have been performed, pointing out a possibility for used mask disinfection and recycling.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33518855,PMC7834851

While there is evidence that commercial marine species are contaminated with MPs, it is still unknown if seafood can act as a vector for MP transfer to human consumers. Microplastics have been reported in the digestive tract, gills and in select internal organs of marine animals. However, many of these tissues are not typically eaten by human consumers but discarded. In this critical review, we examined the peer-reviewed literature for evidence of MP contamination in seafood, and the potential transfer to human consumers. Based on known seafood consumption patterns in a typical Australian diet, we assessed the relevance and reliability of the current body of literature to examine the prospect and risk of MP transfer. The relevance of data was considered based on the organism studied, origin of the samples, and the tissues analysed, while reliability was assessed based on procedural methodologies used to derive the data. A review of 132 studies found limited evidence of MP contamination in edible tissues from fresh fish or crustaceans. MP presence was confirmed in packaged fish, as well as in fresh and packaged bivalve molluscs. The limited number of studies satisfying the relevance and reliability criteria (nÂ =Â 24) precluded a quantitative assessment of the potential risk associated with MP transfer. While consumption of packaged fish and bivalve molluscs may result in the consumption of MPs by humans, it is currently unknown whether this presents a health risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33618116,

Such species play a key role in the food web of littoral systems since they are litter-feeders, and are prey for fishes or higher trophic level species. A preliminary investigation was conducted on five species of small-sized amphipod crustaceans, with the aim to understand if such an animal group may reflect the risk to ecosystems health in the central Mediterranean area, recently investigated for seawater and fish contamination. This study intended to gather data related to the accumulation of plasticizers in such coast dwelling fauna. In order to detect the possible presence of xenobiotics in amphipods, six analytes were scored (phthalic acid esters and non-phthalate plasticizers), identified and quantified by the gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. The results showed that among all the monitored contaminants, DEP and DiBP represented the most abundant compounds in the selected amphipods. The amphipod crustaceans analyzed were a good tool to detect and monitor plasticizers, and further studies of these invertebrates will help in developing a more comprehensive knowledge of chemicals spreading over a geographical area.

It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood. GOALS: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health. METHODS: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. ENVIRONMENTAL FINDINGS: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources - coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths. ECOSYSTEM FINDINGS: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks. HUMAN HEALTH FINDINGS: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children's risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals - phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste - can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South - environmental injustice on a planetary scale. CONCLUSIONS: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth's resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted.Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored.Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries. RECOMMENDATIONS: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health.Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress.Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries.Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33354517,PMC7731724

We looked into the capacity of multiple fish species to describe the distribution and composition of microlitter vertically across different compartments of the water column. A total of 502 individuals from six selected species (Scomber scombrus, Oblada melanura, Spicara smaris, Boops boops, Merluccius merluccius and Mullus barbatus) were collected on the western side of Sardinia island and allocated to three compartments: surface, mid-water and bottom. The species of the surface exhibited a higher frequency of occurrence (41.89%) of microlitter ingestion, compared to those of the mid-water and bottom (19.60%; 22.58%). A significant difference in the average number of ingested microlitter was found between the surface and the bottom compartment. All the microlitter fragments found were analysed through Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The comparison of the expected buoyancies of the polymers identified puth faith in the allocation of the species to the respective compartments.

Results indicated that separate MPS and NPS had no acute toxicity and little reproductive toxicity on zebrafish. TPhP alone was a highly toxic substance with a median lethal concentration (LC(50)) of 976Â Î¼g/L, the presence of MPS and NPS did not have significant effect on the acute toxicity of TPhP. TPhP alone stimulated the enlargement of liver and gonad of fish (except the testis) by 1.25-2.12 fold, and the presence of NPS further aggravated this stimulation by 1.23-2.84 fold, while MPS did not. The gonadal histology indicated that comparing with TPhP alone, the addition of MPS and NPS further inhibited the process of spermatogenesis and oogenesis, even causing obvious lacunas in testis and atretic follicles oocytes in ovary. Meanwhile, TPhP did not significantly disturb the hormone homeostasis (E(2)/T) and vitellogenin (Vtg) content in fish, but the presence of NPS increased the E(2)/T ratio and Vtg content in male fish, while slightly decreased those in female fish, which implying that effects of PS was sex-dependent. As a result, the egg production, the fertilization rate and hatchability of eggs significantly reduced after combined TPhP+PS exposure, demonstrating that co-occurrence of TPhP and PS, especially NPS, could greatly impaired the reproductive performance of zebrafish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext",33307501,

Numerous drugs are in practice to control this disease and their vectors. Eco-friendly control tools are required to battle against vector of this significant disease. Nanotechnology plays a major role in fighting against malaria. The present paper synthesized Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) using zinc nitrate via simple green routes with the help of aqueous peel extract of Lagenaria siceraria (L. siceraria). The synthesized ZnO NPs were characterized by various biophysical methods. Moreover, the extract of L. siceraria and their mediated ZnO NPs was experimented against III instar larvae of An. stephensi. The impact of the treatment based on ZnO NPs concerning histology and morphology of mosquito larval was further observed. In the normal laboratory environment, the efficiency of predation of Poeciliareticulata (P. reticulata) against An. Stephensi larvae was found to be 44%, whereas in aqueous L. siceraria extract and its mediated ZnO NPs contaminated environment, P. reticulate showed predation efficiency of about 45.8% and 61.13% against An.

RESULTS: Fish skin-dressed wounds showed a significant (P < 0.0001) reduction in microbial counts (Total viable bacterial count, Staphylococcal count, and Coliform count), a significant (P < 0.0001) decrease in the wound size, and a significant reduction (P < 0.0001) in the epithelial gap compared to the untreated wounds. No frequent dressing changes were needed. CONCLUSIONS: Fish skin dressing accelerated the wound healing process and efficiently inhibited the local microbial activity and exuberant granulation tissue formation suggesting its reliable and promising application for metacarpal wounds of donkeys.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",33272259,PMC7713020

Moreover, we evaluated their hazardous effects using biochemical markers of cytotoxicity. Polymer distribution and composition in gill, gut, and liver were analyzed using polarized light microscopy (PLM) and Raman microspectroscopy (RMS). Our findings revealed the size-dependent ingestion and accumulation of smaller MPs (0.45-3Â Âµm) in fish tissues even after a short-term exposure (3 and 5 days). In addition to MPs, our results showed the presence of plastic additives including plasticizers, flame retardants, curing agents, heat stabilizers, and fiber-reinforced plastic materials in fish tissues, which contributed mostly to the larger-sized range (â‰¥ 1.2Â Âµm). Our data showed that significant oxidative alterations were highly correlated with MPs size range. Our results emphasized that the toxicity of smaller EMPs (â‰¤ 3Â Âµm) was closely related to different factors, including the target tissue, exposure duration, size range of MPs, and their chemical properties.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Fulltext,MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""\""no mortality\"" report""]}",33265060,

The fusion protein PML-RARÎ± occurs in 95% of acute promyelocytic leukemia cases and is considered as diagnostically relevant. The fusion protein is formed as a result of translocation t(15,17) and is detected in the laboratory by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Diagnostic methods require many laboratory steps with specialized staff. The developed microfluidic assay includes a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system for PML-RARÎ± on surface of magnetic microparticles in a microfluidic chip. A rapid detection of PML-RARÎ± in cell lysates is achieved in less than one hour. A biotinylated PML-antibody on the surface of magnetic streptavidin coated microparticles is used as capture antibody. The bound translocation product is detected by a RARÎ± antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and the substrate QuantaRed. The analysis is performed in microfluidic channels which involves automated liquid processing with stringent washing and short incubation times. The results of the developed assay show that cell lysates of PML-RARÎ±-positive cells (NB-4) can be clearly distinguished from PML-RARÎ±-negative cells (HL-60, MV4-11).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33255664,PMC7728129

After 36 days, there was no effect of glitter on overall assemblage structure or diversity indices, however there was a two-fold increase in the abundance of New Zealand mud snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in response to MRC glitter. In addition, the root length of common duckweed (Lemna minor) and phytoplankton biomass (based on chlorophyll content) were significantly reduced by exposure to any type of glitter. On the contrary, the chlorophyll content in the sediment (indicating microphytobenthos biomass) was significantly greater in those exposed to synthetic mica glitter. Organic matter content of sediment did not differ amongst any of the treatments. However initially, on days 8 and 15, NO(3)(2-) concentration in the control treatment were significantly greater than in all glitter treatments, but this observation disappeared over time.

High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are a class of blood plasma LPs that mediate reverse cholesterol transport (RCT)-cholesterol transport from the peripheral tissues to the liver. Due to this ability to promote cholesterol uptake from cell membranes, HDL possess antiatherogenic properties. This function was first observed at the end of the 1970s to the beginning of the 1980s, resulting in high interest in this class of LPs. It was shown that HDL are the prevalent class of LPs in several types of living organisms (from fishes to monkeys) with high resistance to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disorders. Lately, understanding of the mechanisms of the antiatherogenic properties of HDL has significantly expanded. Besides the contribution to RCT, HDL have been shown to modulate inflammatory processes, blood clotting, and vasomotor responses. These particles also possess antioxidant properties and contribute to immune reactions and intercellular signaling.

Larvae were exposed to 20Â Î¼g/L of microplastic fragments or 20 and 100Â Î¼g/L of TPhP or a combination of both for 7Â days. The results showed that the three microplastics did not affect the larval locomotor activity.

Exposure to 100Â Î¼g/L TPhP respectively down-regulated the expression levels of sine oculis homeobox homologue 3 (six3) and short wavelength-sensitive type 2 (sws2) by 19.1% and 41.7%, suggesting that TPhP might disturb eye development and photoreception and consequently the low locomotor activity in the larvae. Interestingly, during the binary mixture exposure, the presence of PS, PS-COOH or PS-NH(2) reversed the low locomotor activity induced by 100Â Î¼g/L TPhP to the normal level. Relative to the larvae from the 100Â Î¼g/L TPhP group, the movement duration and distance moved were increased by approximately 60% and 100%, respectively, in the larvae from the TPhPÂ +Â PS, TPhPÂ +Â PS-COOH and TPhPÂ +Â PS-NH(2) groups.

The six WWTPs employ different treatment processes and serve different populations and types of factories. The average abundance of MPs in the effluents of all six WWTPs was 1.719 Â± 1.035 MP/L.

The results showed that advanced or tertiary treatment technologies could substantially remove MPs and that the size of the population served was positively associated with the abundance of MPs. The number of textile factories was a key factor contributing to the total release of MPs. In addition, the MP shapes and polymer compositions showed that the occurrence of MP types is regional, varies regionally, and is related to the types of factories in the vicinity.

Like any food, seafood can involve hazards transmitted to humans through food, which affect the health of the consumer. These hazards are both biological (viruses, bacteria, parasites) and chemical (toxins, allergens, chemicals, microplastics). The exposure of populations to these hazards through seafood consumption can be notably explained by their mode of production and the dietary habits. Firstly, the sanitary quality of products reflects the quality of the aquatic environment from which they are taken, which can be contaminated by various types of pollution (faecal or chemical, chronic or accidental). The products are then handled, often treated without using additives or chemical preservatives, and finally distributed without any other means of preservation than refrigeration or freezing. Finally, the dietary habits of seafood favour exposure to certain hazards. Seafood safety must be integrated throughout the food chain, under the responsibility shared by all stakeholders.

Results indicate that ALDFGs are quickly covered by biofouling, reaching maximum values of cover in one year. At this depth, the biofouling community results highly influenced by light-dependent seasonal cycles and a general four-steps colonization scheme is tentatively depicted: i) biofouling community is initially dominated by fast-growing organisms, with algae and hydrozoans settling after two weeks; ii) small-sized carbonatic organisms (e.g. bryozoans) appear after two months; iii) the same organisms (including coralline algae) become abundant after five to eight months; iv) conspicuous carbonatic skeletons (serpulids, bivalves and bryozoans) occur after one year increasing in complexity in the following months. The biofouling settled on ALDFGs, as well as growth rates of large carbonatic species, could provide useful information to estimate the age of lost lines and nets in retrieved material and in situ photo footage complementing the overview of the fishing impact in this specific environment.

Under the ANT-MPs co-exposure conditions, PE-MPs rapidly accumulated in the gastrointestinal tract of the medaka during a 14-day uptake phase, with an average bioconcentration factor of 171.4 L/kg. The PE-MPs could absorb and accumulate approximately 70 % of the ANT from the water sample. The PE-MPs changed the pharmacokinetic profile of ANT in medaka by decreasing both the uptake and depuration rate constants. The one compartment with first-order elimination model estimated that the amounts of ANT in the water phase and absorbed by PE-MPs (i.e., a vector effect) contributed about 67 % and 33 % of the ANT accumulation in medaka, respectively. At the end of the uptake (exposure) phase, however, the presence of PE-MPs did not significantly alter the final ANT concentrations in the fish body or alter the behavioral impacts of ANT. Thus, PE-MPs ingestion may act as a vector to concentrate and transfer ANT to medaka, but the presence of these particles may have limited adverse effects on fish under co-exposure systems of the type used in this study.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext,without virgin particle | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",33017738,

Mice were sacrificed at the 8th week where both worms and eggs were counted in the hepatic and porto-mesenteric vessels in the liver and intestine, respectively, in addition to a histopathological examination of the liver granuloma. Curcumin caused a significant reduction in the worms and egg count (45.45%) at the 3rd week. A significant schistosomicidal effect of PZQ was found in all groups. Cur-GNPs combined with PZQ 97.4% reduction of worm burden in the 3rd week and the highest reduction in the intestinal and hepatic egg content, as well, besides 70.1% reduction of the granuloma size. The results suggested the curcumin in combination with PZQ as a strong schistosomicidal regimen against S. mansoni as it alters the hematological, biochemical, and immunological changes induced.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",32978497,PMC7519097

After removing the background monomer compounds, PA6 and PA66 were efficiently depolymerized to 6-aminocaproic acid and adipic acid, respectively, and detected by LC-MS/MS. Accordingly, the quantity of nylon MPs was accurately calculated. By using the proposed method, the recovery of spiked PA6 and PA66 MPs in the environmental samples ranged from 90.8 to 98.8%. The limits of quantification for PA6 and PA66 MPs were 0.680 and 4.62 mg/kg, respectively. PA MPs were widely detected in indoor dust, sludge, marine sediment, freshwater sediment, fishery sediment, and fish guts and gills with concentrations of 0.725-321 mg/kg. Extremely high concentrations of PA66 MPs were detected in indoor dust and fish guts and gills, indicating the unequivocal risk of human exposure through dust ingestion and dietary exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32969220,

Based on published information, we matched the apical toxicity endpoints induced by MP/NPs with key event (KE) or adverse outcomes (AO) and categorized them according to the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) online knowledgebase. We used existing AOPs and applied them to highlight formal mechanistic links between identified KEs and AOs in two possible scenarios: first from ecological, and second from public health perspective. Ecological perspective AOP based literature analysis revealed that MP/NPs share formation of reactive oxygen species as their molecular initiating event, leading to adverse outcomes such as growth inhibition and behavior alteration through oxidative stress cascades and inflammatory responses. Application of AOP on literature data related to public health perspective of MP/NPs showed that oxidative stress and its responding pathways, including inflammatory responses, could play the role of key events. However insufficient information prevented precise definitions of AOPs at this level. To overcome this knowledge gap, further mammalian model and epidemiological studies are necessary to support development and construction of detailed AOPs with public health focus.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32863185,PMC7767742

CeO(2)-NP caused marked changes in the gills (aneurysms, blood capillary congestion, lamellar hypertrophy and hyperplasia, secondary lamella fusion and epithelial lifting), in liver (pyknotic nucleus, hyperemia, enlargement of sinusoids and leucocyte infiltration) and kidney (shrinkage of the glomeruli, enlargement of the Bowman space, tubular degeneration and nuclear hypertrophy). Moreover, a semi-quantitative histopathological scoring system (pathological index) confirmed significant alterations in the three organs of all exposed fish. Furthermore, a significant increase of GDI indices observed in gills and liver, for all tested concentrations, indicated a dose-dependent effect.

The current knowledge on the occurrence of MPs in aquaculture fish ponds in a typical estuary system remains meagre. This study investigated the abundance and characteristics (shape, color, size and composition) of MPs in aquaculture water and pond influents in the Pearl River Estuary of Guangzhou, China, using an improved separation method. The bulk sampling and improved separation method by the combination of ethanol and polyaluminum chloride (PAC) significantly increased the MP separation efficiency, especially for particles with size less than <333Â Î¼m. The investigation results showed that MPs were detected in all water samples of fish ponds at two experimental stations with abundances of 10.3-60.5 particles/L (S1) and 33.0-87.5 particles/L (S2), respectively. Moreover, the average abundance of MPs in aquaculture water (42.1 particles/L) exhibited higher value than that in pond influents (32.1 particles/L). Most of MPs were colored and fibrous in appearance. MPs with the size range of <1000Â Î¼m (56.3-87.7%) prevailed in aquaculture water. MPs with size <333Â Î¼m that usually ignored in most studies were detected with percentage of 43.7% at S1station and 33.2% at S2 station, respectively. The small-sized MPs (<100Â Î¼m) in aquaculture water (23.7% at S1 station and 14.6% at S2 station) were more abundant than those in pond influents (7.2% at S1 station and 2.5% at S2 station). The main composition of MPs was polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). These findings indicated a high level of MP pollution in aquaculture fish ponds. The MPs originated from the Pearl River Estuary were accumulated in aquaculture fish ponds. This study provides an insight into MP pollution in aquaculture fish ponds at a typical estuarine system and highlights the load of MPs in the pond influents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32755771,

The sediments, which were adjacent either to land with a large stream of people and vehicles or to areas with frequent watersports, had notably high abundance of MPs, revealing the close correlation between the spatial distribution of MPs in lake sediments and human activities. It is thought that atmospheric precipitation (fiber), stormwater, washing of clothes (fiber), degradation of large plastics in the lake, and fishing activities (fishing nets, foam) are the main sources of MPs in lake sediments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32608897,

These findings suggested that multi-level IBR approach should be adopted to quantify effects of MPs on aquatic organisms, especially on fish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Fulltext,MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome",32521315,

A total of eight MPs were retrieved from a total of 140 individual fish examined, with an average of 0.057Â Â±Â 0.019 microplastic items per fish (excluding possible plastic fibers). On average, 5.71%, of the fish dissected contained MPs, ranging from 5 to 15% of individual fish examined containing MPs among species (Siganus canaliculatus and Rastrelliger kanagurta, respectively). Ingested plastic consisted primarily of fishing threads (1.04Â Â±Â 0.06Â mm), followed by fragments (1.16Â Â±Â 0.11Â mm). It is likely that the fibers, originated from the fisheries, recreational boating, laundry, domestic wastewater, and other human activities, which is also widespread and abundant (found in 58.58% of the fish studied). Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) were identified as the most abundant polymers ingested by the fishes. There was no significant difference (pÂ <Â 0.05) between the presence of microplastic in fish depending on their habitat. The prevalence of MPs is relatively low compared to those in other regions, despite the massive industrialization of the Saudi Arabian Gulf.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32479293,

Recent scientific studies have documented their toxic effects at the cellular and molecular levels, but knowledge underlying mechanisms of their toxicity is still scarce. Nanoplastics are known for their ability to induce immune and inflammatory responses as well as generating reactive oxygen species. While some studies have addressed the immunotoxicity of nanoplastics in vitro and on in vivo in fish after intraperitoneal injection, no information is available on adult fish after ingestion of a contaminated prey. The present study is the first to attempt to address the immunotoxicity of nanoplastics in adult fish after trophic transfer. Pimephales promelas is a well-established bioindicator species to study the immunotoxicity of nanoparticles and the innate immune responses of fish. This study aims to assess the in vivo innate immune response of adult P. promelas following exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics by measuring the gene expression of ncf, nox2, mst1 and c3; these genes are related with the immune function of neutrophils, macrophages and complement in fish. Two target organs (liver and head kidney) and two routes of exposure (IP- injection and ingestion) were analyzed. After 48â€¯h of exposure, polystyrene nanoplastics were encountered in the liver and kidney of both IP-injection and ingestion exposed fish, and significantly affected the innate immune system of P. promelas by downregulating the gene expression ncf, mst1, and c3 in liver and kidney. Significant difference between treatments was only observed for the gene expression of nfc in liver. Results of this study indicate that polystyrene nanoplastics can exhibit immunotoxicity in fish through an environmentally relevant route of exposure, interfering with the synthesis and function of neutrophils, macrophages, and complement of P. promelas in their principal hematopoietic tissues, which may potentially compromise its ability to survive in nature.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Fulltext,MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""não reporta, mas relata registro de mortalidade, incluímos?""]}",32470671,

A total of 109 fish samples consisting of eight (8) species: Coptodon zillii (CZ: nâ€‰=â€‰38), Oreochromis niloticus (ON: nâ€‰=â€‰43), Sarotheron melanotheron (SM: nâ€‰=â€‰19), Chrysicthys nigrodigitatus (CN: nâ€‰=â€‰3), Lates niloticus (LN: nâ€‰=â€‰3), Paranchanna obscura (PO: nâ€‰=â€‰1), Hemichromis fasiatus (HF: nâ€‰=â€‰1), and Hepsetus odoe (HO: nâ€‰=â€‰1) were collected between February-April, 2018. Fish stomach content was screened for the presence of MPs using the density gradient separation technique (NaCl hypersaline solution) and examined using a fluorescence microscope.

Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) identified ecological variables such as habitat, feeding mode, and trophic levels as critical factors that may determine and influence MP uptake in fish population. The PCA showed stronger association between fish habitat, feeding mode, and trophic level with MP size and number in the benthopelagic species (ON CZ and SM), compared to demersal species (PO CN HO and LN).

Individuals were either dead prior to reaching the Center or died within 24Â h of arrival with no food consumed during captivity. Sixty-three individuals representing eight species were dissected to extract the gastrointestinal (GI) tract from the esophagus to the large intestine. Microplastics were found in the GI tracts in all examined species and in all individual birds. The overall mean number (Â±S.E.) of microplastics for species of bird of prey in central Florida was 11.9 (Â±2.8), and the overall mean number of microplastics per gram of GI tract tissue was 0.3 (Â±0.1). A total of 1197 pieces of plastic were recorded. Microfibers accounted for 86% of total plastics followed by microfragments (13%), macroplastics (0.7%) and microbeads (0.3%). Most fibers were either clear or royal blue in color. Micro-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (Î¼-FTIR) found that processed cellulose was the most common polymer identified in birds (37%), followed by polyethylene terephthalate (16%) and a polymer blend (4:1) of polyamide-6 and poly(ethylene-co-polypropylene) (11%). Two bird species, Buteo lineatus (red-shouldered hawk, nÂ =Â 28) and Pandion haliaetus (osprey, nÂ =Â 16), were sufficiently abundant to enable statistical analyses.

After exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of MPs and HMs, significant alterations of intestinal microbiota were found. The MPs treatment reduced the diversity and abundance of intestinal microbiota, while the HMs and MPs-HMs treatments increased them, which were confirmed by the abundance changes of Proteobacteria. According to the KEGG analysis, the metabolism and environmental information processing (EIP) pathways in the microbial community were significantly affected. This study showed that the MPs-HMs treatment caused a higher pollution load on the gut of the marine medaka, and triggered more significant changes of specific bacterial species and gut function in the males. However, during the gonadal development, HMs and MPs-HMs treatments resulted in empty follicles (EF) and follicular atresia (FA), and altered the gene expression levels related to hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. In short, this study demonstrated that the reproductive disturbance was mainly due to HMs, but the combination of MPs and HMs did not strengthen the risk to the gonad development of the marine medaka.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Microbiota,ANG: Fulltext,MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext,QUE: Microbiota | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome",32388101,

Their presence in seawater and marine sediments poses a legitimate environmental and ecological concern for toxicity and food chain transfer via marine organisms. Their capability for sorption of other hydrophobic contaminants and the inability of the wastewater treatment plants to completely remove them pose additional risks. This review highlights the methodologies for sampling, sample preparation, and identification used in the Persian/Arabian Gulf region, which is possibly one of the least studied marginal seas with only sixteen papers published on microplastics. The review highlights the several orders of magnitude variations in microplastic concentrations among different studies; e.g. in seawater, only 12 microplastic particles were reported from 40 transects of one km length in Kuwait to 0.71Â microplasticsÂ m(-3) in Qatar. Concentrations in beach sediments also show the significant difference between the northern and southern Gulf coasts, with 13 particles in 24 samples reported in Qatar, and 15 particles within 44 samples across Kuwait, to 3252Â Â±Â 2766Â particlesÂ m(-2) from Bandar Abbas, Iran. The biota samples also show similar variances, with only three particles identified from 87 gut samples in Kuwait to 828 particles in 58 samples that include 46 fish and 12 shrimps from Iran. Some extremely high concentrations in biota are also reported from Iran, with concentrations as high as 0.251Â particlesÂ g(-1) of muscle and 0.931Â particlesÂ g(-1) in gills. It is evident that there is no consensus in the Gulf region on the sampling techniques (mesh size of plankton nets and sieves), use of fluidization solutions and very different units used in data reporting such as particlesÂ m(-3) and particlesÂ m(-2) in water samples. In sediments units like particlesÂ g(-1) and particlesÂ m(-2) have been used, and for biota it is the number of particles present in the sample, while others have quantified data as particlesÂ g(-1) of tissue. Considering the higher densities of PET, PVC, nylon and polyester than seawater, they are likely to migrate downwards into marine sediments, a transfer process that has not been studied in detail. Thus the review underscores the need to adopt harmonized protocols for microplastic studies in the region, and identifies certain aspects of microplastics that require further study.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32319924,

SEM-EDAX spectra revealed the weathered MP surfaces which could adsorb/leach inorganic elements (colorants and fillers) from/to the environment. We may conclude that the concentration of MPs in fishes is a function of the concentration of MPs in their environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32143031,

Microplastics are potentially more hazardous than macroplastics, as the former can permeate biological membranes. The toxicity of microplastic exposure on humans and aquatic organisms has been documented, but the toxicity and behavioral changes of nanoplastics (NPs) in mammals are scarce. In spite of their small size, nanoplastics have an enormous surface area, which bears the potential to bind even bigger amounts of toxic compounds in comparison to microplastics. Here, we used polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) (diameter size at ~70 nm) to investigate the neurobehavioral alterations, tissue distribution, accumulation, and specific health risk of nanoplastics in adult zebrafish. The results demonstrated that PS-NPs accumulated in gonads, intestine, liver, and brain with a tissue distribution pattern that was greatly dependent on the size and shape of the NPs particle. Importantly, an analysis of multiple behavior endpoints and different biochemical biomarkers evidenced that PS-NPs exposure induced disturbance of lipid and energy metabolism as well as oxidative stress and tissue accumulation. Pronounced behavior alterations in their locomotion activity, aggressiveness, shoal formation, and predator avoidance behavior were exhibited by the high concentration of the PS-NPs group, along with the dysregulated circadian rhythm locomotion activity after its chronic exposure. Moreover, several important neurotransmitter biomarkers for neurotoxicity investigation were significantly altered after one week of PS-NPs exposure and these significant changes may indicate the potential toxicity from PS-NPs exposure. In addition, after ~1-month incubation, the fluorescence spectroscopy results revealed the accumulation and distribution of PS-NPs across zebrafish tissues, especially in gonads, which would possibly further affect fish reproductive function. Overall, our results provided new evidence for the adverse consequences of PS-NPs-induced behavioral dysregulation and changes at the molecular level that eventually reduce the survival fitness of zebrafish in the ecosystem.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext",32093039,PMC7073134

Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome heterogeneity of 12â€¯000 intestinal cells obtained from zebrafish exposed to 100 nm, 5 Î¼m, and 200 Î¼m PS-MPs for 21 days. Eight intestinal cell populations were identified. Combined with changes in intestinal microbiota, our findings highlight a previously unrecognized end point that all three sizes of PS-MPs induced dysfunction of intestinal immune cells (including effects on phagosomes and the regulation of immune system processes) and increased the abundance of pathogenic bacteria. However, only 100 nm PS-MPs altered the expression of genes related to phagocyte-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and increased mucus secretion by secretory cells. Microsize PS-MPs specifically changed the lysosome (5 Î¼m) and cell surface receptor signaling (200 Î¼m) processes of the macrophages. Our findings pinpoint to cell-specific and size-dependent responses to PS-MPs in fish intestine, which can provide a reference for future study directions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext,QUE: Microbiota | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome",32092251,

The in vitro efficacy of GRFT NP-EFs was assessed using HIV-1 pseudovirus assays, demonstrating complete in vitro protection against HIV-1 infection. Additionally, sustained-release NP-EFs, administered 24Â h prior to infection, prevented against a lethal dose of HSV-2 infection in a murine model. In parallel, histology and cytokine expression from murine reproductive tracts and vaginal lavages collected 24 and 72Â h post-administration were similar to untreated mice, suggesting that NP-EF composites may be a promising and safe sustained-delivery platform to prevent HSV-2 infection.

Constituents of plant essential oils such as nerolidol are being considered as replacements for synthetic drugs to support fish nutrition and health. There is evidence to suggest that nanotechnology may enhance the efficacy of natural bioactive compounds; this is a substantial advance for the development and sustainability of aquaculture. Against the backdrop of this evidence, we aimed determine whether dietary supplementation with free nerolidol and nerolidol-loaded nanospheres would exert bactericidal effects against S. agalactiae, as well as prevent S. agalactiae-induced brain oxidative damage. In Experiment I, we measured the antimicrobial properties of dietary supplementation of nerolidol and nerolidol nanosphere in terms of mortality, longevity and relative percent survival. Fish infected with S. agalactiae fed 0.5 and 1.0Â mL nerolidol nanospheres kg/diet demonstrated lower mortality and higher relative percent survival than the control group, while longevity was higher in all infected plus supplementation groups. Experiment II showed significantly lower microbial loads in brains of fish infected with S. agalactiae that were fed 1.0Â mL nerolidol nanospheres kg/diet than in the control group. Brain nerolidol levels were significantly higher in uninfected as well as infected fish supplemented with nerolidol nanospheres than in fish supplemented with free nerolidol. Finally, brain reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation levels were higher in infected fish supplemented with basal diet compared to uninfected fish and supplemented with basal diet, and the supplementation with 1.0Â mL/kg nerolidol nanospheres prevented this augmentation caused by infection. These data suggest that dietary supplementation with nerolidol nanospheres (1.0Â mL/kg diet) has potent bactericidal effects in terms of augmentation of fish longevity and survival, and reduction of brain microbial loads. Also, S. agalactiae-induced brain oxidative damage that contributed to disease pathogenesis, and the dietary supplementation with nerolidol nanospheres (1.0Â mL/kg diet) prevented this alteration. In summary, nanotechnology is a compelling approach to enhancing the efficacy of nerolidol, giving rise to reduction of S. agalactiae loads in fish brains.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",31982567,

This, in turn, increased concerns regarding human health exposure to microplastics through the consumption of contaminated fish. Most of the available research regarding microplastic toxicity has focused on marine organisms through direct feeding or waterborne exposures at the individual level. However, little is known about the trophic transfer of microplastics through the aquatic food chain. Freshwater zooplankton Daphnia magna (hereafter Daphnia), and the fathead minnow Pimephales promelas (FHM), are well-known model species used in standard toxicological studies and ecological risk assessments that provide a simple model for trophic transfer. The aim of this study was to assess the tissue translocation, trophic transfer, and depuration of two concentrations (20 and 2000-part ml(-1)) of 6Â Î¼m polystyrene (PS) microplastics particles between Daphnia and FHM. Bioconcentration factors (BCF) and bioaccumulation factors (BAF) were determined. Fluorescent microscopy was used to determine the number of particles in the water media and within the organs of both species. Throughout the five days of exposure, PS particles were only found within the GI tract of both species. The BCF for Daphnia was 0.034Â Â±Â 0.005 for the low concentration and 0.026Â Â±Â 0.006 for the high concentration. The BAF for FHM was 0.094Â Â±Â 0.037 for the low concentration and 0.205Â Â±Â 0.051 for the high concentration. Between 72 and 96Â h after exposure all microplastic particles were depurated from both species. The presence of food had a significant effect on the depuration of microplastic particles from Daphnia but not for FHM. Based on the low BCF and BAF values for both species, rapid depuration rates, and null translocation of microplastic particles to organs and tissues from the GI tract, there is a low probability that microplastics will bioconcentrate and bioaccumulate under environmental conditions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome",31952101,

In this study, the overall characterization considered separately plastic microparticles (MPs) from textile microfibers (MFs) which also included natural and semi-synthetic ones. Ingestion of MPs was a widespread phenomenon, but their number (typically 1 or 2) did not reveal any significant relationship with biometric values, geographical areas or ecological features of the species. Conversely, the frequency of ingestion, ranging from 13 to 35% of organisms containing MPs, appeared a more reliable index to highlight such differences, revealing higher values in species from Central and Southern basins compared to the Northern one, as well as in benthopelagic compared to benthic or pelagic organisms. Geographical differences also occurred in terms of size and typology of ingested particles, suggesting the importance of local river runoffs and surface currents dynamics.

Satellite remote sensing images revealed that aquaculture activities were associated with microplastic pollution in sediment, where the microplastics (51-88 items/kg dry weight) were mostly fibres (>94%) and between 500 and 2000Â Âµm. Cellulose was the predominant polymer (60-88% of microplastic composition), followed by polypropylene. Microplastics accumulated in all the commercial species (0.95-2.1 items per individual), where shrimp (Parapenaeopsis hardwickii) had lower potential for microplastic accumulation than the other species. The predominance of fibres and cellulose in the commercial species implies their limited ability to recognize the type and composition of microplastics during ingestion.

This study aims to examine the physiological and behavioral effects caused by fish consuming environmental microplastics at different life stages. MP samples were collected from beaches on three islands (Easter Island, Guam and Hawaii) located near the North and South gyres of the Pacific Ocean. Larvae and juveniles of Japanese Medaka were fed for 30days with three doses of MPs (0.01, 0.1 and 1% w/w in fish food) approximate to the concentrations measured in moderately and heavily contaminated ocean areas. Ingestion of MPs by medaka larvae caused (variously) death, decreased head/body ratios, increased EROD activity and DNA breaks and, alterations to swimming behavior. A diet of 0.1% MPs was the most toxic. Two-month-old juveniles fed with 0.01% MPs did not exhibit any symptoms except an increase in DNA breaks. Our results demonstrate ingestion and mainly sublethal effects of environmental MPs in early life stages of fish at realistic MP concentrations. The toxicity of microplastics varies from one sample to another, depending on polymer composition, weathering and pollutant content.

Microfibres are among the most pervasive pollutants in the marine environment, including in the Southern Ocean. However, evidence for microfibre contamination in the diet of top predators in the Southern Ocean is rare. King Penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) feed on mesopelagic fish, which undergo diel vertical migrations towards the surface at night. Microfibres are concentrated in surface waters and sediments but can also be concentrated in fish, therefore acting as contamination vectors for diving predators feeding at depth. In this study, we investigate microfibre contamination of King Penguin faecal samples collected in February and March 2017 at South Georgia across three groups: incubating, chick-rearing and non-breeding birds. After a KOH digestion to dissolve the organic matter and a density separation step using a NaCl solution, the samples were filtered to collect microfibres. A total of 77% of the penguin faecal samples (36 of 47) contained microfibres. Fibres were measured and characterized using Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy to determine their polymeric identity. Most fibres (88%) were made of natural cellulosic materials (e.g. cotton, linen), with only 12% synthetic (e.g. polyester, nylon) or semi-synthetic (e.g. rayon). An average of 21.9â€¯Â±â€¯5.8 microfibres g(-1) of faeces (lab dried mass) was found, with concentrations more than twice as high in incubating penguins than in penguins rearing chicks. Incubating birds forage further north at the Antarctic Polar Front and travel longer distances from South Georgia than chick-rearing birds. This suggests that long-distance travelling penguins are probably more exposed to the risk of ingesting microfibres when feeding north of the Antarctic Polar Front, which might act as a semi-permeable barrier for microfibres. Microfibres could therefore provide a signature for foraging location in King Penguins.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31726359,

Adult zebrafish have been exposed to two concentrations of high-density polyethylene and polystyrene microplastics for twenty days. Transcriptomic results indicate alterations in the expression of immune system genes and the down-regulation of genes correlated with epithelium integrity and lipid metabolism. The transcriptomic findings are supported by tissue alterations and higher occurrence of neutrophils observed in gills and intestinal epithelium. Even the daily rhythm of activity of zebrafish appears to be affected, although the regular pattern of activity is recovered over time. Considering the transcriptomic and histological findings reported, we hypothesize that the effects on mucosal epithelium integrity and immune response could potentially reduce the organism defense against pathogens, and lead to a different utilization of energy stores.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext",31673028,PMC6823372

Stable cubosome architectures are obtained for several ratios of the lipid ingredients monoolein (MO) and fish oil (FO). The impact of catalase on the structural organization of the cubosome nanocarriers is revealed by the variations of the cubic lattice parameters deduced by BioSAXS. The outcome of the cellular uptake of the dual drug-loaded nanocarriers is assessed by performing a bioassay of catalase peroxidatic activity in lysates of nanoparticle-treated differentiated SH-SY5Y human cells. The obtained results reveal the neuroprotective potential of the in vitro studied cubosomes in terms of enhanced peroxidatic activity of the catalase enzyme, which enables the inhibition of H(2)O(2) accumulation in degenerating neuronal cells.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",31443533,PMC6749324

Imaging observations clearly highlighted the nanoplastics' uptake, showing nanobeads not only in the digestive tract, but also migrating to other tissues through the gut epithelium.

In summary, the effects on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway, disruption of the oogenesis process, and neurotoxicity could be caused by acute exposure of adult zebrafish to microplastics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext,ver se refs da table 1 estão na revisão",31352214,

Because of its enclosed nature, the pollutants entering this water body become entrapped. The present paper examines the influence of human activity and beach morphology on the abundance and distribution of stranded plastic debris along the Caspian Sea coastlines. It would be possible by relating some characteristics of these beaches (population, urbanization, substrate type, and slope of beaches) with the abundance of plastic debris through a PCo analysis. The results showed that in our study area, the most effective factors on plastic debris distribution were urbanization and population followed by the slope and substrate of beaches. Three size classes of plastic debris were defined as ""large microplastic"" (1 to <â€‰5Â mm), ""mesoplastic"" (5 to <â€‰25Â mm), and ""macroplastic"" (>â€‰25Â mm). The density of the large microplastic, mesoplastic, and macroplastic materials on the Caspian Sea coastline was 8.43â€‰Â±â€‰0.54, 8.74â€‰Â±â€‰0.42, and 7.53â€‰Â±â€‰0.30 particles/m(2), respectively.

Microplastic abundance was 0-12.0 items individual(-1) (0-4.7 items g(-1)) in fish and 1.0-44.0 items individual(-1)(0.02-1.3 items g(-1)) in coral. The predominant shape and polymer of microplastics in seawater, fish, and coral were fibrous rayon and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Microplastic sizes primarily ranged from 20-330 Î¼m in both the seawater and fish, while there were relatively more 1-5 mm microplastics in the corals. The shape, size, color, and polymer type distribution patterns of microplastics in seawater more closely resembled those in fish gills than those in fish gastrointestinal tracts or coral samples. This study shows that microplastics are abundant in these coral reef systems and they are captured by fish or ""trapped"" by corals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31204475,

Second, evidence of MP ingestion by their prey species was reviewed. We found common minke whales forage opportunistically on fish from various families: Ammodytidae, Clupeidae, Gadidae, Engraulidae and Osmeridae. Sei whales mostly feed on copepods, Engraulidae, Clupeidae and Scombridae. High levels of MP contamination are reported for Scombridae in the Atlantic and Engraulidae in the Northwest Pacific Ocean.

Methods: White New Zealand rabbits were inoculated with VX2 cells via intra-myometrial injection. At 30 days, Porphysomes were administered intravenously. At 24 h the abdomen was imaged and fluorescent tissue identified (PYRO-FGR). After complete resection of fluorescent tissue, fluorescence-negative lymph nodes and peritoneal biopsies were removed. Histopathology including ultra-staging and analysis by a pathologist was used to detect tumour. Fluorescence signal to background ratio (SBR) was calculated and VX2 (+) tissue compared to VX2 (-) tissue. Biodistribution was calculated and Porphysome accumulation in fluorescent VX2 (+) tissue compared to fluorescent VX2 (-) and non-fluorescent VX2 (-) tissue. Results: Of 17 VX2 models, 10 received 4 mg/kg of Porphysomes and 7 received 1 mg/kg. Seventeen tumours (UT), 81 lymph nodes (LN) and 54 abdominal metastases (AM) were fluorescence-positive and resected. Of these, 17 UT, 60 LN and 45 AM were VX2 (+), while 16 LN and 5 AM were VX2 (-). Nine specimens were excluded from analysis. Thirty-one LN and 53 peritoneal biopsies were fluorescence-negative and resected. Of these, all LN and 51/53 biopsies were VX2 (-) with only 2 false-negative biopsies. Sensitivity and specificity of PYRO-FGR for VX2 (+) tissue was 98.4% / 80.0% overall, 100% / 100% for UT, 100% / 66.0 % for LN and 95.7% / 91.4% for AM.

Biodegradable plastics have gained attentions from the public and the academia to reduce environmental burdens. Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), the simplest and the best-studied bioplastic member of the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family synthesized by many bacteria, has been studied as a feed additive for large yellow croaker fish and weaned piglets. The fish grow faster and gain more weight when 1% and 2% PHB is added as a feed additive, accompanied by increased survival rates. Weaned piglets are found to grow normally and showed no significant change in average daily weight gains, average daily feed intakes, feed efficiency, and organ developments when 0.5% PHB is added to the feed. It can therefore be concluded that biodegradable and biocompatible PHB is not harmful as a feed additive for marine large yellow croakers and sensitive weaned piglets. PHB therefore holds great promise as a plastic that combines biodegradability and biocompatibility with good tolerability as a feed supplement for animals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",31119892,

To date, studies of the occurrence of small molecule (metabolite) coronas are limited. We sought to determine whether a metabolite corona forms on NPs, using high-sensitivity metabolomics combined with a model system for freshwater ecotoxicology (Daphnia magna feeding on Chlorella vulgaris). Using amino-functionalized polystyrene NPs (NH(2)-pNPs), we showed the impact of this material on Daphnia feeding to provide a rationale for the detailed molecular investigations. We then employed a targeted LC-MS/MS approach for sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as an analog to signaling molecules known to occur in our freshwater model system and optimized a corona extraction method for this representative metabolite. Next, we performed an untargeted discovery-based metabolomics study - using high-sensitivity nanoelectrospray direct infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS) - to enable an unbiased assessment of the metabolite corona of NH(2)-pNPs in the freshwater model system. Our results demonstrate that SDS was successfully recovered from NH(2)-pNPs, confirming that the extraction protocol was fit-for-purpose. Untargeted DIMS metabolomics reproducibly detected 100â€‰s of small molecule peaks extracted from NH(2)-pNPs exposed to conditioned media from the D. magna-C. vulgaris model system. Attempts to annotate these extracted metabolites, including by using van Krevelen and Kendrick Mass Defect plots, indicate a diverse range of metabolites that were not clustered into any particular class. Overall we demonstrate the existence of an ecologically relevant metabolite corona on the surface of NPs through application of a high-sensitivity, untargeted mass spectrometry metabolomics workflow.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",31094641,

The post-exposure effects of non-fluorescent PS (10â€¯Î¼m) on the survival, growth and reproduction of medaka larvae were also explored. Results showed that the PS microspheres could be ingested by both larvae and adults during the 48 h-exposure. Notably, feeding status was found to significantly affect the ingestion in medaka adults, which was not observed in the larvae. The egestion process of PS was rapid during the first recovery day but there was still certain percent of particles retained in digestive tracts at the end of 7â€¯d recovery for either larvae or adults. After a 14â€¯d pre-exposure with the non-fluorescent PS microspheres, the subsequent survival, growth and reproduction of medaka larvae were all significantly affected at the end of 120â€¯d of experiment without PS. Overall, these results indicate that fishes might ingest or retain more MPs if the environmental abundance of MPs continues to increase while the available food decreases. Medaka fishes in larval stage have no capacity to select natural food sources like the adults.

MPs were detected in all of the fish species sampled. Overall, 34% (444/1320) of fish retained plastic, and 552 pieces of plastic were removed from these fish, among which 546 pieces (99%) were microplastics (i.e., <5â€¯mm). Three MP types were found: fibers, pellets, and fragments, which accounted for 67%, 22%, and 11% of the total, respectively. MP length ranged from 16 to 4740â€¯Î¼m, with an average of 941â€¯Â±â€¯43â€¯Î¼m.

Fourteen polymers were detected, with organic oxidation polymers (40%) being most abundant, followed by polyethylene (22%) and polyamide (11%). The retention of MPs in fish was affected by sampling areas and fish weight. Fish collected from the area adjacent to the Bohai Sea and the Yangtze River Estuary were found to possess higher levels of MPs than those collected from the center of the Yellow Sea. The average MP/fish for fish with plastic was negatively correlated with fish body weight. The retention of MPs may affect the quality and quantity of fishery resources in the Yellow Sea, especially the commercial fish. It is suggested that future studies be conducted to determine the ingestion rate, retention time, and egestion rate of MPs by fish to enable a rational risk assessment by combining the field results.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30965539,

extracellular vesicles (EVs), a collective term covering various subtypes of cell-released, membranous structures, called exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles, ectosomes, oncosomes, apoptotic bodies, and many other names. However, specific issues arise when working with these entities, whose size and amount often make them difficult to obtain as relatively pure preparations, and to characterize properly. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (""MISEV"") guidelines for the field in 2014. We now update these ""MISEV2014"" guidelines based on evolution of the collective knowledge in the last four years. An important point to consider is that ascribing a specific function to EVs in general, or to subtypes of EVs, requires reporting of specific information beyond mere description of function in a crude, potentially contaminated, and heterogeneous preparation. For example, claims that exosomes are endowed with exquisite and specific activities remain difficult to support experimentally, given our still limited knowledge of their specific molecular machineries of biogenesis and release, as compared with other biophysically similar EVs. The MISEV2018 guidelines include tables and outlines of suggested protocols and steps to follow to document specific EV-associated functional activities. Finally, a checklist is provided with summaries of key points.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30637094,PMC6322352

Our study anticipated to improve the efficacy of Iohexol as a contrast enhancing agent for Computed Tomography, by envisaging bio-compatible albumin based Iohexol nanoparticles. This nanoparticulate system was developed primarily to enhance the anatomic imaging while increasing its residence time in the blood pool. Towards this goal, we developed Iohexol albumin nanoparticles using glutaraldehyde as a cross linking agent, and Polyethylene glyocol Iohexol albumin nanoparticles by physical adsorption to ameliorate its circulation time. These formulations were studied in comparison to the clinically available Iopamidol(â„¢). Both Iohexol albumin nanoparticles and Polyethylene glyocol Iohexol albumin nanoparticles were characterized for its size, physicochemical properties and entrapment efficiency. Iohexol albumin nanoparticles showed a size range of 254Â±5 nm and post surface modification the size of Polyethylene glyocol Iohexol albumin nanoparticles was found to be 283Â±7 nm in diameter, with and entrapment efficiency Iohexol as of 85%. Further, In vivo computed tomography imaging in New Zealand white rabbits for the developed formulations manifested an enhancement in the anatomical structures of heart, liver and kidneys along with an increased residence time in the blood pool of 3 h in contrast to Iopamidol(â„¢). Our study interprets that Polyethylene glyocol Iohexol albumin nanoparticles have prolonged residence time producing much greater conspicuity of anatomic features and warrants further detail study of the formulation in disease models.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",30596547,

Adriamycin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (ADM-NP) were fabricated using a modified emulsification process. Lipid microbubbles (NH(2)-MB) were prepared by mechanical vibration. The carboxyl groups of ADM-NP and NH(2)-MB underwent a condensation reaction after 48 h, and adriamycin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles microbubble complexes (ADM-NMC) were obtained. High-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that the entrapment efficiency and drug loading of ADM-NMC were 85.32 Â± 5.41% and 7.91 Â± 0.27%, respectively. The VX2 liver cancer model was established in 30 New Zealand rabbits, which were subsequently divided into three groups (n=10): a control group that received 5 ml of saline, an ADM-NP group that received 5 ml of ADM-NP and an ADM-NMC group that received 5 ml of ADM-NMC. Rabbits in the ADM-NP and ADM-NMC groups underwent irradiation 120 s with low frequency ultrasound (1 MHz, 0.5 W/cm(2)) for 120 s following injection. The echogenicity of tumors markedly increased following ADM-NP and ADM-NMC treatment. Staining with hematoxylin and eosin demonstrated that the tumor shape became more normal in the ADM-NP and ADM-NMC groups compared with the control group. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting determined that the expression of Bax increased and the expression of Bcl-2 decreased following treatment with ADM-NP and ADM-NMC. Cancer cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and it was determined that apoptosis significantly increased following treatment with ADM-NP and ADM-NMC (P<0.01). Therefore, the present study demonstrated that the use of drug-loaded microbubbles combined with ultrasound may enhance the efficiency of tumor inhibition. This may be due to the promotion of cancer cell apoptosis via regulation of Bax and Bcl-2 expression.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",30578377,PMC6533209

Using the zebrafish embryo as an animal model, we investigated the bioaccumulation and in vivo toxicity of polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics individually or in combination with the Au ion. We showed that smaller PS nanoplastics readily penetrated the chorion and developing embryos and accumulated throughout the whole body, mostly in lipid-rich regions such as in yolk lipids. We also showed that PS nanoplastics induced only marginal effects on the survival, hatching rate, developmental abnormalities, and cell death of zebrafish embryos but that these effects were synergistically exacerbated by the Au ion in a dose- and size-dependent manner. Such exacerbation of toxicity was well correlated with the production of reactive oxygen species and the pro-inflammatory responses synergized by the presence of PS, supporting the combined toxicity of PS and Au ions. The synergistic effect of PS on toxicity appeared to relate to mitochondrial damage as determined by ultrastructural analysis. Taken together, the effects of PS nanoplastics were marginal but could be a trigger for exacerbating the toxicity induced by other toxicants such as metal ions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Correction,QUE: Fulltext,MAT: Correction | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""Completo está no Grupo 1""]}",30534785,

However, the potential toxicity of carbon 60 (C(60)) at the behavioral level has not been properly evaluated. In this study, we used idTracker, a multitracking algorithm to quantitatively assess behavioral toxicity induced by C(60) nanoparticles (C(60) NPs) in adult zebrafish. We demonstrated that locomotion, novel tank exploration, aggression, shoaling, and color preference activities of the C(60) NPs-treated fish was significantly reduced. In addition, the C(60) NPs-treated fish also displayed dysregulation of the circadian rhythm by showing lower locomotion activities in both day and night cycles. The biochemical results showed that C(60) NPs exposure at low concentration induced oxidative stress and DNA damage, reduced anti-oxidative capacity and ATP (adenosine triphosphate) levels, and induced stress-associated hormones, hypoxia, as well as inflammation marker upregulation in muscle and gill tissues. Together, this work, for the first time, provide direct evidence showing that the chronic exposure of C(60) NPs induced multiple behavioral abnormalities in adult zebrafish. Our findings suggest that the ecotoxicity of C(60) NPs towards aquatic vertebrates should be carefully evaluated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",30513951,PMC6321281

Consequently, the availability of microplastics is higher during this time of year in the lower portion of the estuary.

As theranostic nanomedicine is driven by multifunctional therapeutics that aim to achieve targeted tissue delivery and image-guided therapy, fluorescent PS nanoparticle (NP) accumulation in target tissues can be ascertained through fluorescence imaging to optimize the light dose and administration parameters. In this regard, zebrafish larvae provide a unique transparent in vivo platform to monitor fluorescent PS bio-distribution and their therapeutic efficiency.

In this study, abundances and characteristics of microplastics in sediments and benthic organisms from the South Yellow Sea were investigated. First, we optimized the sediment sampling for microplastic analysis and found that the top layer (0-5â€¯cm) had the highest abundance, and microplastic abundances decreased significantly with increase in sediment depth. The abundance of microplastics was 560-4205â€¯n/kg dry weight in the surface sediments (the topmost 3â€¯cm) of 14 sites and 1.7-47.0â€¯n/g wet weight in the tissues of benthic organisms. Moreover, microplastic abundances in sediments and benthic organisms were both positively correlated with water depth. Fibers, transparent microplastics, and small microplastics (<0.5â€¯mm) were the most dominant types in sediments and organisms. FTIR analysis showed that polypropylene (PP, 31%), polyester (PE, 24%), nylon (19%), and polystyrene (PS, 15%) were the most abundant polymers in sediments. The results of SEM showed rough surfaces and obvious cracks on the microplastics isolated from sediments. In addition, characteristics of microplastics in Ophiura sarsii, Crangon affinis, and Acila mirabilis were compared.

The contribution of microplastic ingestion to the overall uptake of five hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) [Î±-, Î²-, and Î³-hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), pentachlorobenzene (PeCB), and hexachlorobenzene (HeCB)] by fish is evaluated in this study. Partition coefficients of all five HOCs between surfactant micelles and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF), as well as between protein and SIF, were experimentally determined. Desorption of model HOCs from a polyethylene film into an artificial gut solution was measured to estimate the fraction of HOCs that can be absorbed from microplastics during their gut retention time. Monte-Carlo simulation (nâ€¯=â€¯100,000) showed that the uptake via microplastic ingestion will be negligible for HCHs as compared to uptake via other exposure routes, water ventilation and food ingestion. On the other hand, microplastic ingestion might increase the total uptake rate of PeCB and HeCB due to their accelerated desorption from microplastics into the artificial gut solution under the model scenario, assuming an extremely high intake of microplastics. However, the steady-state bioaccumulation factor was predicted to decrease with increasing ingestion of microplastics, showing a dilution effect by microplastic ingestion. Results indicate that HOCs that are close to be at phase equilibrium between microplastics and environmental media are not likely to be further accumulated via ingestion of microplastics; this is true even for cases, where ingestion of microplastics contributes significantly to the total uptake of HOCs. Therefore, future studies need to focus on hydrophobic plastic additives that may exist in microplastics at a concentration higher than their equilibrium concentration with water.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",30227286,

Microplastics were spiked with 14 environmentally rare PCBs and incorporated into fish pellets previously spiked with a technical PCB mixture (Aroclor 1254). Five diet treatments were created having microplastic contents of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% and fed to fish within 24 h of the diet creation. Fish from each treatment were fed a microplastic amended food pellet and PCB AEs were determined by mass balance. Microplastic-associated PCBs had lower AEs (geomean 13.36%) compared to food matrix-associated PCBs (geomean 51.64%). There were interactions between PCB AEs and the microplastic content of the diet. PCBs affiliated with microplastics became more bioavailable with increasing microplastic content of food while food matrix-associated PCB bioavailability declined when microplastic contents exceeded 5%. Despite controlling for microplastic-food contact time, there was some evidence for redistribution of lower K(OW) food matrix-associated PCBs onto microplastics causing a decrease in their AE relative to nonplastic and low plastic containing diets. The low bioavailability of microplastic-associated PCBs observed in the present study provides further support to indicate that microplastics are unlikely to increase POPs bioaccumulation by fish in aquatic systems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ?,MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome,3 - Intervention | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""PCBs + MP""]}",30113827,

Rivers are implicated as major pathways of microplastic transport to marine and lake ecosystems, and microplastic ingestion by freshwater biota is a risk associated with microplastic contamination, but there is little research on microplastic ecology within freshwater ecosystems. Microplastic uptake by fish is likely affected by environmental microplastic abundance and aspects of fish ecology, but these relationships have rarely been addressed. We measured the abundance and composition of microplastic in fish and surface waters from 3 major tributaries of Lake Michigan, USA. Microplastic was detected in fish and surface waters from all 3 sites, but there was no correlation between microplastic concentrations in fish and surface waters. Rather, there was a significant effect of functional feeding group on microplastic concentration in fish. Neogobius melanostomus (round goby, a zoobenthivore) had the highest concentration of gut microplastic (19 particles fish(-1)) compared to 10 other fish taxa measured, and had a positive linear relationship between body size and number of microplastic particles. Surface water microplastic concentrations were lowest in the most northern, forested watershed, and highest in the most southern, agriculturally dominated watershed. Results suggest microplastic pollution is common in river food webs and is connected to species feeding characteristics. Future research should focus on understanding the movement of microplastic from point-source and diffuse sources and into aquatic ecosystems, which will support pollution management efforts on inland waters.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30076314,PMC6076259

This study investigated the dietary uptake, and biodistribution and depuration of MPs in the freshwater diving beetle Cybister japonicus (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) after consumption of zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to MPs. The transfer of MPs in diving beetles after consumption of zebrafish was assessed to determine whether the presence of MPs affected diving beetle behavior and predation. We found that diving beetles that consumed MP-exposed fish had a significantly lower ingestion rate than the control. In addition, the trophic transfer rate of MPs was 13-18%. However, MPs were found only in the crop and proventriculus of the beetles, and all particles were depurated within 48â€¯h, likely via regurgitation. As diving beetle is a top predator in freshwater ecosystems and could facilitate transfer from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems via predation, its behavior towards indigestible MPs in its digestive organs (i.e., filtering and vomiting) could represent a meaningful phenomenon as a potential vector for MP transport. This is the first report of the trophic transfer of MPs from fish to dytiscid species, which helps clarify the effects and mechanisms of MPs in freshwater systems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",30036837,

A major cause of MI is fibrin-rich thrombus formation that occludes the coronary arteries, blocking blood flow to the heart and causing fibrin deposition. In treating MI, re-establishing blood flow is critical. However, ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury itself can also occur and contributes to cardiac fibrosis. Fibrin-specific poly( N-isopropylacrylamide) nanogels (FSNs) comprised of a core-shell colloidal hydrogel architecture are utilized in this study to design a dual-delivery system that simultaneously addresses the need to (1) re-establish blood flow and (2) inhibit cardiac fibrosis following I/R injury. These therapeutic needs are met by controlling the release of a fibrinolytic protein, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and a small molecule cell contractility inhibitor (Y-27632). In vitro, tPA and Y-27632-loaded FSNs rapidly degrade fibrin and decrease cardiac cell stress fiber formation and connective tissue growth factor expression, which are both upregulated in cardiac fibrosis. In vivo, FSNs localize to fibrin in injured heart tissue and, when loaded with tPA and Y-27632, showed significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction 2 and 4 weeks post-I/R as well as significantly decreased infarct size, Î±-smooth muscle actin expression, and connective tissue growth factor expression 4 weeks post-I/R.

The present study investigates how combinations of halogenated contaminants and microplastics associated with feed are able to alter toxicokinetics in European seabass and affect the fish. Microplastic particles (2%) were added to the feed either with sorbed contaminants or as a mixture of clean microplastics and chemical contaminants, and compared to feed containing contaminants without microplastics. For the contaminated microplastic diet, the accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in fish was significantly higher, increasing up to 40 days of accumulation and then reversing to values comparable to the other diets at the end of accumulation. The significant gene expression results of liver (cyp1a, il1Î², gstÎ±) after 40 days of exposure indicate that microplastics might indeed exacerbate the toxic effects (liver metabolism, immune system, oxidative stress) of some chemical contaminants sorbed to microplastics. Seabass quickly metabolised BDE99 to BDE47 by debromination, probably mediated by deiodinase enzymes, and unlike other contaminants, this metabolism was unaffected by the presence of microplastics. For the other PCBs and BFRs, the elimination coefficients were significantly lower in fish fed the diet with contaminants sorbed to microplastic compared to the other diets. The results indicate that microplastics affects liver detoxification and lipid distribution, both of which affect the concentration of contaminants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",29573718,

Inspired by the water-resistant adhesion of plant-derived tannins, we herein report a new family of bioadhesives derived from a facile, one-step Michael addition of tannic acid and gelatin under oxidizing conditions and crosslinked by silver nitrate. The oxidized polyphenol groups of tannic acid enable wet tissue adhesion through catecholamine-like chemistry, while both tannic acid and silver nanoparticles reduced from silver nitrate provide antimicrobial sources inherent within the polymeric network. These tannin-inspired gelatin bioadhesives are low-cost and readily scalable and eliminate the concerns of potential neurological effect brought by mussel-inspired strategy due to the inclusion of dopamine; variations in gelatin source (fish, bovine, or porcine) and tannic acid feeding ratios resulted in tunable gelation times (36â€¯s-8â€¯min), controllable degradation (up to 100% degradation within a month), considerable wet tissue adhesion strengths (up to 3.7 times to that of fibrin glue), excellent cytocompatibility, as well as antibacterial and antifungal properties. The innate properties of tannic acid as a natural phenolic crosslinker, molecular glue, and antimicrobial agent warrant a unique and significant approach to bioadhesive design.

Our strategy is new and can be easily extended to other polymer systems, low-cost and readily scalable, and eliminate the concerns of potential neurological effect brought by mussel-inspired strategy due to the inclusion of dopamine. The tannin-inspired gelatin bioadhesives hold great promise for a number of applications in wound closure, tissue sealant, hemostasis, antimicrobial and cell/drug delivery, and would be interested to the readers from biomaterials, tissue engineering, and drug delivery area.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",29555464,PMC6328059

The most consistent effect was a reduction in consumption of natural prey when microplastics were present. For some taxa, negative effects on growth, reproduction and even survival were also evident.

In natura studies face difficulties when dealing with contamination and differentiating between directly and indirectly ingested microplastics. The ethical constraints of subjecting large organisms, such as marine mammals, to laboratory investigations hinder the resolution of these limitations. Here, these issues were resolved by analysing sub-samples of scat from captive grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) and whole digestive tracts of the wild-caught Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) they are fed upon. An enzymatic digestion protocol was employed to remove excess organic material and facilitate visual detection of synthetic particles without damaging them. Polymer type was confirmed using Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Extensive contamination control measures were implemented throughout. Approximately half of scat subsamples (48%; nâ€¯=â€¯15) and a third of fish (32%; nâ€¯=â€¯10) contained 1-4 microplastics. Particles were mainly black, clear, red and blue in colour.

The majority of particles were fibres (75%), with fragments and films also seen (22.7% and 2.3% respectively). Polymers identified were polyethylene, polypropylene and polyester, in addition to a synthetic dye. The maximum number of ingested microplastic particles for individual fish was strongly correlated to exposure (based on distance from the source of the river). Additionally, at a given exposure, the size of fish correlated with the actual quantity of microplastics in the gut. Larger (mainly female) fish were more likely to ingest the maximum possible number of particles than smaller (mainly male) fish. This study is the first to show microplastic ingestion within freshwater fish in the UK and provides valuable new evidence of the factors influencing ingestion that can be used to inform future studies on exposure and hazard of microplastics to fish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",29414339,

Nanoparticles may also be antigenic and toxic to the haematopoietic system, but the immunotoxic effect of Ag NPs on non-target species such as fishes is poorly understood. This study aimed to assess the effect of Ag NP exposure via the water on the haematopoietic system of rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and to determine whether or not the hazard from Ag NPs was different from that of AgNO(3). Fish were exposed for 7 days to a control (dechlorinated Plymouth freshwater), dispersant control, 1Âµgl(-1) Ag as AgNO(3) or 100Âµgl(-1) Ag NPs. Animals were sampled on days 0, 4 and 7 for haematology, tissue trace metal concentration, biochemistry for evidence of oxidative stress/inflammation in the spleen and histopathology of the blood cells and spleen. The Ag NP treatment significantly increased the haematocrit, but the haematological changes were within the normal physiological range of the animal. Thrombocytes in spleen prints at day 4, and melanomacrophage deposits at day 7 in the spleen, of Ag NP exposed-fish displayed significant increases compared to all the other treatments within the time point. A dialysis experiment confirmed that dissolution rates were very low and any pathology observed is likely from the NP form rather than dissolved metal released from it. Overall, the data showed subtle differences in the effects of Ag NPs compared to AgNO(3) on the haematopoietic system. The lack of pathology in the circulating blood cells and melanomacrophage deposits in the spleen suggests a compensatory physiological effort by the spleen to maintain normal circulating haematology during Ag NP exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",29407778,

The NEPs were composed of four matrices (epoxy, polyolefin, polyoxymethylene, and cement) with up to 5% content of three nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes, iron oxide, and organic pigment). Regardless of the type of nanomaterial or matrix used, it was observed that nanomaterials were only partially exposed at the NEP fragment surface, indicating that mostly the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the matrix drove the NEP fragment toxicity. Ecotoxicity in multiple assays was done covering relevant media from terrestrial to aquatic, including sewage treatment plant (biological activity), soil worms (Enchytraeus crypticus), and fish (zebrafish embryo and larvae and trout cell lines). We designed the studies to explore the possible modulation of ecotoxicity by nanomaterial additives in plastics/polymer/cement, finding none. The results support NEPs grouping by the matrix material regarding ecotoxicological effect during the use phase. Furthermore, control results on nanomaterial-free polymer fragments representing microplastic had no significant adverse effects up to the highest concentration tested.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",29376638,

Microplastics were predominantly in sheet and fiber shapes in the lake and river water samples but were more diverse in the lakeshore sediment samples. Polymer types of microplastics were mainly polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) as identified using Raman Spectroscopy. Spatially, microplastic abundance was the highest in the central part of the lake, likely due to the transport of lake current. Based on the higher abundance of microplastics near the tourist access points, plastic wastes from tourism are considered as an important source of microplastics in Qinghai Lake. As an important area for wildlife conservation, better waste management practice should be implemented, and waste disposal and recycling infrastructures should be improved for the protection of Qinghai Lake.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",29353805,

In the trophic transfer test, algae were exposed to 50â€‰mg/L nanoplastics, defined as plastic particles <100â€‰nm in diameter; higher trophic level organisms were exposed through their diet. In the direct exposure test, each species was directly exposed to nanoplastics. Microscopic analysis confirmed that the nanoplastics adhered to the surface of the primary producer and were present in the digestive organs of the higher trophic level species. Nanoplastics also negatively affected fish activity, as measured by distance traveled and area covered, and induced histopathological changes in the livers of fish that were directly exposed. Additionally, nanoplastics penetrated the embryo walls and were present in the yolk sac of hatched juveniles. These observations clearly show that nanoplastics are easily transferred through food chain, albeit because of high experimental dosages.

Persistent organic pollutants and metals have been the co-contaminants majorly investigated in this field. The combined effect of microplastics and sorbed co-contaminants in aquatic organisms still needs to be properly understood. To address this, we have subjected zebrafish to four different feeds: A) untreated feed; B) feed supplemented with microplastics (LD-PE 125-250Âµm of diameter); C) feed supplemented with 2% microplastics to which a mixture of PCBs, BFRs, PFCs and methylmercury were sorbed; and D) feed supplemented with the mixture of contaminants only. After 3 weeks of exposure fish were dissected and liver, intestine, muscular tissue and brain were extracted. After visual observation, evaluation of differential gene expression of some selected biomarker genes in liver, intestine and brain were carried out. Additionally, quantification of perfluorinated compounds in liver, brain, muscular tissue and intestine of some selected samples were performed. The feed supplemented with microplastics with sorbed contaminants produced the most evident effects especially on the liver. The results indicate that microplastics alone does not produce relevant effects on zebrafish in the experimental conditions tested; on the contrary, the combined effect of microplastics and sorbed contaminants altered significantly their organs homeostasis in a greater manner than the contaminants alone.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext",29306661,

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the influence of chitosan-silver nanocomposites on the fish crustacean parasite Lernaea cyprinacea. The disease was detected in goldfish (Carassius auratus) aquaria during the spring. Molecular and morphometric characterizations of the parasite were performed using polymerase chain reaction for rRNA and scanning electron microscopy. Chitosan-silver nanocomposites were characterized using transmission electron microscopy and Zetasizer. Probit analysis of parasite mortality versus the logarithmic concentrations of the composites indicated that the 1h/LC50 was 5.495ppm. Parasites exposed to the chitosan-silver nanocomposites showed severe pathological alterations and adsorbed the composite particles on their cuticles. After aqueous exposure of the infected fish to the compound at its LC50 for 24h, the female lernaeids were completely dislodged. Moreover, the pathological findings indicated rapid skin wound healing and renewal at the parasitic injury site. Therefore, we concluded that chitosan-silver nanocomposites are potential parasitic control agents for ornamental glass aquaria, as they have detrimental effects on aquatic predators, such as copepods.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",29292144,

In this study, juvenile polar cod (Boreogadus saida) were investigated for the presence of plastics in their stomachs. Polar cod is considered a key species in the Arctic ecosystem. The fish were collected both directly from underneath the sea ice in the Eurasian Basin and in open waters around Svalbard. We analysed the stomachs of 72 individuals under a stereo microscope. Two stomachs contained non-fibrous microplastic particles. According to ÂµFTIR analysis, the particles consisted of epoxy resin and a mix of Kaolin with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). Fibrous objects were excluded from this analysis to avoid bias due to contamination with airborne micro-fibres. A systematic investigation of the risk for secondary micro-fibre contamination during analytical procedures showed that precautionary measures in all procedural steps are critical. Based on the two non-fibrous objects found in polar cod stomachs, our results show that ingestion of microplastic particles by this ecologically important fish species is possible. With increasing human activity, plastic ingestion may act as an increasing stressor on polar cod in combination with ocean warming and sea-ice decline in peripheral regions of the Arctic Ocean. To fully assess the significance of this stressor and its spatial and temporal variability, future studies must apply a rigorous approach to avoid secondary pollution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31007367,PMC6445488

To this end, identifying the genes essential for blood vessel formation and elucidating their function are crucial for a complete understanding of angiogenesis. Here, focusing on potential candidate genes for angiogenesis, we performed a morpholino-based genetic screen in zebrafish and identified Cavin-2, a membrane-bound phosphatidylserine-binding protein and critical organizer of caveolae (small microdomains in the plasma membrane), as a regulator of angiogenesis. Using endothelial cells, we show that Cavin-2 is required for in vitro angiogenesis and also for endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. We noted a high level of Cavin-2 expression in the neovascular tufts in the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy, suggesting a role for Cavin-2 in pathogenic angiogenesis. Interestingly, we also found that Cavin-2 regulates the production of nitric oxide (NO) in endothelial cells by controlling the stability and activity of the endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and that Cavin-2 knockdown cells produce much less NO than WT cells. Also, mass spectrometry, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy analyses indicated that Cavin-2 is secreted in endothelial microparticles (EMPs) and is required for EMP biogenesis.

Due to the possible increase in micro- and mesoplastic loads in seafood products over time, the findings of this study suggest their quantification to be included as one of the components of food safety management systems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",28898945,

This study investigated expanded polystyrene (EPS, commonly known as styrofoam) debris, which is a common marine debris item worldwide, and its additive chemical, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD). To obtain a better understanding of chemical dispersion via EPS pollution in the marine environment, intensive monitoring of HBCD levels in EPS debris and microplastics was conducted in South Korea, where EPS is the predominant marine debris originate mainly from fishing and aquaculture buoys. At the same time, EPS debris were collected from 12 other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and HBCD concentrations were measured. HBCD was detected extensively in EPS buoy debris and EPS microplastics stranded along the Korean coasts, which might be related to the detection of a quantity of HBCD in non-flame-retardant EPS bead (raw material). The wide detection of the flame retardant in sea-floating buoys, and the recycling of high-HBCD-containing EPS waste inside large buoys highlight the need for proper guidelines for the production and use of EPS raw materials, and the recycling of EPS waste. HBCD was also abundantly detected in EPS debris collected from the Asia-Pacific coastal region, indicating that HBCD contamination via EPS debris is a common environmental issue worldwide. Suspected tsunami debris from Alaskan beaches indicated that EPS debris has the potential for long-range transport in the ocean, accompanying the movement of hazardous chemicals. The results of this study indicate that EPS debris can be a source of HBCD in marine environments and marine food web.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",28865384,

The equilibrium concentration of HOC in the polymer can be measured and then converted into equilibrium concentrations in other (defined) media, which however requires appropriate polymer to media partition coefficients. We determined thus polymer-lipid partition coefficients (K(PL)) of various PCB, PAH and organochlorine pesticides by equilibration of two silicones and low density polyethylene (LDPE) with fish oil and Triolein at 4Â Â°C and 20Â Â°C. We observed (i) that K(PL) was largely independent of lipid type and temperature, (ii) that lipid diffusion rates in the polymers were higher compared to predictions based on their molecular volume, (iii) that silicones showed higher lipid diffusion and lower lipid sorption compared to LDPE and (iv) that absorbed lipid behaved like a co-solute and did not affect the partitioning of HOC at least for the smaller molecular size HOC. The obtained K(PL) can convert measured equilibrium concentrations in passive sampling polymers into equilibrium concentrations in lipid, which then can be used (1) for environmental quality monitoring and assessment, (2) for thermodynamic exposure assessment and (3) for assessing the linkage between passive sampling and the traditionally measured lipid-normalized concentrations in biota. LDPE-lipid partition coefficients may also be of use for a thermodynamically sound risk assessment of HOC contained in microplastics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",28830066,

In the present study, we determined the bioaccumulation potential of bisphenol A (BPA) in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) in the absence and presence of nano-sized plastic particles (nanoplastics, NPPs). Results show that BPA can accumulate in the viscera, gill, head and muscle of zebrafish with 85, 43, 20, and 3Î¼g/g ww after 1d exposure. NPPs were also found to accumulate in different tissues of the fish. Relative equilibrium was reached after 1d exposure in different tissues with 39 to 636mg/kg ww. Co-exposure of NPPs and BPA led to a 2.2 and 2.6-fold significant increment of BPA uptake in the head and viscera, if compared with BPA alone treatment after 3d exposure. As such, we further investigated several neurotoxic biomarker alterations in the fish head. It was found that either BPA or NPPs can cause myelin basic protein (MBP)/gene up-regulation in the central nervous system (CNS); meanwhile, both contaminants exhibited significant inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, which is a well-known representative biomarker for neurotoxicity. Moreover, for the co-exposure treatment, biomarkers of myeline and tubulin protein/gene expressions, dopamine content, and the mRNA expression of mesencephalic astrocyte derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) were all significantly up-regulated, suggesting that an enhanced neurotoxic effects in both CNS and dopaminergic system occurred. However, AChE activity was no more inhibited in the co-exposure treatment, which implies that solely AChE measurement may not be sufficient to identify neurotoxic effects in the cholinergic system. Overall, the present study demonstrates that the presence of NPPs can increase BPA bioavailability and cause neurotoxicity in adult zebrafish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext",28793400,

Numerous types of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been developed in attempts to achieve this goal. However, LNPs are probably not taken up by target cells because cancer-targeting LNPs are typically modified with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), which inhibits the cellular uptake of LNPs, to passively accumulate in tumor tissue via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. It would clearly be important to develop a LNP with both a prolonged circulation and cancer-specific efficient uptake for use in an innovative nanodrug delivery system. Herein, we assessed the effect of nonstandard macrocyclic peptides against the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) Epi-1, which was discovered by a random nonstandard peptides integrated discovery (RaPID) system, on the cellular uptake and therapeutics delivery of LNPs. A liposomal siRNA delivery system (MEND) was modified with an Epi-1 lipid-derivative (EpCAM-targeting MEND; ET-MEND). The resulting ET-MEND showed a more than 27-fold increase in cellular uptake in EpCAM-positive cell lines. In the case of negative cells, cellular uptake and the efficiency of the ET-MEND for delivering therapeutics were comparable with those of nonmodified MEND. In addition, when systemically injected, the ET-MEND successfully inhibited gene expression in the tumor tissue at a dose of 0.5 mg siRNA/kg without any obvious toxicity. These results suggest that a combination of a specific peptide ligand can be used to identify a RaPID system and that the use of such a MEND for liposomal drug delivery has the potential for use in developing a system for the efficacious delivery of pharmaceuticals to various cancer cells.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ?,MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",28789523,

Optical microscopy enabled morphological classification of the types of particles or fibers present in the sample, as well as the quantification of particle size ranges and fiber lengths. SEM/EDS analysis was used to rule out non-plastic particles and screen the prepared samples for potential microplastic, based on their element signatures and surface characteristics. Chlorinated plastics such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) could be easily identified with SEM/EDS due to their unique elemental signatures including chlorine, as could mineral species that are falsely identified as plastics by optical microscopy. Particle morphology determined by optical microscopy and SEM suggests the fish ingested particles contained both degradation fragments from larger plastic pieces and also manufactured microplastics. SEM images of microplastic particle surfaces revealed characteristic cracks consistent with environmental exposure, as well as pigment particles consistent with manufactured materials. Most of the microplastic surfaces in the fish guts and ocean trawls were covered with biofilms, radiolarians, and crustaceans.

METHODS: White male New Zealand rabbits underwent left thoracotomy with 30-minute temporary left anterior descending artery occlusion and MI confirmed by electrocardiography and histology (MI rabbits, nÂ = 9), or left thoracotomy and pericardial opening for 30 minutes but no left anterior descending artery occlusion (control [C] rabbits, nÂ = 9) rabbits. Following the 30-minute period, a dendrimer (generation 6 dendrimer conjugated to cyanine-5 fluorescent dye [G6-Cy5], 6.7 nm diameter) was administered intravenously and the chest closed in layers. Animals were sacrificed at 3 hours (3 MI, 3 C), 24 hours (3 MI, 3 C), or 48 hours (3 MI, 3 C) postsurgery. RESULTS: As compared to controls, MI rabbits had twofold G6-Cy5 uptake in the myocardial anterior wall as compared to the same region in nonischemic control rabbits at 24 hours postsurgery (6.01 Â± 0.57 Î¼g/g versus 2.85 Â± 0.85 Î¼g/g; pÂ = 0.04).

CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates for the first time that dendrimer nanodevices selectively localize in ischemic as compared to healthy myocardium. This indicates that dendrimer nanodevices are promising agents to deliver drugs specifically to the ischemic myocardium to attenuate the injury.

Maternal exposure to TiO(2)-NPs during developmental period has been associated with hippocampal injury and with a decrease in learning and memory status of the offspring. However, little is known about its injury mechanism. This paper describes the in vivo neurotoxic effects of TiO(2)-NPs on rat offspring hippocampus during developmental period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pregnant and lactating Wistar rats received intragastric TiO(2)-NPs (100mg/kg body weight) daily from gestational day (GD) 2 to (GD) 21 and postnatal day (PD) 2 to (PD) 21 respectively. Animals in the control groups received an equal volume of distilled water via gavage. At the end of the treatment process, offspring were deeply anesthetized and sacrificed. Then brains of each group were collected and sections of the rat offspring's brains were stained using TUNEL staining (for detection of apoptotic cells) and immunostaining (for neurogenesis). Moreover, the right hippocampus (n=6 per each group) were removed from the right hemisphere for evaluating the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 level. RESULTS: Results of histopatological examination by TUNEL staining showed that maternal exposure to TiO(2)-NPs during pregnancy and lactation periods increased apoptotic cells significantly (P<0.01) in the offspring hippocampus. The immunolabeling of double cortin (DCX) protein as neurogenesis marker also showed that TiO(2)-NPs reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the offspring (P<0.05). Moreover, in comparison with the control group, the mRNA levels of Bax and Bcl-2 in the TiO(2)-NPs group significantly increased and decreased, respectively (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: These findings provide strong evidence that maternal exposure to TiO(2)-NPs significantly impact hippocampal neurogenesis and apoptosis in the offspring. The potential impact of nanoparticle exposure for millions of pregnant mothers and their offspring across the world is potentially devastating.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",28254502,

Scutellarin (Scu) turned out to be effective against diabetes related vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. However, its clinical applications have been limited by its low bioavailability. In this study, we formulated and characterized a novel intestinal target nanoparticle carrier based on amphiphilic chitosan derivatives (Chit-DC-VB12) loaded with scutellarin to enhance its bioavailability and then evaluated its therapeutic effect in experimental diabetic retinopathy model. RESULTS: Chit-DC-VB12 nanoparticles showed low toxicity toward the human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells and zebra fish within concentration of 250Â Î¼g/ml, owing to good biocompatibility of chitosan. The scutellarin-loaded Chit-DC-VB12 nanoparticles (Chit-DC-VB12-Scu) were then prepared by self-assembly in aqueous solution. Scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering analysis indicated that the Chit-DC-VB12-Scu nanoparticles were spherical particles in the sizes ranging from 150 to 250Â nm. The Chit-DC-VB12-Scu nanoparticles exhibited high permeation in Caco-2 cell, indicated it could be beneficial to be absorbed in humans. We also found that Chit-DC-VB12 nanoparticles had a high cellular uptake. Bioavailability studies were performed in Sprague-Dawley rats, which present the area under the curve of scutellarin of Chit-DC-VB12-Scu was two to threefolds greater than that of free scutellarin alone. Further to assess the therapeutic efficacy of diabetic retinopathy, we showed Chit-DC-VB12-Scu down-regulated central retinal artery resistivity index and the expression of angiogenesis proteins (VEGF, VEGFR2, and vWF) of retinas in type II diabetic rats. CONCLUSIONS: Chit-DC-VB12 nanoparticles loaded with scutellarin have better bioavailability and cellular uptake efficiency than Scu, while Chit-DC-VB12-Scu nanoparticles alleviated the structural disorder of intraretinal neovessels in the retina induced by diabetes, and it also inhibited the retinal neovascularization via down-regulated the expression of angiogenesis proteins. In conclusion, the Chit-DC-VB12 nanoparticles enhanced scutellarin oral delivery efficacy and exhibited potential as small intestinal target promising nano-carriers for treatment of type II diabetes induced-retinopathy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",28249594,PMC5333415

Understanding the sources, abundance and composition of microplastics present in the environment is a huge challenge due to the fact that hundreds of millions of tonnes of plastic material is manufactured for societal use annually, some of which is released to the environment. The majority of microplastics research to date has focussed on the marine environment. Although freshwater and terrestrial environments are recognised as origins and transport pathways of plastics to the oceans, there is still a comparative lack of knowledge about these environmental compartments. It is highly likely that microplastics will accumulate within continental environments, especially in areas of high anthropogenic influence such as agricultural or urban areas. This review critically evaluates the current literature on the presence, behaviour and fate of microplastics in freshwater and terrestrial environments and, where appropriate, also draws on relevant studies from other fields including nanotechnology, agriculture and waste management. Furthermore, we evaluate the relevant biological and chemical information from the substantial body of marine microplastic literature, determining the applicability and comparability of this data to freshwater and terrestrial systems. With the evidence presented, the authors have set out the current state of the knowledge, and identified the key gaps. These include the volume and composition of microplastics entering the environment, behaviour and fate of microplastics under a variety of environmental conditions and how characteristics of microplastics influence their toxicity. Given the technical challenges surrounding microplastics research, it is especially important that future studies develop standardised techniques to allow for comparability of data. The identification of these research needs will help inform the design of future studies, to determine both the extent and potential ecological impacts of microplastic pollution in freshwater and terrestrial environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",28169032,

Different biomaterials and surgical techniques have been used for this purpose. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite and human freeze-dried bone graft (FDBG) in regeneration of rabbit calvarium bony defects by histologic and histomorphometric evaluation. METHODS: In this experimental study, three similar defects, measuring 8Â mm in diameter, were created in the calvaria of 16 white New Zealand rabbits. Two defects were filled with FDBG and nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite silica gel, while the other one remained unfilled to be considered as control. All the defects were covered with collagen membranes. During the healing period, two animals perished; so 14 rabbits were divided into two groups: half of them were euthanized after 6Â weeks of healing and the other half after 12Â weeks. The specimens were subjected to histologic and histomorphometric examinations for assessment of the following variables: percentage of bone formation and residual graft material, inflammation scores, patterns of bone formation and type of newly formed bone. RESULTS: The percentages of new bone formation after 6Â weeks were 14.22Â Â±Â 7.85, 21.57Â Â±Â 6.91, and 20.54Â Â±Â 10.07% in FDBG, NanoBone, and control defects. These values were 27.54Â Â±Â 20.19, 23.86Â Â±Â 6.27, and 26.48Â Â±Â 14.18% in 12-week specimens, respectively. No significant differences were found in the amount of bone formation between the groups. With regard to inflammation, the control and NanoBone groups showed significantly less inflammation compared to FDBG at the 6-week healing phase (PÂ =Â 0.04); this difference was not significant in the 12-week specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this experimental study, both NanoBone and FDBG exhibited a similar effect on bone formation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",28130564,

Microbeads were obtained from a commercial facial cleanser while microfibers were obtained from washed synthetic textile. Following consumption of the amended pellet, fish were allowed to feed to satiation on non-amended food followed by fasting for periods ranging from 1.5Â h to 6 days. Fish sacrificed at different time points were dissected to remove gut contents and the digesta contents retention and microplastic retention was determined. Although a small number of microplastic particles were retained in fish GI-tracts after 6 days (0-3 particles/50), the retention of microplastics was generally similar to the retention of bulk digesta contents. According to a breakpoint regression model fitted to digesta contents and microplastic particles, the 50% and 90% evacuation times were 10Â h and 33.4Â h, respectively.

Ï‰3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; also known as omega3 fatty acids or fish oil) have beneficial effects against inflammation upon dietary consumption. However, these effects cannot be fully exploited unless diets are enriched with high concentrations of fish oil supplements over long periods of time. Here, a nanomedicine-based approach is presented for delivering effective levels of PUFAs to inflammatory cells. Nanoparticles are internalized by immune cells, and hence can adequately deliver bioactive lipids into these target cells. The Ï‰3 FA docosahexaenoic acid was formulated into liposomes (Ï‰-liposomes), and evaluated for anti-inflammatory effects in different types of immune cells. Ï‰-Liposomes strongly inhibited the release of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species from human neutrophils and murine macrophages, and also inhibited the production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNFÎ± and MCP1. Moreover, Ï‰-liposomes inhibited tumor-cell proliferation when evaluated in FaDu head and neck squamous carcinoma and 4T1 breast cancer cells in in vitro cultures. We propose that Ï‰-liposomes are a promising nanonutraceutical formulation for intravenous delivery of fish oil FAs, which may be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory disorders and cancer.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",27785012,PMC5063558

After acclimatization, groups of wild juveniles were exposed for 96h to artificial salt water (control), microplastics alone (0.184mg/l), cefalexin alone (1.3-10mg/l) and in mixture with microplastics (cefalexin: 1.3-10mg/l; microplastics: 0.184mg/l) at 20 and 25Â°C. Effect criteria were mortality, post-exposure predatory performance (PEPP), acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and lipid peroxidation levels (LPO). At 20Â°C, concentrations of cefalexin aloneâ‰¥5mg/l significantly reduced PEPP (up to 56%; 96h-EC(50)=8.4mg/l), indicating toxicity of the antibiotic to juveniles after short-term exposure to water concentrations in the low ppm range. At 20Â°C, fish exposed to microplastics alone did not have significant differences in any of the parameters tested relative to the control group but tended to have an inhibition of the PEPP (23%) and AChE (21%); at 25Â°C, microplastics alone caused mortality (33%) and PEPP inhibition (28%). Thus, microplastics are toxic to P. microps juveniles. At 20Â°C, under simultaneous exposure to cefalexin and microplastics, the PEPP was significantly reduced (at cefalexin concentrationsâ‰¥1.25mg/l). Moreover, at 25Â°C, the toxicity curves of cefalexin (PEPP based), alone and in mixture with microplastics, were significantly different (p<0.05; 96h-EC(50) of 3.8 and 5.2mg/l, respectively), and the integrated data analysis indicated significant interactions between the two substances for all biomarkers. Thus, the presence of microplastics in the water influenced the toxicity of cefalexin. The rise of water temperature (from 20Â°C to 25Â°C), increased the microplastics-induced mortality (from 8 to 33%), and the inhibitory effects of cefalexin on the PEPP (up to 70%). Significant differences (p<0.05) between the toxicity curves of cefalexin alone at distinct temperatures were found, with a lower 96h-EC(50) at 25Â°C (3.8mg/l) than at 20Â°C (8.4mg/l). Moreover, at 25Â°C, increases of AChE activity (14%) and LPO (72%) in fish exposed to the mixture treatment containing the highest cefalexin concentration were found, and the integrated analysis of data indicated significant interactions between cefalexin and temperature for PEPP, and among all stressors for LPO. Thus, the temperature rise increased the toxicity of microplastics and of cefalexin, alone and in mixture with microplastics, to P. microps juveniles. These findings raise concern on the long-term exposure of wild populations to complex mixtures of pollutants, likely decreasing their fitness, and highlight the need of more research on the combined effects of widely used pharmaceuticals, microplastics and temperature increase on wild species to improve environmental and human risk assessments of chemicals and their safe use under a global warming scenario.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Fulltext,MAT: Correction",27721112,

After 24h of exposure, the animals were removed from the aquarium, the spinal cord was transversely sectioned, and the second gill arch was removed for histological evaluation. Common histological changes included dislocation of the epithelial cells, hyperplasia of the epithelial cells along the secondary lamellae, aneurism, and dilation and disarrangement of the capillaries. All the groups exposed to carbofuran demonstrated a dose-dependent correlation in the Histological Alteration Index; the values found for carbofuran and carbon nanotubes were up to 25% greater than for carbofuran alone. This result indicates an interaction between these toxicants, with enhanced ecotoxic effects. This work contributes to the understanding of the environmental impacts of nanomaterials on aquatic organisms, which is necessary for the sustainable development of nanotechnologies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",27543744,

Therapeutic angiogenesis has emerged as a promising strategy to treat PAD patients because surgical intervention has been showing limited success. Leg muscles of PAD patients have significantly high level of ROS (reactive oxygen species) and the increased production of ROS is a key mechanism of initiation and progression of PAD. We have recently developed H2O2-responsive polymer PVAX, which is designed to rapidly scavenge H2O2 and release vanillyl alcohol with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of PVAX nanoparticles for PAD using a cell culture model and a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia. PVAX nanoparticles significantly enhanced the expression of angiogenic inducers such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). PVAX nanoparticles promoted revascularization and restoration of blood perfusion into ischemic tissues by upregulating angiogenic VEGF and PECAM-1. This work demonstrates that H2O2-responsive PVAX nanoparticles facilitate therapeutic angiogenesis and hold tremendous translational potential as therapeutic systems for ischemic diseases such as PAD.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",27521705,

Cigarettes, including tobacco, marijuana, and electronic nicotine delivery systems are very effective ways to inhale harmful amounts of fine and ultrafine particulate matter. Does size matter? Yes, indeed! The smaller the particle you inhale, the higher the ability to produce reactive oxygen species and to readily access the brain. In this issue of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, Durazzo provides evidence of an association between active cigarette tobacco smoking in cognitively-normal elders and increased cerebral oxidative stress, while in actively smoking Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, the association was also seen with smaller left and total hippocampal volumes. This paper has highly relevant results of interest across the US and the world because millions of people are active smokers and they have other genetic and environmental risk factors that could play a key role in the development/worsening of brain oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Smoking basically anything producing aerosols with particulate matter in the fine and ultrafine size range is detrimental to your brain. Marijuana and e-cigarette use has grown steadily among adolescents and young adults. Smoking-related cerebral oxidative stress is a potential mechanism promoting AD pathology and increased risk for AD. Current knowledge also relates fine and ultrafine particles exposures influencing neurodevelopmental processes in utero. The results from Durazzo et al. should be put in a broader context, a context that includes evaluating the oxidative stress of nano-aerosols associated with cigarette emissions and their synergistic effects with air pollution exposures. AD is expected to increase in the US threefold by the year 2050, and some of these future AD patients are smoking and vaping right now. Understanding the impact of everyday exposures to long-term harmful consequences for brain health is imperative.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",27447427,

To date, a limited number of studies have investigated the level of contamination of marine organisms collected in situ. For extraction and characterization of microplastics in biological samples, the crucial step is the identification of solvent(s) or chemical(s) that efficiently dissolve organic matter without degrading plastic polymers for their identification in a time and cost effective way. Most published papers, as well as OSPAR recommendations for the development of a common monitoring protocol for plastic particles in fish and shellfish at the European level, use protocols containing nitric acid to digest the biological tissues, despite reports of polyamide degradation with this chemical. In the present study, six existing approaches were tested and their effects were compared on up to 15 different plastic polymers, as well as their efficiency in digesting biological matrices. Plastic integrity was evaluated through microscopic inspection, weighing, pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, and Raman spectrometry before and after digestion. Tissues from mussels, crabs and fish were digested before being filtered on glass fibre filters. Digestion efficiency was evaluated through microscopical inspection of the filters and determination of the relative removal of organic matter content after digestion. Five out of the six tested protocols led to significant degradation of plastic particles and/or insufficient tissue digestion. The protocol using a KOH 10% solution and incubation at 60Â Â°C during a 24Â h period led to an efficient digestion of biological tissues with no significant degradation on all tested polymers, except for cellulose acetate. This protocol appeared to be the best compromise for extraction and later identification of microplastics in biological samples and should be implemented in further monitoring studies to ensure relevance and comparison of environmental and seafood product quality studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",27209243,

Liver development and retinal neurodifferentiation were analyzed by whole-mount in situ hybridization, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry, and a behavioral test was performed to track the movement of larvae. We show that exposure of CuO NPs at low doses has little effect on embryonic development. However, exposure to CuO NPs at concentrations of 12.5 mg/L or higher leads to abnormal phenotypes and induces an inflammatory response in a dose-dependent pattern. Moreover, exposure to CuO NPs at high doses results in an underdeveloped liver and a delay in retinal neurodifferentiation accompanied by reduced locomotor ability. Our data demonstrate that short-term exposure to CuO NPs at high doses shows hepatotoxicity and neurotoxicity in zebrafish embryos and larvae.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",27022258,PMC4788362

EW-AgNP showed plasmon resonance reduction in UV-vis spectrophotometry, the functional groups involved in the reduction were studied by FTIR spectroscopy, while particle size and shape was analyzed by FESEM. The effect of EW-AgNP on in vitro HepG2 cell proliferation was measured using MTT assays. Apoptosis assessed by flow cytometry showed diminished endurance of HepG2 cells and cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. EW-AgNP were toxic to Anopheles stephensi larvae and pupae, LC(50) were 4.8 ppm (I), 5.8 ppm (II), 6.9 ppm (III), 8.5 ppm (IV), and 15.5 ppm (pupae).

EW-AgNP IC(50) were 49.3 Î¼g/ml (CQ-s) and 55.5 Î¼g/ml (CQ-r), while chloroquine IC(50) were 81.5 Î¼g/ml (CQ-s) and 86.5 Î¼g/ml (CQ-r). EW-AgNP showed a valuable antibiotic potential against important pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Concerning non-target effects of EW-AgNP against mosquito natural enemies, the predation efficiency of the mosquitofish Gambusia affinis towards the II and II instar larvae of A. stephensi was 68.50% (II) and 47.00% (III), respectively. In EW-AgNP-contaminated environments, predation was boosted to 89.25% (II) and 70.75% (III), respectively.

Titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) nanoparticles are widely used as food additives or in pharmaceutical formulations and are consumed by millions of people on a daily basis. We investigated the effects of TiO(2) in the development of colitis and the role of the nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain receptor, pyrin domain containing (NLRP)3 inflammasome. DESIGN: Wild-type and NLRP3-deficient mice with dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis were orally administered with TiO(2) nanoparticles. The proinflammatory effects of TiO(2) particles in cultured human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and macrophages were also studied, as well as the ability of TiO(2) crystals to traverse IEC monolayers and accumulate in the blood of patients with IBD using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Oral administration of TiO(2) nanoparticles worsened acute colitis through a mechanism involving the NLRP3 inflammasome. Importantly, crystals were found to accumulate in spleen of TiO(2)-administered mice. In vitro, TiO(2) particles were taken up by IECs and macrophages and triggered NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1 assembly, caspase-1 cleavage and the release of NLRP3-associated interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-18. TiO(2) also induced reactive oxygen species generation and increased epithelial permeability in IEC monolayers. Increased levels of titanium were found in blood of patients with UC having active disease. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that individuals with a defective intestinal barrier function and pre-existing inflammatory condition, such as IBD, might be negatively impacted by the use of TiO(2) nanoparticles.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",26848183,PMC5530483

The most effective way to counter cardiovascular complications is early diagnosis and the safest non-invasive diagnostic approach is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, superparamagnetic ferrite nanoparticles doped with zinc, exhibiting highly enhanced saturation magnetization and T2 and computed tomography (CT) contrast were synthesized. These nanoparticles have been strategically engineered using bovine lactoferrin (Lf), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and heat shock protein (Hsp)-70 antibody specifically targeting atherosclerosis with potential therapeutic value. The nanocomplexes were further validated in vitro to assess their cytotoxicity, internalization efficiency, effects on cellular proliferation and were assessed for MRI as well as X-ray CT in ex vivo Psammomys obesus rat model. RESULTS: Optimized zinc doped ferrite nanoparticles (Zn0.4Fe2.6O4) with enhanced value of maximum saturation magnetization value on 108.4Â emu/g and an average diameter of 24Â Â±Â 2Â nm were successfully synthesized. Successfully incorporation with bovine lactoferrin, PEG and Hsp-70 (70Â kDa) antibody led to synthesis of spherical nanocomplexes (size 224.8Â nm, PDI 0.398). A significantly higher enhancement in T2 (pÂ <Â 0.05, 1.22-fold) and slightly higher T1 (1.09-fold) and CT (1.08-fold) contrast compared to commercial ferrite nanoparticles was observed. The nanocomplexes exhibited effective cellular internalization within 2Â h in both THP-1 and Jurkat cells. MRI scans of contrast agent injected animal revealed significant arterial narrowing and a significantly higher T2 (pÂ <Â 0.05, 1.71-fold) contrast in adult animals when compared to juvenile and control animals. The excised heart and aorta agar phantoms exhibited weak MRI contrast enhancement in juvenile animal but significant contrast enhancement in adult animal specifically at the aortic arch, descending thoracic aorta and iliac bifurcation region with X-ray CT scan. Histological investigation of the contrast agent injected aorta and heart confirmed site target-specific accumulation at the atherosclerotic aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta of the adult animal with severely damaged intima full of ruptured microatheromas.

While the mortality rate increased significantly with the amount of microbeads scored per larvae at 14 and 20 dph, only ingestion of the highest concentration slightly impacted mortality rates. Larval growth and inflammatory response through Interleukine-1-beta (IL-1Î²) gene expression were not found to be affected while cytochrome-P450-1A1 (cyp1a1) expression level was significantly positively correlated with the number of microbeads scored per larva at 20 dph. Overall, these results suggest that ingestion of PE microbeads had limited impact on sea bass larvae possibly due to their high potential of egestion.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""Matheus""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext",26412109,

Following exposure for 4 h, 4 days, or 4 days plus a 7 day depuration period, we obtained different toxicokinetic profiles for different particle sizes, as determined by Ag content of the tissues. Ionic AgNO3 served as a positive control. The gills showed a significantly higher Ag content for the 20 nm particles at 4 h and 4 days than the 110 nm particles, while the values were more similar in the intestines. Both particle types were retained in the intestines even after depuration. These toxicokinetics were accompanied by striking size-dependent differences in the ultrastructural features and histopathology in the target organs in response to the particulates. Ag staining of the gills and intestines confirmed prominent Ag deposition in the basolateral membranes for the 20 nm but not for the 110 nm particles. Furthermore, it was possible to link the site of tissue deposition to disruption of the Na(+)/K(+) ion channel, which is also localized to the basolateral membrane. This was confirmed by a reduction in ATPase activity and immunohistochemical detection of the Î± subunit of this channel in both target organs, with the 20 nm particles causing significantly higher inhibition and disruption than the larger size particles or AgNO3. These results demonstrate the importance of particle size in determining the hazardous impact of AgNPs in the gills and intestines of adult zebrafish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",26327297,

The UV blocking efficacy of ZnO nanoparticles is lost due to photocatalysis. To isolate a lower toxic species of sunblockers, ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized and coated with chitosan - a natural polymer (ZnO-CTS) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) - a synthetic polymer (ZnO-PEG). Coating with CTS and PEG circumvented the photocatalytic activity, increased the stability and improved the UV absorption efficacy. The effect of ZnO, ZnO-CTS and ZnO-PEG nanoparticles in vivo on zebrafish embryo revealed lower deposition of ZnO-CTS and ZnO-PEG nanoparticles atop the eggs compared to ZnO. The survival of zebrafish embryos was always found to be higher in case of ZnO-CTS with respect to ZnO-treated ones. PEG coating exhibited better UV attenuation, but, in vivo it induced delayed hatching. Thus, one of the reasons for better survival could be attributed to lower aggregation of ZnO-CTS nanoparticles atop eggs thereby facilitating the breathing of embryos.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",26249620,

We have previously reported that Sr addition in apatite/polylactide composites could enhance the BMP-induced bone formation around implants at ectopic site in healthy animals. In this study we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Sr addition on the local bone formation in osteoporosis. Apatite/polylactide composite granules with different Sr content were loaded with equal amount of rhBMP-2 and implanted intramuscularly in healthy rabbits (Con) and rabbits that received bilateral ovariectomy and daily injection of glucocorticoid (OP) for 12 weeks. The potential effect of Sr on the final volume of BMP-induced bone in both groups was investigated histologically and histomorphometrically. The de novo bone formed in OP implants was significantly less than in Con group when the implants contained no Sr, indicating that the BMP-induced osteogenesis was impaired in OP animals. Sr substitution as low as 0.5 mol% in apatite increased the bone volume in OP implants to levels comparable to that in the Con group, indicating a positive effect of Sr addition on the local bone formation in OP animals. In addition, more adipose tissue formed in parallel with the appearance of cartilage tissue in OP implants, suggesting that the differentiation potential of stem cell in OP animals may have shifted towards adipogenesis and chondrogenesis. From these results, we conclude that the use of Sr addition to enhance the bone growth surrounding implants in osteoporosis merits further study. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The impaired bone healing capacity of osteoporotic patients might result in poor osteointegration and surgical failure in case implants are placed. In this study we aimed to enhance the bone formation around implants under such scenario by adding strontium as the stimulus. Different from other studies, the samples were loaded with rhBMP-2 and implanted at an ectopic site (spinal muscles of New Zealand rabbits) to exclude the influence of conductive bone repair. The results showed that the addition of strontium could enhance the BMP-2-induced bone formation on implants in osteopenic rabbits to levels comparable to that in healthy rabbits. Secondarily, we observed more adipose tissue and cartilage tissue in osteopenic implants, suggesting the role of adipogenesis and chondrogenesis in osteopenia/osteoporosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",26234489,

After that, the capture probe and tracers were connected through a hybridization reaction between s-DNA and aptamers. In the presence of CAP and PCB72, the analytes could react with the aptamers on capture probes and release the tracers into supernatant after magnetic separation. The released tracers with metal ions (Cd(2+) and Pb(2+)) could be simultaneously detected through the square wave voltammetry (SWV) without acid dissolution, which can switch the signals of the biosensor to ""on'' state. Under optimal conditions, the assay could detect CAP and PCB72 as low as 0.3 pg mL(-1) with the dynamitic range from 0.001 to 100 ng mL(-1) and exhibited excellent selectivity.

The study has demonstrated an enhanced anticancer activity of the conjugate, and conjugate loaded stealth HSA nanoparticles (NPs) in comparison to the free drug in A-549 human lung carcinoma cell line and Zebra fish embryos (Danio rerio). Hydrolysability of the conjugate has also been demonstrated with complete hydrolysis being observed after 12 h.

The other parameters evaluated were particle size (86nm), Poly Dispersive Index (PDI) (0.209), zeta potential (-49mV), drug entrapment efficiency (96.73%) and drug loading efficiency (89%). Being in stealth mode gives the potential for the NPs to evade Reticulo-Endothelial system (RES), achieve passive targeting by Enhanced Permeation Retention (EPR) effect with controlled release of the therapeutic agent.

Unlike conventional polycation-based systems, decationized polyplexes are based on hydrophilic and neutral polymers. They are obtained by a 3-step process: charge-driven condensation followed by disulfide crosslinking stabilization and finally polyplex decationization. They consist of a disulfide-crosslinked poly(hydroxypropyl methacrylamide) (pHPMA) core stably entrapping plasmid DNA (pDNA), surrounded by a shell of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). In the present paper the applicability of decationized polyplexes for systemic administration was evaluated. Cy5-labeled decationized polyplexes were evaluated for stability in plasma by fluorescence single particle tracking (fSPT), which technique showed stable size distribution for 48 h unlike its cationic counterpart. Upon the incubation of the polymers used for the formation of polyplexes with HUVEC cells, MTT assay showed excellent cytocompatibility of the neutral polymers. The safety was further demonstrated by a remarkable low teratogenicity and mortality activity of the polymers in a zebrafish assay, in great contrast with their cationic counterpart. Near infrared (NIR) dye-labeled polyplexes were evaluated for biodistribution and tumor accumulation by noninvasive optical imaging when administered systemically in tumor bearing mice. Decationized polyplexes exhibited an increased circulation time and higher tumor accumulation, when compared to their cationic precursors. Histology of tumors sections showed that decationized polyplexes induced reporter transgene expression in vivo. In conclusion, decationized polyplexes are a platform for safer polymeric vectors with improved biodistribution properties when systemically administered.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ?,MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",25204289,PMC4254847

One of the main problems in controlling the disease is the low efficacy of the Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) vaccine in protecting young adults. The development of new vaccines that induce a long-lasting immune response or that stimulate the immunity induced by BCG may improve the control of tuberculosis. METHODS: The use of microstructured liposomes containing HspX, with or without MPL or CpG DNA adjuvants, as vaccines for tuberculosis was evaluated. The HspX-specific humoral and cellular immune responses to the different vaccine formulations were compared. RESULTS: All vaccines containing liposome microparticles and HspX were immunogenic. Vaccines formulated with CpG DNA and HspX induced the strongest humoral and cellular immune responses, mainly by inducing interferon-Î³ and tumor necrosis factor-Î± expression by both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. HspX and MPL mainly induced CD8(+) T-cell activation and specific humoral responses. When evaluated the protective efficacy of the formulations against Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge, the microstructured liposome containing L-HspX and L-HspX-CPG DNA reduced both lung inflammatory lesions and the bacterial load. CONCLUSION: We have thus demonstrated, for the first time, the use of microstructured liposomes as an adjuvant and delivery system for a vaccine formulation against tuberculosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,3 - Intervention",24951861,

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that human-derived NPs could worsen the response to arterial endothelial injury and induce vascular calcification. METHODS: The right carotid artery of 24 New Zealand rabbits was injured with an angioplasty balloon. Animals were perfused intravenously with saline (100 mL) during the experiment and divided into three groups: group-A, control; group-B, exposed to NPs (2 mL) obtained from calcified aortic valves; and group-C, exposed to NPs (2 mL) and treated postoperatively with atorvastatin (2.5 mg/kg/24 h). At 30 days, both carotid arteries were removed and examined histologically. Blood measurements were monitored during the study. RESULTS: The intimal hyperplasia area was significantly larger in the injured right carotid artery compared with the left unoperated carotid artery in all groups. There was no significant variation in medial area between groups. Morphometrically, the intima/media ratio (IMR) was significantly higher in damaged carotids compared with controls. A significant increase of IMR was found in group-B (1.81 Â± 0.41) compared with group-A (0.38 Â± 0.59; p = .004) or group-C (0.89 Â± 0.79; p = .035). Differences between groups C and A were not significant (p = .064). Calcifications were observed in six animals, all of which had been exposed to NPs (4 in group-B, 2 in group-C, p = .027). Plasma levels of cholesterol and triglycerides remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: This research confirms the ability of systemic inoculation of human-derived NPs to accelerate hyperplasia and stimulate calcification in localized areas of arteries previously submitted to endothelial damage, while it was harmless in healthy arteries. Atorvastatin was demonstrated to slow down this process.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",24725966,

Information is missing concerning the influence of nanomaterials on the overall reproductive outcome and transgenerational effects in animals and plants. To obtain this information, long-term studies would be required using animal models phylogenetically close to humans and exposure conditions that reflect realistic scenarios with regard to dosages and admission. The nanoreprotoxicology literature published to date is largely descriptive in nature regarding the effects of nanoparticles. The mechanisms, which determine particle reproduction compatibility, are mostly elusive at the moment. Thus, it is recommended that future research explore the interactions between nanomaterials and transgenerational matter on a molecular level. It would, for instance, be of major importance to understand the behaviour of nanoparticles inside the cells but also their genotoxic and epigenetic effects. Recent studies have shown that intravenous and/or intra-abdominal administration of nanoparticles to mice results in their accumulation in the cells of many tissues, including the brain and the testis, suggesting that they easily pass through the blood-brain and blood-testis barriers. In parallel embryo development after exposure to nanoparticles should be comparatively investigated. The majority of studies on embryo toxicology have concentrated on piscine embryos, mostly derived from zebrafish.

The presence of plastic microscopic particles in fish and marine wildlife is massive and well documented, but its impact on cellular activity is not understood. Biological activity generally requires interaction with biological membranes, but this is difficult to study at the molecular scale in vivo. Here we use coarse-grained molecular simulations to determine the effect of nanosized polystyrene (PS) particles on the properties of model biological membranes. We find that PS nanoparticles permeate easily into lipid membranes. Dissolved in the membrane core, PS chains alter membrane structure, significantly reduce molecular diffusion, and soften the membrane. Moreover, PS severely affects membrane lateral organization by stabilizing raft-like domains. Changes in membrane properties and lateral organization can severely affect the activity of membrane proteins and thereby cellular function.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",26276207,

Here, so-called microplastics (MP), fragments smaller than 5Â mm, are of special concern because they can be ingested throughout the food web more readily than larger particles. Focusing on freshwater MP, we briefly review the state of the science to identify gaps of knowledge and deduce research needs. STATE OF THE SCIENCE: Environmental scientists started investigating marine (micro)plastics in the early 2000s. Today, a wealth of studies demonstrates that MP have ubiquitously permeated the marine ecosystem, including the polar regions and the deep sea. MP ingestion has been documented for an increasing number of marine species. However, to date, only few studies investigate their biological effects. The majority of marine plastics are considered to originate from land-based sources, including surface waters. Although they may be important transport pathways of MP, data from freshwater ecosystems is scarce. So far, only few studies provide evidence for the presence of MP in rivers and lakes. Data on MP uptake by freshwater invertebrates and fish is very limited. KNOWLEDGE GAPS: While the research on marine MP is more advanced, there are immense gaps of knowledge regarding freshwater MP. Data on their abundance is fragmentary for large and absent for small surface waters. Likewise, relevant sources and the environmental fate remain to be investigated. Data on the biological effects of MP in freshwater species is completely lacking. The accumulation of other freshwater contaminants on MP is of special interest because ingestion might increase the chemical exposure. Again, data is unavailable on this important issue. CONCLUSIONS: MP represent freshwater contaminants of emerging concern. However, to assess the environmental risk associated with MP, comprehensive data on their abundance, fate, sources, and biological effects in freshwater ecosystems are needed. Establishing such data critically depends on a collaborative effort by environmental scientists from diverse disciplines (chemistry, hydrology, ecotoxicology, etc.) and, unsurprisingly, on the allocation of sufficient public funding.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",28936382,PMC5566174

This has been crosslinked using bifunctional (ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate) and tetrafunctional (pentaerythritol tetraacrylate) crosslinkers in varied concentrations (10-90%) to result in a polymeric network. The crosslinked polymers thus obtained were characterized by spectroscopic techniques (NMR and FTIR) and then prepared nanoparticles by the nanoprecipitation technique. Particle size analysis showed sizes of ~150 nm (PDIâ€‰<â€‰1) (with tetrafunctional crosslinker) and ~300 nm (with bifunctional crosslinker). Both the systems however showed unimodal narrow particle size distributions with negative zeta potential values of -15.6 and -7.3 respectively.

Mortality, hatching rate, malformation and whole-embryo cellular death were detected. We also measured the larval behavior to analyze whether SiNPs had adverse effects on larvae locomotor activity. The results showed that as the exposure dosages increasing, the hatching rate of zebrafish embryos was decreased while the mortality and cell death were increased. Exposure to SiNPs caused embryonic malformations, including pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, tail and head malformation. The larval behavior testing showed that the total swimming distance was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The lower dose (25 and 50 Âµg/mL SiNPs) produced substantial hyperactivity while the higher doses (100 and 200 Âµg/mL SiNPs) elicited remarkably hypoactivity in dark periods.

METHODS: In total, 33 rabbits were used in studies A through C. A. IVD cells were sorted; fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) by size (forward scatter; â‰¤ 10 Î¼m or >10 Î¼m or GDF5+ cells (anti-GDF5 antibody). Sorted cells, labeled with cell tracer (carboxyfluorescein-diacetate-succinimidyl ester; CDFA-SE) were applied on IVD explants in vitro. Migrating cells/distance was evaluated by fluorescence- and confocal-microscopy (FC). B. DNA labeling was performed with BrdU (oral administration). Animals were killed (14 to 56 days), KJs collected, and BrdU+ cells visualized with immunohistochemistry (IHC)/anti-BrdU antibody in SN and articular cartilage (AC). C. Cell tracer: (Fe-nanoparticles: Endorem) were injected into SNs of IVDs (LI-LV) and KJs (tibia). Animals were killed after 2 to 6 weeks. Fe-labeled cells were traced by ferric-iron staining (Prussian blue reaction; Mallory method). RESULTS: A. GDF5+ cells and â‰¤ 10-Î¼m cells displayed the best migration capability in IVD explants. GDF5+ cells were detected at a tissue depth of 1,300 Î¼m (16 days). B. BrdU+ cells were observed in early time points in niches of KJs, and at later time points in AC, indicating a gradual migration of cells. C.

In the potential migration route (PMR), from niches toward the IVD, Fe+ cells (three of 12 animals) and in PMR toward AC (KJs) (six of 12 animals) were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate similar cellular migration patterns in cartilage regions (IVD and KJs) with migration from stem cell niche areas into the mature cartilaginous tissues of both the KJs and the IVD. These findings of a cellular migration pattern in mature cartilage are of interest from tissue-repair and engineering perspectives.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",24004687,PMC3854713

However, between 10 and 30% of all platelet transfusions are clinically ineffective as measured by corrected count increments, but no test is currently used to identify and avoid these transfusions. ThromboLUX(Â®) is the first platelet test intended to routinely characterize platelet concentrates prior to transfusion. METHODS: ThromboLUX is a non-invasive, optical test utilizing dynamic light scattering to characterize a platelet sample by the relative quantity of platelets, microparticles, and other particles present in the sample. ThromboLUX also determines the response of platelets to temperature changes. From this information the ThromboLUX score is calculated. Increasing scores indicate increasing numbers of discoid platelets and fewer microparticles. ThromboLUX uses calibrated polystyrene beads as a quality control standard, and accurately measures the size of the beads at multiple temperatures. RESULTS: Results from apheresis concentrates showed that ThromboLUX can determine the microparticle content in unmodified samples of platelet concentrates which correlates well with the enumeration by flow cytometry.

A total of 18 cylinder-shaped PEEK implants were inserted in the femurs of nine New Zealand rabbits; half were coated with nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (nanoHA) and half were uncoated controls. Healing time was 6 weeks. Samples were retrieved with the implant and surrounding tissue, processed to cut and ground sections, and analyzed histomorphometrically. The implant surfaces were analyzed with optical interferometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). NanoHA-coated PEEK surfaces had lower height deviation (Sa) than controls [mean Â± SD: 0.41 Î¼m (Â± 0.14) vs. 0.96 Î¼m (Â± 0.28)]. SEM images showed the nanoHA crystals as a thin layer on the polymer surface. XPS analysis of the coated implants showed a Ca/P ratio of 1.67. Histomorphometry indicated that the nanoHA-coated implants had more bone-to-implant contact [16% (Â± 4.7) vs. 13% (Â± 9.3)] and more bone area [52% (Â± 9.5) vs. 45% (Â± 11.9)]. We found no difference between smooth nanoHA-coated cylinder-shaped PEEK implants and uncoated controls. However, higher mean bone-to-implant contact indicated better osseointegration in the coated implants than in the uncoated controls.

They potentially can enhance the benefits that both medical and scientific technology will bestow to humankind. However, it has now been several decades since the use of plastics exploded, and we have evidence that our current approach to production, use, transport and disposal of plastic materials has caused, and is still causing serious effects on wildlife, and is not sustainable. Because of frequent inappropriate waste management practices, or irresponsible human behavior, large masses of plastic items have been released into the environment, and thereby have entered the world's oceans. Moreover, this process continues, and in some places is even increasing. Most plastic debris that now exists in the marine environment originated from ocean-based sources such as the fishing industry. Plastics accumulate in coastal areas, at the ocean surface and on the seabed. Because 70% of all plastics are known to eventually sink, it is suspected that ever increasing amounts of plastic items are accumulating in seabed sediments. Plastics do not biodegrade, although, under the influence of solar UV radiations, plastics do degrade and fragment into small particles, termed microplastics. Our oceans eventually serve as a sink for these small plastic particles and in one estimate, it is thought that 200,000 microplastics per km(2) of the ocean's surface commonly exist. The impact of plastic debris has been studied since the beginning of the 1960's. To date, more than 267 species in the marine environment are known to have been affected by plastic entanglement or ingestion. Marine mammals are among those species that are most affected by entanglement in plastic debris. By contrast, marine birds suffer the most from ingestion of plastics. Organisms can also be seriously absorbed by floating plastic debris, or the contaminants may derive from plastic additives that are leached to the environment. Recent studies emphasize the important role of microplastics as they are easily ingestible by small organisms, such as plankton species, and form a pathway for contaminants to enter the food web. Contaminants leached from plastics tend to bioaccumulate in those organisms that absorb them, and chemical concentrations are often higher at higher trophic levels. This causes a threat to the basis of every food web and can have serious and far-reaching effects, even on nonmarine species such as polar bears and humans, who consume marine-grown food. Therefore, resolving the plastic debris problem is important to human kind for two reasons: we are both creator, and victim of the plastic pollution problem. Solutions to the plastic debris problem can only be achieved through a combination of actions. Such actions include the following: Legislation against marine pollution by plastics must be enforced, recycling must be accentuated, alternatives (biodegradable) to current plastic products must be found, and clean-up of debris must proceed, if the marine plastic pollution problem is to eventually be resolved. Governments cannot accomplish this task on their own, and will need help and initiative from the public. Moreover, resolving this long-standing problem will require time, money, and energy from many individuals now living and those of future generations, if a safer and cleaner marine environment is to be achieved.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",22610295,

To achieve optimal bioavailability and control their fast rate of absorption, peptides can be protected by coprocessing with polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG). Here, we formulated and characterized salmon calcitonin (sCT)-loaded microparticles using linear or branched PEG (L-PEG or B-PEG) and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPÎ²CD) for pulmonary administration. Mixtures of sCT, L-PEG or B-PEG and HPÎ²CD were co-spray dried. Based on the particle properties, the best PEG:HPÎ²CD ratio was 1:1 w:w for both PEGs. In the sCT-loaded particles, the L-PEG was more crystalline than B-PEG. Thus, L-PEG-based particles had lower surface free energy and better aerodynamic behavior than B-PEG-based particles. However, B-PEG-based particles provided better protection against chemical degradation of sCT. A decrease in sCT permeability, measured across Calu-3 bronchial epithelial monolayers, occurred when the PEG and HPÎ²CD concentrations were both 1.6 wt %. This was attributed to an increase in buffer viscosity, caused by the two excipients. sCT pharmacokinetic profiles in Wistar rats were evaluated using a 2-compartment model after iv injection or lung insufflation. The maximal sCT plasma concentration was reached within 3 min following nebulization of sCT solution. L-PEG and B-PEG-based microparticles were able to increase T(max) to 20 Â± 1 min and 18 Â± 8 min, respectively.

Previous studies have demonstrated some consequences of nanosilver exposure for earlier life stages of aquatic organisms, but few focus on the effects on metabolic processes such as oxygen consumption. Additionally, few authors have tackled the issue of how size, shape and composition of nanosilver particles are important in determining their level of bioactivity and biodistribution in the aquatic environment. In this study, embryos of the zebra fish, Danio rerio, (n = 2373) were exposed to varying concentrations of two Ag particle sizes, 12 and 21 nm, at time points 24 and 48 h after fertilization. The 12 nm particles were found to be more bioactive with a lethal dose 50 (LD(50)) concentration of 15.8 Î¼g/mL compared to 50.1 Î¼g/mL for 21 nm particles. The effective dose level (ED) was measured as 12.6 Î¼g/mL for the 12 nm particles and 5.0 Î¼g/mL for the 21 nm particles. Using survival curves, we found that in terms of number of particles in suspension, 21 nm particles have a greater impact on survival than 12 nm particles. Our measured respiration rates for 24 and 48 h embryos (n = 528) exposed to 0 0.02-0.14 mg/mL Ag showed no active upregulation of an energetically expensive detoxification pathway at this early point in development. Results from this study illustrate that advancements in the development of environmentally friendly nanoparticles can only occur if there is continued research to identify the most bioactive characteristics of these metallic particles.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",21806456,

Autologous DPSCs were isolated from rabbit dental pulp tissue and expanded ex vivo to enrich DPSCs numbers, and then their attachment and differentiation capability were evaluated when cultured on the culture plate or nHAC/PLA. The alveolar bone defects were treated with nHAC/PLA, nHAC/PLA+rhBMP-2, nHAC/PLA+DPSCs, nHAC/PLA+DPSCs+rhBMP-2, and autogenous bone (AB) obtained from iliac bone or were left untreated as a control. X-ray and a polychrome sequential fluorescent labeling were performed postoperatively and the animals were sacrificed 12 weeks after operation for histological observation and histomorphometric analysis. Our results showed that DPSCs expressed STRO-1 and vementin, and favored osteogenesis and adipogenesis in conditioned media. DPSCs attached and spread well, and retained their osteogenic phenotypes on nHAC/PLA. The rhBMP-2 could significantly increase protein content, alkaline phosphatase activity/protein, osteocalcin content, and mineral formation of DPSCs cultured on nHAC/PLA. The X-ray graph, the fluorescent, histological observation, and histomorphometric analysis showed that the nHAC/PLA+DPSCs+rhBMP-2 tissue-engineered bone complex had an earlier mineralization and more bone formation inside the scaffold than nHAC/PLA, nHAC/PLA+rhBMP-2, and nHAC/PLA+DPSCs, or even autologous bone. Implanted DPSCs' contribution to new bone was detected through transfected eGFP genes. Our findings indicated that stem cells existed in adult rabbit dental pulp tissue. The rhBMP-2 promoted osteogenic capability of DPSCs as a potential cell source for periodontal bone regeneration. The nHAC/PLA could serve as a good scaffold for autologous DPSC seeding, proliferation, and differentiation. The tissue-engineered bone complex with nHAC/PLA, rhBMP-2, and autologous DPSCs might be a better alternative to autologous bone for the clinical reconstruction of periodontal bone defects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",21563858,

Here, we report the use of a multiparametric, automated screening assay that incorporates sublethal and lethal cellular injury responses to perform high-throughput analysis of a batch of commercial metal/metal oxide nanoparticles (NP) with the inclusion of a quantum dot (QD1). The responses chosen for tracking cellular injury through automated epifluorescence microscopy included ROS production, intracellular calcium flux, mitochondrial depolarization, and plasma membrane permeability. The z-score transformed high volume data set was used to construct heat maps for in vitro hazard ranking as well as showing the similarity patterns of NPs and response parameters through the use of self-organizing maps (SOM). Among the materials analyzed, QD1 and nano-ZnO showed the most prominent lethality, while Pt, Ag, SiO2, Al2O3, and Au triggered sublethal effects but without cytotoxicity. In order to compare the in vitro with the in vivo response outcomes in zebrafish embryos, NPs were used to assess their impact on mortality rate, hatching rate, cardiac rate, and morphological defects. While QDs, ZnO, and Ag induced morphological abnormalities or interfered in embryo hatching, Pt and Ag exerted inhibitory effects on cardiac rate. Ag toxicity in zebrafish differed from the in vitro results, which is congruent with this material's designation as extremely dangerous in the environment. Interestingly, while toxicity in the initially selected QD formulation was due to a solvent (toluene), supplementary testing of additional QDs selections yielded in vitro hazard profiling that reflect the release of chalcogenides. In conclusion, the use of a high-throughput screening, in silico data handling and zebrafish testing may constitute a paradigm for rapid and integrated ENM toxicological screening.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",21323332,PMC3896549

TiO(2) NPs had no impact on growth or nutritional performance, and no major disturbances were observed in red or white blood cell counts, haematocrits, whole blood haemoglobin, or plasma Na(+). Ti accumulation occurred in the gill, gut, liver, brain and spleen during dietary TiO(2) exposure. Notably, some of these organs, especially the brain, did not clear Ti after exposure. The brain also showed disturbances to Cu and Zn levels (statistically significant at weeks 4 and 6; ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis, P < 0.05) and a 50% inhibition of Na(+)K(+)-ATPase activity during TiO(2) NP exposure. Na(+)K(+)-ATPase activity was unaffected in the gills and intestine. Total glutathione in the gills, intestine, liver and brain were not affected by dietary TiO(2) NPs, but thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) showed up to 50% decreases in the gill and intestine. We conclude that TiO(2) NPs behave like other toxic dietary metals where growth rate and haematology can be protected during sub-lethal exposures, but in the case of TiO(2) NPs this may be at the expense of critical organs such as the brain and the spleen.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",19590957,

METHODS: A total of 12 healthy New Zealand rabbits were injected complete Freund's adjuvant in foot pad to establish popliteal inflammatory lymph node model. Different doses (45, 90, 135 micromol Fe/kg) of USPIO were injected intravenously. Magnetic resonance scans were performed before and after USPIO injection to observe the enhancement features of different groups. T2 signal intensity, T1 signal intensity, T2 x value, and T2 value were measured and T2 enhancement ratio was calculated at different time points. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after USPIO injection, there was no statistical difference in T2 signal intensity and T2 enhancement ratio between 90 and 135 micromol Fe/kg dose groups, but both were superior to 45 micromol Fe/kg group (P < 0.05). There were no statistical differences in T2 signal intensity, T1 signal intensity, T2 value, and T2 enhance ratio among different postcontrast time delays from 6 to 24 hours in 90 micromol Fe/kg group (P > 0.05), and signal reduction of lymph nodes peaked 18 hours after USPIO injection. Better images were acquired with a postcontrast delay of 18-24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Lymph nodes can be enhanced well with a dose of 90 micromol Fe/kg. Postcontrast delay of 18-24 hours is appropriate for acquiring satisfactory enhancement images.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",19507597,

All the formulations were cleared rapidly from circulation; clearance of mannose-coated poly (propylene imine) dendrimer (M-PPI) and lactose-coated poly(propylene imine) dendrimer (L-PPI) was faster than PPI-5.0G. All the formulations accumulated in liver to a significant extent, but only those with terminal carbohydrate moieties were retained for a longer period. Significant accumulation of PPI-5.0G and M-PPI was observed in kidneys as against very less activity in the case of L-PPI. Rapid clearance of the dendrimers was in accordance with the earlier reports. Higher and prolonged retention of M-PPI and L-PPI in liver was attributed to lectin-carbohydrate interactions. Lesser accumulation of L-PPI in kidneys was suggestive of its lesser excretion. This observation can be explained on the basis of the molecular weight of L-PPI, which was greater than the threshold of glomerular excretion. In general, it was observed that the carbohydrate-coated dendrimers were distributed in liver to a significant extent. This information could serve as a useful platform in designing carbohydrate-coated dendrimers for selective delivery of bioactive agents to liver.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",17572354,

The precursory molecular or cellular events that initiate plaque growth and that ultimately contribute to plaque instability, however, cannot be detected directly with any current diagnostic modality. METHODS AND RESULTS: Atherosclerosis was induced in New Zealand White rabbits fed 1% cholesterol for approximately 80 days. alpha(v)beta3-Integrin-targeted, paramagnetic nanoparticles were injected intravenously and provided specific detection of the neovasculature within 2 hours by routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a clinically relevant field strength (1.5 T). Increased angiogenesis was detected as a 47+/-5% enhancement in MRI signal averaged throughout the abdominal aortic wall among rabbits that received alpha(v)beta3-targeted, paramagnetic nanoparticles. Pretreatment of atherosclerotic rabbits with alpha(v)beta3-targeted, nonparamagnetic nanoparticles competitively blocked specific contrast enhancement of the alpha(v)beta3-targeted paramagnetic agent. MRI revealed a pattern of increased alpha(v)beta3-integrin distribution within the atherosclerotic wall that was spatially heterogeneous along both transverse and longitudinal planes of the abdominal aorta. Histology and immunohistochemistry confirmed marked proliferation of angiogenic vessels within the aortic adventitia, coincident with prominent, neointimal proliferation among cholesterol-fed, atherosclerotic rabbits in comparison with sparse incidence of neovasculature in the control animals. CONCLUSIONS: This molecular imaging approach might provide a method for defining the burden and evolution of atherosclerosis in susceptible individuals as well as responsiveness of individual patients to antiatherosclerotic therapies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",14557370,

Catheter-based local delivery of pharmacologic agents offers a potential therapeutic approach to reducing restenosis and minimizing undesirable systemic side effects. However, the intramural retention of liquid agents is low. Therefore, to achieve a sustained and regional release of the therapeutic agent it must be encapsulated in nanoparticle carrier systems. The purpose of this study was to investigate the size dependence of the penetration of nanoparticles after local delivery into the vessel wall of the aorta abdominalis of New Zealand white rabbits. Two milliliters of a 0.025% fluorescence-labeled polystyrene nanoparticle suspension with diameters ranging from 110 to 514 nm were infused at 2 atm and at constant PTA pressure of 8 atm into the aorta abdominalis. After the infused segments were removed, the location of nanoparticles was visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The study demonstrates a size-dependent nanoparticle penetration into the intact vessel wall. While nanoparticles of about 100 and 200 nm were deposited in the inner regions of the vessel wall, 514-nm nanoparticles accumulated primarily at the luminal surface of the aorta. The observations confirm that size plays a critical role in the distribution of particles in the arterial vessel wall. It is additionally influenced by the formation of pressure-induced infusion channels, as well as by the existence of anatomic barriers, such as plaques, at the luminal surface of the aorta or the connective elastic tissue.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",12646012,PMC2751330

Model studies at the molecular level are urgently needed in order to help reveal the interplay between these particles and biological systems, and thereby to indicate the direction of further research. In the present study, simulated annealing molecular dynamics is adjusted and applied to generate an array of conformations for a sample peptide oligoalanine possibly binding to polyethylene and nylon 6,6 nanoplastics. The resulting structures, with a diameter of up to 5 nm, were investigated with the aid of static quantum chemical calculations. The obtained data unequivocally show that both plastic nanoparticles influence the relative stability of alpha-helix,beta-hairpin, and other conformations strongly. Polyethylene nanoparticle increases the stability of the helical foldamer. Nylon 6,6 nanoplastic offers strong plastic-peptide interactions on its surface, making the unfolding of the peptide thermodynamically highly favorable. These results further underscore that nanoplastics can do significant molecular-level damage to living organisms via facilitating the misfolding and denaturation of proteins. Furthermore, it is apparent that plastics can have very different effects on living matter depending upon their composition, and hence experiments with any single kind of plastics (eg, polystyrene) should not be considered generally valid for all nanoplastics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

This premise is particularly notable with nano-sized plastic particulates, a potentially most pernicious form of plastic pollution. In this study, even in a hypothetical scenario in terms of dose (1, 3, 6 and 10 mg/kg-day) and exposure time (five weeks), the potential endocrine disturbances with particular reference to reproductive toxicity of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS NPs, average size = 38.92 nm) was studied in male rats considering biomarkers of semen quality, changes in hormonal milieu and molecular signatures of endocrine disruption. Sperm DNA integrity and its chromatin structure were also analyzed. There observed significant inverse associations between exposure to PS NPs and serum concentrations of testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Tissue and cell impairments were also noticed even at the lowest tested dosage, though the severity of lesions followed a clear dose-response pattern. DNA damage as well as alterations in sperm morphology and viability were evident, again proportionally with the amount of exposure dosage. RT-qPCR data were in accordance with the results of physio-histological alterations and fluorescence imaging, as significant down-regulation of PLZF, DAZL, FSH and LH gene expressions were noticed in the testis of exposed animals, suggesting that exposure interferes with spermatogenesis and also with HPT-axis. However, among those with highest exposure dosage, expressions of FSH and LH were significantly increased. ABP modulation further revealed evidence of a nonlinear dose response. The association between PS NPs exposure and GnRH was indeed in an unexpected positive direction, though these end-points were less sensitive at higher doses. Although additional evidence is warranted, the present work provides new insights into the possible risks of plastic nanoparticles exposure in humans, especially since the problem is growing and will persist for a long time.

Plastic debris that is fragmented into microplastics or nanoplastics has unclear effects on organismal systems. Recently, this debris was shown to affect biota and to be gradually spreading through the food chain. In addition, studies have indicated that workers in plastic-related industries develop many kinds of cancer because of chronic exposure to high levels of airborne microplastics. Microplastics and nanoplastics are everywhere now, contaminating our water, air, and food chain. In this review, we introduce a classification of plastic polymers, define microplastics and nanoplastics, identify plastics that contaminate food, describe the damage and diseases caused by microplastics and nanoplastics, and the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this damage and disease as well as solutions for their amelioration. Thus, we expect to contribute to the understanding of the effects of microplastics and nanoplastics on cellular and molecular mechanisms and the ways that the uptake of microplastics and nanoplastics are potentially dangerous to our biota.

However, NPs are smaller in size, have a higher affinity for cells, and surface and volume ratios are higher than those of microplastics. NPs may also enter biological tissues, blood and cells, which may cause greater potential harm to organisms. In this paper, firstly, the environmental fate of NPs accumulation and deposition is summarized, and further research is needed in the future; secondly, the current techniques for NPs extraction and characterization of NPs extraction and characterization are summarized. At present, the analytical methods of NPs are in the primary stage, and lack of standardized and accurate methods; finally, the toxic effects of NPs on biological morphology, behavior and reproduction are discussed. It has been found that the small size and high surface area of NPs make them more toxic to organisms than microplastics.

G. M.",,,,,"There is a debate on whether the Trojan horse principle is occurring for nanoscale plastic debris (NPD 1 mu m). It is realized that NPD have a high capacity to sorb environmental contaminants such as metals from the surrounding environment compared to their microplastic counterparts, which influences the sorbed contaminants' uptake. Herein, we studied the influence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on the time-resolved sorption of ionic silver (Ag+) onto polymeric nanomaterials, as models of NPD, as a function of particle size (300 and 600 nm) and chemical composition [polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE)]. Subsequently, the toxicity of NPD and their co-occurring (adsorbed and absorbed) Ag+ on Daphnia magna was determined. Silver nitrate was mixed with 1.2 x 10(-5) NPD particles/mL for 6 days. The extent of Ag+ sorption onto NPD after 6 days was as follows: 600 nm PS-NPD 300 nm PS-NPD > 300 nm PE-NPD. The presence of DOM in the system increased the sorption of Ag+ onto 300 nm PS-NPD and PE-NPD, whereas DOM decreased the sorption onto 600 nm PS-NPD. Exposure to 1 mg/L NPD or 1 mu g/L Ag+ was not toxic to daphnids. However, the mixture of these concentrations of PS-NPD and Ag+ induced toxicity for both sizes (300 and 600 nm). The addition of DOM (1, 10 and 50 mg/L) to the system inhibited the combined toxicity of Ag+ and NPD regardless of the size and chemical composition. Taken together, in natural conditions where the concentration of DOM is high e.g. in freshwater ecosystems, the sorption of metals onto NPD depends on the size and chemical composition of the NPD. Nevertheless, under realistic field conditions where the concentration of DOM is high, the uptake of contaminants in D. magna that is influenced by the Trojan horse principles could be negligible.

The lack of universally accepted methods for quantifying microplastic contamination, including consistent application of microscopy, photography, an spectroscopy and photography, may result in unrealistic contamination estimates. Here, we present and apply an analysis workflow tailored to quantifying microplastic contamination in marine waters, incorporating stereomicroscopic visual sorting, microscopic photography and attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The workflow outlines step-by-step processing and associated decision making, thereby reducing bias in plastic identification and improving confidence in contamination estimates. Specific processing steps include (i) the use of a commercial algorithm-based comparison of particle spectra against an extensive commercially curated spectral library, followed by spectral interpretation to establish the chemical composition, (ii) a comparison against a customised contaminant spectral library to eliminate procedural contaminants, and (iii) final assignment of particles as either natural- or anthropogenic-derived materials, based on chemical type, a compare analysis of each particle against other particle spectra, and physical characteristics of particles. Applying this workflow to 54 tow samples collected in marine waters of North-Western Australia visually identified 248 potential anthropogenic particles. Subsequent ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, chemical assignment and visual re-inspection of photographs established 144 (58%) particles to be of anthropogenic origin. Of the original 248 particles, 97 (39%) were ultimately confirmed to be plastics, with 85 of these (34%) classified as microplastics, demonstrating that over 60% of particles may be misidentified as plastics if visual identification is not complemented by spectroscopy. Combined, this tailored analysis workflow outlines a consistent and sequential process to quantify contamination by microplastics and other anthropogenic microparticles in marine waters. Importantly, its application will contribute to more realistic estimates of microplastic contamination in marine waters, informing both ecological risk assessments and experimental concentrations in effect studies.

At present, little is known about this source of exposure for aquatic organisms in the benthic environment. Exposure conditions were set up to mimick the contribution of microplastics through different exposure routes. Potential biological effects resulting from these exposures were investigated in the model organism Hediste diversicolor, an annelid worm. Cellular effects including alterations of immunological responses, lysosomal compartment changes, mitochondrial activity, oxyradical production and onset of genotoxicity were assessed in coelomocytes while temporary and permanent effects of oxidative stress were also performed at tissue level. In this study polyvinylchloride (PVC) microparticles were shown to adsorb benzo(a)pyrene with a time and dose-dependent relationship. The elevated bioavailability of the model pollutant after ingestion induced a clear pattern of biological responses. Toxicity mainly targeted impairment of cellular functioning and genotoxicity in H. diversicolor coelomocytes, while permanent effects of oxidative stress were observed at tissue level. Coelomocytes responded fast and with a higher degree of sensitivity to the adverse stimuli. The results showed that microplastic particles in sediments may play a significant role as vectors for organic pollutants.

The aim of this study was therefore to use a quantitative approach for determining ingestion and egestion of micro- and nanoplastics in Daphnia magna and to analyze the influence of particle size, exposure duration and the presence of food. One week old animals were exposed to 2 gm and 100 nm fluorescent polystyrene beads (1 mg/I) for 24 h, followed by a 24 h egestion period in clean medium. During both phases body burdens of particles were determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity in dissolved tissues. Ingestion and egestion were investigated in the absence and presence of food (6.7.105 cells of Raphidocelis subcapitata per ml). Furthermore, feeding rates of daphnids in response to particle exposure were measured as well as effects on reproduction during a 21 days exposure (at 1 mg/1, 0.5 mg/I and 0.1 mg/I) to investigate potential impairments of physiology. Both particle sizes were readily ingested, but the ingested mass of particles was five times higher for the 2 gm particles than for the 100 nm particles. Complete egestion did not occur within 24 h but generally higher amounts of the 2 pm particles were egested. Animal body burdens of particles were strongly reduced in the presence of food. Daphnid feeding rates decreased by 21% in the presence of 100 nm particles, but no effect on reproduction was found despite high body burdens of particles at the end of 21 days exposure. The lower egestion and decreased feeding rates, caused by the 100 nm particles, could indicate that particles in the nanometer size range are potentially more hazardous to D. magna compared to larger particle sizes.

The absorbed polystyrene particles in unfed tadpoles was significantly higher than those in the fed tadpoles at 12 and 24 h after exposure. After transfer to clean water, the fed tadpoles showed a significant decrease in the amount of absorbed polystyrene particles, while the unfed tadpoles showed no significant change in the amount of absorbed polystyrene particles. Our results suggested that microspheres were likely to be ingested and egested relatively fast by tadpoles. Our results indicated that aquatic vertebrate organisms might ingest more microplastics if the abundance of microplastics continues to increase while the available food becomes less.

Here, we extracted MP-like particles larger than 149 mu m from 17 salt brands originating from 8 different countries followed by the identification of their polymer composition using micro-Raman spectroscopy. Microplastics were absent in one brand while others contained between 1 to 10 MPs/Kg of salt. Out of the 72 extracted particles, 41.6% were plastic polymers, 23.6% were pigments, 5.50% were amorphous carbon, and 29.1% remained unidentified. The particle size (mean +/- SD) was 515 +/- 171 mu m. The most common plastic polymers were polypropylene (40.0%) and polyethylene (33.3%). Fragments were the primary form of MPs (63.8%) followed by filaments (25.6%) and films (10.6%). According to our results, the low level of anthropogenic particles intake from the salts (maximum 37 particles per individual per annum) warrants negligible health impacts. However, to better understand the health risks associated with salt consumption, further development in extraction protocols are needed to isolate anthropogenic particles smaller than 149 mu m.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

This study investigates microplastics in intestinal samples from harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) found along the coastline of Schleswig-Holstein (Germany) between 2014 and 2018. Out of 30 individuals found along the North Sea (NS) and the Baltic Sea (BS) coast, 28 specimens contained microplastic. This study found a relationship between the nutritional status of cetaceans and the amount of found microplastics. Harbour porpoises with a good or moderate nutritional status contained a higher number of microplastics, when compared with specimens in a poor nutritional status. In addition, when individuals died accidently due to suspected bycatch in gillnets, where a feeding event is highly assumed or a pharyngeal entrapment happened, the microplastic burden was higher. In total, 401 microplastics (>= 100 mu m), including 202 fibres and 199 fragments were found. Intestines of the specimens of the BS contained more microplastics than the ones from the NS. Differences in the share of fibres could be revealed: for BS fibres constituted 51.44% and for NS, fibres constituted 47.97%. The polymers polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyamide, acrylic (with nitrile component) and an acrylic/alkyd paint chip (with styrene and kaolin components) were identified. This is the first study investigating the occurrence of microplastics in harbour porpoises from German waters and will, thus, provide valuable information on the actual burden of microplastics in cetaceans from the North and Baltic Seas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

To assess the current state of knowledge, with a focus on the UK, a literature review of existing freshwater microplastics studies was conducted. Sampling and analytical methodologies currently used to detect, characterise and quantify microplastics were assessed and microplastic types, sources, occurrence, transport and fate, and microplastic-biota interactions in the UK's freshwater environments were examined. Just 32% of published microplastics studies in the UK have focused on freshwater environments. These papers cover microplastic contamination of sediments, water and biota via a range of methods, rendering comparisons difficult. However, secondary microplastics are the most common type, and there are point (e.g. effluent) and diffuse (non-point, e.g. sludge) sources. Microplastic transport over a range of spatial scales and with different residence times will be influenced by particle characteristics, external forces (e.g. flow regimes), physical site characteristics (e.g. bottom topography), the degree of biofouling, and anthropogenic activity (e.g. dam release), however, there is a lack of data on this. It is predicted that impacts on biota will mirror that of the marine environment. There are many important gaps in current knowledge; field data on the transport of microplastics from diffuse sources are less available, especially in England. We provide recommendations for future research to further our understanding of microplastics in the environment and their impacts on freshwater biota in the UK.

The results showed that the microplastic abundances of the Humen (HUM, 16.33 +/- 0.88 items/L), Zhaoqing (ZQ, 15.33 +/- 0.67 items/L), and Hutiaomen (HTM, 14.67 +/- 1.33 items/L) sites were significantly higher than those of the other sampling sites, indicating that the microplastics in Xijiang River and its estuary exhibited an unbalanced spatial distribution. The most common microplastic color was transparent and the major shape of the microplastics was fragments. Microplastics with a size of 0.01-0.1 mm were dominant throughout the 16 sampling sites. Polyolefin elastomer (POE, 33.33%), polyethylene terephthalate (PET, 23.81%), and polyurethane acrylate (PUA, 14.29%) were the dominant microplastic polymers. The microplastic abundance co-varied with most of the selected socio-economic indicators, including the population density, urban land area, gross domestic product (GDP), freshwater aquatic products, and freshwater cultivated area, but without significant differences, indicating that there are additional factors affecting the microplastic abundance. The potential risk (i.e., the potential ecological risk, RI; polymer risk index, H; and pollution load index, PLI) posed by the microplastics was higher in HUM, followed by ZQ and HTM, and it was lower for the other sites, suggesting that the main outlets and the biggest city on the Xijiang River contributed more to the high risks of microplastic pollution. Consistent with microplastic abundance distribution profiles, the average potential risk index values of the western river outlets were higher than those of the eastern river outlets and the Xijiang River, implying that the western river outlets had non-negligible potential ecological risks. Our findings deepen the understanding of the risks posed by microplastics and further contribute to microplastic risk management of riverine ecosystems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

We investigated the uptake of plastic particles by benthic filter feeding quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis) and associated toxicity exhibited through impacts on mortality, filtration rate, reproduction and oxygen consumption. Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Imaging Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) technology was used to assess the microplastic inclusion. For this purpose, quagga mussels were exposed to four treatments ranging from 0.0 to 0.8 g/L of a high density fluorescent red polyethylene powder in the size range of 10 -45 mu m for 24-h, and the targeted endpoints were quantified. Identification of several micrograms of microplastics in the digestive tract suggests rapid clearance from the water column by filtering. At the higher concentrations, about 95% of the microplastics ingested remained in the mussels after 24-h. Microplastics were found in the gills which correlated with decreasing filtration rate at higher microplastic concentrations. Despite large-scale ingestion, plastic exposure did not affect survivorship, reproduction rates, or oxygen consumption in the period examined. MALDI-IMS identified unique mass spectra that correlated with microplastic inclusion. This research suggests that microplastics can impair feeding through decreased filtration rates of filter feeding organisms, potentially resulting in a reduction of overall fitness over time and that MALDI-IMS may have the potential to identify microplastics and changes in tissue at the borders of plastic inclusion.

One of the main environmental risks associated with microplastics is their bioavailability to marine organisms. Up to date, ingestion has been widely accepted as the sole way for the animals to uptake microplastics. Nevertheless, microplastics have also been found in some organs which are not involved in the process of ingestion. We hypothesize that the animal might uptake microplastics through adherence in addition to ingestion. To test this hypothesis, we collected mussels from the fishery farms, conducted exposure/clearance experiments and analyzed the accumulation of microplastics in specific organ of mussels. Our studies clearly showed the uptake of microplastic in multiple organs of mussels. In the field investigations, we found that the abundance of microplastic by weight but not by individual showed significant difference among organs, and the intestine contained the highest level of microplastics (9.2 items/g). In the uptake and clearance experiment, the accumulation and retention of microfibers could also be observed in all tested organs of mussels including foot and mantle. Our results strongly suggest that adherence rather than ingestion led to the accumulation of microplastics in those organs which are not involved in ingestion process. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to propose that adherence is a novel way for animals to uptake microplastics beyond ingestion. This new finding makes us rethink about the bioavailability, accumulation and toxicity of microplastics to aquatic animals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Consistent accurate identification of microplastic polymer composition is vital for understanding the effect of microplastic pollution in the environment. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy is becoming commonplace for identifying microplastics. Conventional spectral identification is based on library searching, a process that utilizes a search algorithm against digital databases containing single spectra of pristine reference plastics. Several conditions on environmental microplastic particles such as weathering, additives, and residues cause spectral alterations relative to pristine reference library spectra. Thus, library searching is vulnerable to misidentification of microplastic samples. While a classification process (classifier) based on a collection of spectra can alleviate misidentification problems, optimization of each classifier (tuning parameter) is required. Additionally, erratic results relative to the particular optimized tuning parameter can occur when microplastic samples originate from new environmental or biological conditions than those defining the class. Presented in this study is a process that utilizes spectroscopic measurements in a hybrid fusion algorithm that depending on the user preference, simultaneously combines high-level fusion with low- and mid-level fusion based on an ensemble of non-optimized classifiers to assign microplastic samples into specific plastic categories (classes). The approach is demonstrated with 17 classifiers using FT-IR for binary classification of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) microplastic samples from environmental sources. Other microplastic types are evaluated for non-class PET and HDPE membership. Results show that high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are obtained thereby reducing the risk of misidentifying microplastics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

To gain a clearer understanding of microplastic availability to marine life, and the risks they pose to the health of benthic communities, ecological processes and food security, it is important to obtain accurate measures of microplastic abundance in marine sediments. To date, methods for extracting microplastics from marine sediments have been disadvantaged by complexity, expense, low extraction efficiencies and incompatibility with very fine sediments.        Here we present a new, portable method to separate microplastics from sediments of differing types, using the principle of density floatation. The Sediment-Microplastic Isolation (SMI) unit is a custom-built apparatus which consistently extracted microplastics from sediments in a single step, with a mean efficiency of 95.8% (+/- SE 1.6%; min 70%, max 100%). Zinc chloride, at a density of 1.5 g cm(-3), was deemed an effective and relatively inexpensive floatation media, allowing fine sediment to settle whilst simultaneously enabling floatation of dense polymers. The method was validated by artificially spiking sediment with low and high density microplastics, and its environmental relevance was further tested by extracting plastics present in natural sediment samples from sites ranging in sediment type; fine silt/clay (mean size 10.25 +/- SD 3.02 mu m) to coarse sand (mean size 1493 +/- SD 49.9 mu m). The method presented here is cheap, reproducible and is easily portable, lending itself for use in the laboratory and in the field, eg. on board research vessels.

In this study, the uptake of nanopolystyrene particles by Caenorhabditis elegans (C elegans) and their toxic effects were evaluated. Nanopolystyrene particles with sizes of 50 and 200 nm were prepared, and the L4 stage of C. elegans was exposed to these particles for 24 h. Their uptake was monitored by confocal microscopy, and various phenotypic alterations of the exposed nematode such as locomotion, reproduction and oxidative stress were measured. In addition, a metabolomics study was performed to determine the significantly affected metabolites in the exposed C. elegans group. Exposure to nanopolystyrene particles caused the perturbation of metabolites related to energy metabolism, such as TCA cycle intermediates, glucose and lactic acid. Nanopolystyrene also resulted in toxic effect including induction of oxidative stress and reduction of locomotion and reproduction. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into the toxic effects of nanopolystyrene particles.

We evaluated the use of the 1% Rose Bengal stain in improving the identification of microplastics after a standard microplastic isolation process. The stain discriminated organic materials from potential microplastics with significant differences between numbers observed before (6.65 +/- 5.73) and after staining (2.91 +/- 3.43). Numbers of potential microplastics observed under the conventional method (without staining) in sediment, feacal matter of shorebirds and the lagoon water were respectively 3.55 g(-1), 0.8 g(-1) and 0.13 ml(-1) but reduced to 1.85 g(-1) of sediment, 0.35 g(-1) of feacal material and 0.09 ml(-1) of water after staining. Colour composition of potential microplastics under the conventional method was brown (31.0%), black (26.5%), white (20.2%), translucent (16.7%) and red (5.6%). After staining, brown (49,2%), black (30.5%) white (2.3%) and translucent (18.0%) were retained but distinction could not be made between stained organic items and red-coloured microplastics. It was clear that the stain has the potential in improving microplastic identification but requires further investigations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Microplastics (MPs, < 5 mm) have been the focus of a particularly extensive investigation because of their ubiquity, large surface area, interactions with organisms, and the challenges they present in terms of disposal and management. However, studies regarding their fates and life cycle in ecosystems are still limited. This study examined the effects of presence of food (the green microalga Dunaliella salina) on egestion rate of polyethylene MPs in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Ingestion and egestion rates were calculated after 6, 12, 18, and 24 h of depuration. The results suggest that MPs exposed to algal food persisted in the mussels. A single exposure of MPs without food induced relatively rapid excretion by the mussels compared to MPs exposure with food. This could be attributed to the ability of mussels to distinguish between nutritive foods and unusable suspended particles. Thus, environmental factors, such as food abundance, can affect the cycle or fate of MPs in marine environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Microplastics (sizes of 20 mu m - 5 mm) and mesoplastics (5 mm - 2 cm) were detected using methods of density extraction, 30% H2O2 digestion and micro-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The abundance of microplastics was 78.00 +/- 12.91 and 62.50 +/- 12.97 items kg(-1) in shallow and deep soils, respectively. While, mesoplastics were found with abundance of 6.75 +/- 1.51 and 3.25 +/- 1.04 items kg(-1) in shallow and deep soils. Among these micro(meso)plastics, 48.79% and 59.81% were in size of <1 mm in shallow and deep soils. The main morphotypes of microplastics included fiber, fragment and film, mostly in color of black or transparent. Moreover, we found that topsoil contained higher concentrations and larger sizes of micro(meso)plastics than deep soil. In addition, the vast majority of micro(meso)plastics were polypropylene (50.51%) and polyethylene (43.43%).

The microplastic size ranged from 10 to 5000 mu m and were black, gray, blue, and transparent. Fiber, as the dominant shape, contributed up to 99.2% of the identified microplastics. The most common polymers were rayon (48.9%) followed by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (29.6%). Microplastics in tap water and water sources differed in size and polymer types but showed specific correlations. The analysis of Laoshan Reservoir and Jihongtan Reservoir indicated that human activities and atmospheric deposition contributed to the microplastics in the water sources. The potential risk of the microplastics was assessed by the potential risk index of the polymers.

This work primarilyaims to provide a qualitative and quantitative analysis of microplastics in sediments as well as in the seaworms (Hediste diversicolor) from eight sites from the Tunisian coasts using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman microspectroscopy. The second aim is to evaluate the potential toxic effects of environmental microplastics using a set of biomarkers such as Catalase, Glutathione-S-Transferase, Malondialdehyde and Acetylcholinesterase. Our findings showed that microplastics (1 mm-1.2 mu m) were present in all sediments with its abundance ranging from 129 to 606 items kg(-1). Microplastic accumulation in seaworms (3 mu m-0.22 mu m) was 0.5-3.7 items g(-1). The predominant polymer was polyethylene. Results also revealed a significant variation among sites in the parameters associated with oxidative stress. Thus, size abundance of microplastics in seaworms was mainly correlated with oxidative stress biomarkers. Our data should be carefully considered in view of the microplastic presence with several types and sizes in Tunisian coastal sites, their potential toxic effects, and their transfer into food web.

Microplastics were ubiquitous in the smaller fractions of the box corer samples from every station from depths between 4869 and 5766 m. They were found on the abyssal plain and in the sediments of the trench slope on both sides. The amount of microplastics differed between the stations, with lowest concentration of 60 pieces per m(2) and highest concentrations of more than 2000 pieces per m(2). Around 75% of the microplastics (defined here as particles <1 mm) we isolated from the sediment samples were fibers. Other particles were paint chips or small cracked pieces of unknown origin. The Kuril-Kamchatka Trench area is known for its very rich marine fauna (Zenkevich, 1963).

Visual examination and acid digestion were the most common separation methods for seawater samples and organisms, while density flotation was the primary method for sediment. Few studies reported recovery rates, or investigated the physical or chemical impact on plastics. This knowledge gap may lead to misidentification of plastic or unreliable pollution estimates. Further investigation of the impact chemical treatments have on plastic is warranted. Factors, i.e. biomass loading, recovery rates, and chemical compatibility, must be considered to allow for appropriate methodology.

Nevertheless, the role of neurons in response to nanoplastic exposure and the underlying mechanism are still largely unclear. We here examined the role of neuronal JNK MAPK signaling in response to low-dose of polystyrene (100 nm) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Results Exposure to nanopolystyrene in the range of mu g/L could increase the expression of genes (jkk-1, mek-1, and jnk-1) encoding JNK MAPK signaling pathway. Meanwhile, RNAi knockdown of any of these genes induced a susceptibility to nanopolystyrene toxicity. In the neurons, SNB-1/synaptobrevin was identified as the downstream target of JNK-1/JNK, suggesting the alteration in neurotransmitter signals in nanopolystyrene-exposed nematodes. In nanopolystyrene-exposed nematodes, JNK-1 modulated TBH-1-mediated octopamine signal and CAT-2-mediated dopamine signal. TBH-1 and CAT-2 further regulated the response to nanopolystyrene by affecting the function of corresponding intestinal octopamine receptors (SER-6 and OCTR-1) and intestinal dopamine receptor (DOP-1). In the intestine, DOP-1 regulated the response to nanopolystyrene by activating the downstream signaling cascade in p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Conclusions Exposure to low-dose of nanopolystyrene could induce the response of neuronal JNK MAPK signaling pathway in nematodes. Our data further highlight the crucial role of neuronal JNK MAPK signaling-activated alteration in octopamine and dopamine signals in regulating the response to nanopolystyrene in organisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",,

The majority of microplastics in aquatic environments are shown to have rough surfaces due to various weathering processes (secondary microplastics; SMP), while laboratory studies predominantly utilise pristine microplastics (primary microplastics: PMP). Here we present the results from a study comparing the chronic effects of pristine PMP and artificially weathered SMP to three different Cladoceran species (Daphnia magna, Daphnia pulex, Ceriodaphnia dubia). We assessed the impact of PMP and SMP on reproductive output using various measured parameters, including time of first brood, size of first brood, size of first three broods, cumulative number of neonates, total number of broods and terminal length of test animals. Our results show that reproductive output of all species declined in a dose-dependent manner. The No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) was less than the lowest tested concentration (10(2) p/mL) for at least one measured endpoint for all species and both PMP and SMP. Further, it was inferred that species sensitivity varied inversely with body size for most endpoints, resulting in C dubia being the most sensitive species; and D. magna being the least sensitive species under study. In addition, PMP appeared to have greater toxic potential as compared to SMP. This study is the first to directly compare the chronic toxicity of both pristine and weathered microplastic particles on three freshwater toxicological model organisms. Our results indicate that sensitivity in reproduction and growth to microplastics may differ between species and type of microplastic exposed; highlighting the importance of using multiple species and structural types of particles.

The transmittance from transparency to opaqueness was irreversible in the inked regions even after the complete water evaporation. It was believed that PS nanoparticles immigrated from the bulk of gelatin network to its surfaces due to the Brownian motion. When the gelatin was swollen by water, the nanoparticles stuck to the surfaces after water evaporation. Secondly, to testify the principle, we further coated additional gelatin-alginate hydrogel layer on the top to prevent the immigration of nanoparticles to outer surfaces. It was found that ink marks can be erased after water evaporation, and such write-and-erase process can be repeated multiple times with excellent performances.

Such MPs have been found in several wild species and other natural resources, including some consumed as food by humans, with possible adverse effects on ecosystem and human health. The central aim of this work was to review the published literature regarding the contamination of sea commercial salts (sea and terrestrial origins) and its possible impacts on human health. Moreover, to lead to a comprehensive understanding of the paradigm, a short introduction and revision of the environmental contamination by MPs and its effects are included. MPs have been found in commercial salts from 128 brands, from 38 different countries spanning over five continents. The concentration of MPs found in the samples analysed is lower than the concentrations of MPs reported in other resources, such as blue mussels. However, as commercial salts are used every day and by all humans, they constitute a long-term exposure route for the general population in addition to others (e.g., animals consumed as food by humans, water, air). Therefore, commercial salts contaminated with MPs may contribute to the potential long-term adverse effects resulting from human exposure to these particles.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The microplastic waste from Prapratno beach sediment consisted of 116 specimens, which could be classified into 6 micro litter categories according to EU TG ML Master List (Fig. 1). Fragments were found to be the predominant category of microplastic waste from the sediment of Prapratno beach, followed by granules, films, pellets and foams, which were present in approximately the same number, while filaments were the least represented category (Fig. 2). The most important categories by mass were granules and fragments, followed by pellets, while films, foams and filaments made up a very small content of the total sample mass (Fig. 3). The numerical contents (Fig. 4), did not correspond to the mass contents (Fig. 3) of individual categories due to the different densities and thicknesses of the specimens in each category. Almost all the base colours were present in the analysed samples (Fig. 5), while 90.52 % of specimens were opaque (Fig. 6). The maximum dimension and surface area of each specimen was determined by Digimizer Image Analysis Software. Maximum dimensions in the range of 1-5 mm were observed in 52.59 % of the specimens, thus belonging to large microplastics (LMP), while 47.41 % of the specimens had maximum dimensions in the range of 5-20 mm, thus belonging to so-called mezzo litter. The distribution of specimen dimensions within LMP is shown in Fig. 8, and within mezzo litter in Fig. 9. The fraction of each category in the total sample surface area is shown in Fig. 10. These results are similar to the numerical fractions of categories, since the samples were generally in the narrow range of maximum dimensions, and thus their numerical fractions corresponded to their fraction in the total surface of the sample. Identification of plastic material was performed by infrared spectroscopy, HATR technique. The obtained spectra were compared with the spectra in the database (Fig. 11-13). The results showed (Fig. 14) that the microplastic waste from Prapratno beach was made of polyethylene (82.46 %), polystyrene (11.40 %) and polypropylene (6.14 %). These polymers came from plastic packaging since polyethylene, polystyrene and polypropylene are the most used polymers for plastic packaging.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The papers reporting numbers found in water bodies cannot be compared because there are no standard methods for collection and analysis. It is clear that using nets for sampling misses most of the microfibers, which are the most abundant form when whole water samples are analyzed, and that microscopic identification has a very high error rate compared to chemical analytical equipment which can also identify the polymers. It is clear that most animals studied eat mps; we should learn what attracts the animals to the mps and what proportion pass right through and are defecated vs those that move into the tissues. It is considered that mps are a vector for transfer of toxic chemicals into the food chain. Let us investigate to what degree what proportion of contaminants are removed in the digestive system vs. staying bound tightly to the mps. Experimental studies should also use environmentally relevant doses and the shapes and sizes of mps that are most abundant in the environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Many species of birds, reptiles, and fishes are directly impaired by plastics as they can get entangled in ropes and drown or they can ingest plastic fragments which, in turn, may clog their stomachs and guts. Microplastics of less than 1 mm can be ingested by small invertebrates, but their fate in the digestive organs and their effects on the animals are yet not well understood. We embedded fluorescent microplastics in artificial agarose-based food and offered the food to marine isopods, Idotea emarginata. The isopods did not distinguish between food with and food without microplastics. Upon ingestion, the microplastics were present in the stomach and in the gut but not in the tubules of the midgut gland which is the principal organ of enzyme secretion and nutrient resorption. The feces contained the same concentration of microplastics as the food which indicates that no accumulation of microplastics happens during the gut passage. Long-term bioassays of 6 weeks showed no distinct effects of continuous microplastic consumption on mortality, growth, and intermolt duration. I. emarginata are able to prevent intrusion of particles even smaller than mu m into the midgut gland which is facilitated by the complex structure of the stomach including a fine filter system. It separates the midgut gland tubules from the stomach and allows only the passage of fluids and chyme. Our results indicate that microplastics, as administered in the experiments, do not clog the digestive organs of isopods and do not have adverse effects on their life history parameters.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

In the environment plastics can degrade into increasingly smaller particles, reaching a nanometer size which increases their potential to be incorporated by organisms. Currently it is recognized that the plastics in the environment are reaching humans via contaminated food, drinks, and air but their effects on humans are largely unknown.

Here, we quantify the presence of microplastic particles (MPs) in river organisms upstream and downstream of five UK Wastewater Treatment Works (WwTWs). MPs were identified in approximately 50% of macroinvertebrate samples collected (Baetidae, Heptageniidae and Hydropsychidae) at concentrations up to 0.14 MP mg tissue(-1) and they occurred at all sites. MP abundance was associated with macroinvertebrate biomass and taxonomic family, but MPs occurred independently of feeding guild and biological traits such as habitat affinity and ecological niche. There was no increase in plastic ingestion downstream of WwTW discharges averaged across sites, but MP abundance in macroinvertebrates marginally increased where effluent discharges contributed more to total runoff and declined with increasing river discharge. The ubiquity of microplastics within macroinvertebrates in this case study reveals a potential risk from MPs entering riverine food webs through at least two pathways, involving detritivory and filter-feeding, and we recommend closer attention to freshwater ecosystems in future research.

MPs have the chance to adsorb different kind of organisms and compounds on their outer surface, including bacteria, viruses, algae, and abiotic substances. In this way, they can cause sever hazard once they enter the food chain. Their harm to higher organisms is discussed as well as main routes of MPs-organism interactions, i.e., ventilation, and ingestion.

Microplastic pollution has become aworld issue. As themajor section of fiber production and processing, textile industry is an important potential source ofmicrofibers, while receiving limited attention. To better understand the source and fate of textile microfibers, in this study, a typical textile industrial park in China is selected as the studying site. Microfibers in textile wastewater from typical textile mills and centralizedwastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) of the park, and microfibers in nearby surface water were identified and characterized. The main results showed that the microfiber concentration in textile printing and dyeing wastewater could reach as high as 54,100 MFs/L. Although the removal efficiencies of microfibers by existing wastewater treatment processes can be over 85%, the average microfiber concentration in the effluents from the centralized WWTPs of the industrial park still reached 537.5MFs/L, releasing 430 billionmicrofiber items per day. Microfiber release from textile wastewater is considerably higher than that from municipal sewage treatment plants, making it a significant contributor to microfibers in natural water bodies. Small-sized and colored microfibers increased in proportion in the treated effluents. Given the complex textile wastewater constituents, the potential negative environmental impacts of textilemicrofibers may be intensified by the enhanced adsorption and transfer of textile pollutants through these microfibers.

In order to partially fill this gap, we used a mass spectrometry based functional proteomics to evaluate the modulation of protein profiling in zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), one of the most useful freshwater biological model. Mussels were exposed for 6 days in static conditions to two different microplastic mixtures, composed by two types of virgin polystyrene microbeads (size = 1 and 10 mu m) each one.

Proteomics' analyses of gills showed the complete lack of proteins' modulation after the exposure to the low-concentrated mixture, while even 78 proteins were differentially modulated after the exposure to the high-concentrated one, suggesting the presence of an effect-threshold.

Bivalves were exposed for 96 h to florfenicol (1.8 and 7.1 mg/l), microplastics (0.2 and 0.7 mg/l), ormixtures of the two substances. After 96 h, all bivalves exposed to antimicrobial treatments had florfenicol in their body (e.g. 2 +/- 1 mu g/g). Microplastics were found in the gut, lumen of the digestive gland, connective tissue, hemolymphatic sinuses, and gills surface of animals. Florfenicol caused a significant inhibition of cholinesterase (ChE) activity (similar to 32%). Animals exposed to 0.2 mg/l ofmicroplastics showed ChE activity inhibition (31%), and no other significant alterations. Mixtures caused feeding inhibition (57-83%), significant ChE inhibition (44-57%) and of isocitrate dehydrogenase activity, and increased anti-oxidant enzymes activity and lipid peroxidation levels. Overall, the results indicate that C. fluminea take up florfenicol and microplastics fromthe water and accumulated or at least retained it in their body for some time; both florfenicol (low ppm range) and microplastics (ppb range) were toxic to C. fluminea, with mixtures containing florfenicol and microplastics being more toxic. Thus, the risk of exposure and toxic effects of florfenicol to C. fluminea and other bivalves, and its predators increase in ecosystems contaminated with the antimicrobial and microplastics, as well as to humans consuming contaminated species from these ecosystems.

Fragments were the most common morphology (66%) followed by fibers. Half of these particles were confirmed to be polymeric in nature using FTIR spectroscopy with polypropylene being the most common polymer type (54%), which matches a common plastic used for the manufacture of bottle caps. A small fraction of particles (4%) showed the presence of industrial lubricants. While spectroscopic analysis of particles smaller than 100 um was not possible, the adsorption of the Nile Red dye indicates that these particles are most probably plastic. Including these smaller particles (6.5-100 um), an average of 325 microplastic particles per liter of bottled water was found. Microplastic contamination range of 0 to over 10,000 microplastic particles per liter with 95% of particles being between 6.5 and 100 um in size.

Results showed that surface damage of earthworms was observed at the concentration of 1.5 g/kg LDPE after exposure 28 days. The microplastics were ingested in a dose-response manner. Smaller sizes of LDPE microplastics were found in the casts of E. fetida, and approximately 30% of the microplastics egested (size < 100 mu m) were increased compared with initial microplastics in the soil. The catalase activity and malondialdehyde content increased significantly at the concentration of 1.0 g/kg LDPE after exposure 28 days, and acetylcholine esterase was significantly stimulated at concentrations of 1.5 and 1.0 g/kg LDPE on days 21 and 28, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate the potential risk of LDPE microplastics to E. fetida and may provide a reference for the impact of microplastics on terrestrial creatures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

To address this issue, we tried to determine the efficiency of two common methods (washing and ashing experimental glassware) for removing airborne MPs and identified airborne contamination during MP analytical procedure. The results showed the removal efficiencies of washing and ashing were an average of 88%-98% and 100%, respectively, indicating that both methods could eliminate most of the spiked airborne MPs with no significant difference noted between the two methods. Although rigorous measures were taken to prevent contamination from ambient air, trace amounts of airborne MPs were still detected, which is an issue that has not been adequately investigated in previous studies. All of the procedural contaminants detected in this study were fibrous. Approximately 88% of these fibers were cotton-like (cotton, cellulose, and cellophane) fibers, and 13% of them were plastic. Surprisingly, cotton-like fibers and MPs had a similar size distribution, suggesting that they may have undergone a similar weathering process. In the end, to cope with inevitable airborne contamination, several measures were proposed for further research. Such measures will provide the necessary methodological assistance for accurate quantification of MP pollution in the field. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, the identification process itself in the meaning of a traceable and transparent documentation is hard to find in many research studies. Unfortunately, this can make it difficult to estimate if the presented results are representative and reproducible, as the evaluation process during microplastics identification depends dramatically on the performed data treatment.

Despite more than a decade of widespread study, there is currently no established time series of microplastic measurements and the research community is yet to establish a standardised set of methods that will allow data to be collected in a quick, affordable and interoperable way. We present a sampling technique involving the connection of a custom-built microplastic sampling device to the pump-underway ship intake system of a research vessel (RV) as an unexploited opportunity for oceanic monitoring needs concerning microplastic abundance and distribution. The method is cost effective, highly versatile and accurate, and is able to sample particles down to 50 mu m from opportunity platforms, thus contributing to an emerging area of study, and in particular helping to increase the monitoring reporting of data, and thereby serving as a valuable aid for the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Sampling was performed during three consecutive oceanographic cruises in the subtropical NE Atlantic over a year, sampling subsurface waters (4 m depth) during navigation and while on coastal and oceanic stations. Microplastic particles were found in all stations and transects sampled.

The assay employs fluorescamine, a primary-amine specific fluorogenic dye, to label proteins. Because fluorescamine could specifically target the surface amines on proteins, a conformational change of the protein upon interaction with nanoparticles will result in a change in fluorescence. In the present study, the assay was applied to test the interactions between a selection of proteins and nanoparticles made of polystyrene, silica, or iron oxide. The particles were also different in their hydrodynamic diameter, synthesis procedure, or surface modification. Significant labeling differences were detected when the same protein incubated with different particles. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the collected fluorescence profiles revealed clear grouping effects of the particles based on their properties. The results prove that fluorescamine labeling is capable of detecting proteinnanoparticle interactions, and the resulting fluorescence profile is sensitive to differences in nanoparticles physical properties. The assay can be carried out in a high-throughput manner, and is rapid with low operation cost. Thus, it is well suited for evaluating interactions between a larger number of proteins and nanoparticles. Such assessment can help to improve our understanding on the molecular basis that governs the biological behaviors of nanomaterials.

However, the interactions between microplastics (MPs) and crude oil, and the transfer kinetics of sorbed oil from ingested MPs into aquatic biota are largely unknown. In this study, interactions between MPs and crude oil in seawater and digestive tract mimic of aquatic biota have been examined. To mimic the living, transportation and cooking conditions of aquatic organisms, sorption and desorption behaviors were investigated under room temperature-bath (25 degrees C), ice-bath (0 similar to 4 degrees C) and boiling water-bath (95 similar to 100 degrees C), and pH was set as 4 and 7 for the simulated gut fluid. The results showed that sorption capacity of polyethylene (PE) MPs for crude oil in seawater was higher than that in intestinal tract, indicating more oil residue in aqueous phase of gut fluid in the present of organic particles. The sorption kinetics models were well fitted to the pseudo-order model, and isotherms models were well fitted to the Freundlich model. In addition, the results demonstrated that temperature played a significant effect on crude oil viscosity, and the sorption capacity under different temperatures was in the order of 25 degrees C > 95 similar to 100 degrees C > 0 similar to 4 degrees C, indicating that more oil was remained in aqueous phase at boiling water-bath and ice-bath. The increment of pH enhances the sorption capacities of PE MPs. Moreover, the desorption experiment has supplemented the current findings from the sorption experiments. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The tested PE-MPs concentrations (1.25; 5; 20 g kg(-1)) were within the range of concentrations reported in riverbanks from highly urbanised areas (1 - 9 g kg(-1)), except for 20 g kg(-1) representing the worst-case scenario. After exposure to SC I, larvae presented high amounts (up to similar to 2400 particles/organism) of PE-MPs in their guts, with an average size-range of 30-60 mu m. In the SC II and III, larvae presented PE-MPs of higher diameter (up to 125 mu m) and a visible gut obstruction. The high number of particles in the larval gut (SC I) and/or difficulties for their egestion (SC I, II and III) induced oxidative damage and reduced aerobic energy production. In addition, larvae exposed to SC II and III revealed depletion in their total lipid reserves as a consequence of lacking nutrients, and the ones exposed to SC III presented a decrease in their detoxification capacity.        These results highlight that freshwater detritivores with low selective feeding behaviour (e.g., chironomids) are more prone to ingest microplastics, with potentially adverse effects on cellular metabolism, redox status and antioxidant-detoxification defences.

A proposed peculiar mechanism of formation allowed maintaining uniform their shell composition. The conjugation of molecules to the NPs was a real challenge since they are nano-hydrogels with high colloidal stability that can only be dialyzed for eventual removal of reagents. Therefore we have designed and proved a novel solid phase peptide synthesis method for Merrifield synthesis on nanoparticles based on the embedment of the NPs in a permeable and removable magnetic matrix.

A significant difference was observed in the quality of prawns stored in potato CNP-PVA film compared with prawns packed and stored in polyethylene film. The newly designed active packaging with CNP and fennel seed oil enhanced the shelf life of prawns up to two months for both HOSO (head on shell on) prawn and PD (peeled and deveined) prawn. Hence, the study recommends the potato peel CNP-PVA film with fennel seed oil as better choice to extend the shelf life of the prawns during storage compared with polyethylene packaging.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Here we used fluorescent and pristine polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) particles with two diameters (5 mu m and 20 mu m) to investigate the tissue distribution, accumulation, and tissue-specific health risk of MPs in mice. Results indicated that MPs accumulated in liver, kidney and gut, with a tissue-accumulation kinetics and distribution pattern that was strongly depended on the MPs particle size. In addition, analyses of multiple biochemical biomarkers and metabolomic profiles suggested that MPs exposure induced disturbance of energy and lipid metabolism as well as oxidative stress. Interestingly, blood biomarkers of neurotoxicity were also altered. Our results uncovered the distribution and accumulation of MPs across mice tissues and revealed significant alteration in several biomarkers that indicate potential toxicity from MPs exposure. Collectively, our data provided new evidence for the adverse consequences of MPs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

A 21-day bioassay was carried out. The effect criteria were parental mortality, somatic growth and several reproductive parameters. AuNP induced parental mortality, reduced the total offspring and caused immobile juveniles and aborted eggs. MP induced parental mortality, delayed the first brood release, decreased the number of broods released, the total offspring, and caused immobile juveniles. All the mixtures caused higher toxicity than AuNP and MP alone. Based on parental mortality, evidences of antagonism between AuNP and MP were observed at low concentrations of both mixture components, whereas evidences of synergism at high concentrations were found.

In JoVE Developmental Biology, the transparent, rapidly developing zebrafish embryo is ideal for visualizing developmental processes. When cells of interest are labeled with fluorescent photoconvertible proteins, they allow precise tracking of defined structures-highlighting specific cells while leaving other transgenic cells in the dark. Beretta et al. have established the photoswitchable monomeric orange (PSmOrange) system for zebrafish. This protein's orange-to-red spectrum allows it to visible in existing transgenic lines expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Microinjection of nuclear-targeted PSmOrange mRNA labels all cell nuclei with orange/red fluorescence, and targeted photoconversion switches its emission spectrum to far red. The quantum efficiency and stability of PSmOrange makes it a superb cell-tracking tool for living zebrafish during embryonic development and disease.        In JoVE Chemistry, few materials have found as many uses in so many diverse fields as gold nanoparticles. Their applications range from biological sensors to radio frequency-based cancer treatments. Gold nanoparticles are valued for their unique structural, optical and electronic properties. These special attributes caught the interest of Oliver Smithies, who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2007. This month, he and his colleagues describe a simple method for producing highly stable oligomeric clusters of gold nanoparticles, and present models that can predict particle size with great accuracy.        In JoVE Engineering, we look at the principles of positron emission tomography (PET), a non-invasive technique for imaging the body's inner tissues and organs. Montano-Zetina and Villalobos-Mora present a guide for constructing a simple, homemade PET system for fully characterizing its basic working principles. This prototype demonstrates the primary functions of PET, and serves as an elegant model for teaching its principles to the academic public.        In JoVE Medicine, it is well established that the bone marrow microenvironment provides a haven for hematopoietic diseases. This month, Slone et al. use cell types from the bone marrow niche in an in vitro co-culture model. This supports the generation of a subpopulation of chemoresistant tumor cells. These calls can be used to investigate the underlying pathways of tumor development and to test novel therapeutic strategies.        You've just had a sneak peek of the February 2016 issue of JoVE.

When aquatic animals are consumed as seafood, human exposure to those plastic particles is possible. However, only a few studies, applying largely different analytical procedures, assessed microplastics content in the edible part of seafood. In this study, ten protocols for the extraction of microplastics from biota were chosen and tested for their suitability to digest the edible part of a broad range of seafood species. The following criteria were used for this assessment: 1) feasibility to filtrate the entire digested sample with one filter of approximately 1 ?m pore size, 2) effect of reagents applied during the sample preparation on the polymer integrity as assessed by means of infrared and Raman spectroscopy as well as pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry, 3) total sample preparation time and the possibility to avoid the use of expensive reagents. The most suitable protocol was found to be an enzymatic-alkaline approach, consisting of a quick hydrolysis of proteins with pepsin for 2 h and a consecutive alkaline hydrolysis for 4 h, both at 37 ?C for most of the tested seafood species. Digestion efficiency of the optimised protocol was tested with fish fillets and soft tissues of commercially relevant molluscs and crustacean species. Compared to most other protocols described in literature, an adequate digestion of the seafood matrix was achieved faster without being significantly more cost- or labour-intensive. Moreover, only negligible degradation of eleven commercially relevant polymers excluding polyacrylonitrile was observed. Polymer integrity was assessed by a change in particle weight or surface as well as spectroscopic and chromatographic data. The optimised sample preparation protocol aims to support future method standardisation efforts in order to assess the dietary uptake of microplastics in humans.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Therefore, they are intensively cultivated to meet the rising demand. Mariculture is a potential source of microplastics (MPs). However, as a potential source of microplastics, little is known regarding the MPs pollution in macroalgae of open sea macriculture. Here we investigated the MPs characteristics in macroalgae in three sections of Haizhou Bay, an important mariculture area in China, during Pyropia culture (Pyropia yezoensis) and non-culture periods (Ulva pro, rfera, Sargossum horneri, Cladophora sp., Undaria pinnatifida, Ulva pertusa). It was found that P. yezoensis during the culture period had higher MPs abundance (0.17 +/- 0.08 particles g(-1) fresh weight) than other macroalgae (0.12 +/- 0.09 partides g(-1) fresh weight) during the non-culture period, particularly for the nearshore sections. There were more fiber MPs in P. yezoensis (90.43%) in culture period compared to macroalgae (84.46%) in nonculture period. Highly similar spectrum of plastics in culture gears and macroalgae was verified. Pyropia culture gears released about 1, 037 tons plastics into the environment annually and the MPs abundances in seawater during the culture and non-culture periods were 1.04 +/- 032 and 1.86 +/- 0.49 particles L-1, respectively. The gap of MPs abundance between the two periods can be attributed to the tremendous trapping by massive biomass of P. yezoensis during the culture period and the continuous plastic release during the non-culture period. study indicates that culture gears of macroalgae could be an important MPs source and the MPs can be transferred to human by edible macroalgae, and meanwhile macroalgae may be ideal biomonitors for MN pollution in seawater due to their unbiased trapping and immovability.

The abundance of MPs in drifting U. prolifera was 595-3917 times higher than that in seawater and increased along the drifting path from south to north in the Yellow Sea. In addition, four mechanisms of trapping plastics (twining, attachment, embedment, and wrapping) on or in U. prolifera were unmasked, which explains why the plant has such strong capacity to trap MPs. Laboratory incubation experiments showed that MPs (0.025-25 mg L-1) did not affect relative growth rate, effective photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII), or saturating irradiance of U. prolifera until reaching an extremely high concentration (100 mg L-1), indicating a high tolerance to MPs.

The key TBTK-parameters for mice liver, kidney, and gut posed by 5 or 20 mu m PS-MPs could be obtained.

Little is known about the effects of microplastics on human health. But what is clear is that they have landed on our tables, in the form of table salt or fish that we consume. Furthermore, graphic images have emerged of whales that have died from ingesting plastics as well as entanglement and suffocation of other aquatic animals. Plastic use has significantly increased over the years, mainly because it's a cheap form of material, it can easily be moulded and unlike paper, plastic keeps foods fresh for longer periods. Of late, there has been a growing trend of making less durable plastic materials which makes it difficult to reuse. These plastics are referred to as single use plastics and are said to account for 40% of all plastics manufactured. Statistics also show that from the total plastics produced globally, a meagre 9% has been recycled.

However, little is known about the microplastics (MPs) accumulation in sea urchins. Here, we investigated the abundances and characteristics of MPs in specific tissues of wild sea urchins for 12 sites across 2, 900 km of coastlines in northern China. Sea urchins from all sites were detected to have MPs, with a total detection rate of 89.52%. The MPs abundance in sea urchins from all sites ranged from 2.20 +/- 1.50 to 10.04 +/- 8.46 items/individual or 0.16 +/- 0.09 to 2.25 +/- 1.68 items/g wet weight. The samples from Dalian were found to have the highest value by individual, and samples from Lianyungang had the highest value by gram. Furthermore, MPs were found in different tissues of sea urchins, i.e., gut, coelomic fluid and gonads. The highest abundance of MPs was found in the gut of sea urchins, followed by coelomic fluid and gonads. The size of MPs ranged from 27 to 4742 mu m, and the mean size found in gut was bigger than coelomic fluid and gonads. More interestingly, the MPs abundance increased with the decrease of anus size, shell diameter and gonad index (the wet weight ratio of gonad to total soft tissues). The MPs were dominated by fiber in shape, blue-green in colour and cellophane in composition. The high MPs abundance in sea urchins indicates the potential risks to human as they are consumed in many parts of the world, particularly in Asia and Europe.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",,

Using this method, high-resolution encrypted images that became visible only in high humidity were obtained. Inks based on PSS with carboxylic groups on the surface were made, and their rheological parameters (viscosity, surface tension, and zeta-potential) were optimized according to the Ohnesorge theory. The obtained value of the zeta-potential indicated the stability of the synthesized colloidal inks. The dependences of the printing parameters on the concentration of ethylene glycol in PSS dispersion, the drop spacing, the shape of the printed pattern, waveform, the temperature of the printing process, and the degree of ordering of the PSS-based photonic crystal were investigated. The scanning electronic microscope (SEM) images confirmed that the optimal self-organization of PSS was achieved at the following values of 0.4% weight fraction (wt%) carboxylic groups, the drop spacing of 50 mu m, and the temperature of the printing table of 25 degrees C. High-resolution microstructures were obtained by drop-on-demand printing with a deposited drophead diameter of 21 mu m and an accuracy of +/- 2 mu m on silicon and glass substrates. The deposition of chitosan-based hydrogels on the obtained polystyrene photonic crystals allowed reversibly changing the order of the diffraction lattice of the photonic crystal during the swelling of the hydrogel matrix, which led to a quick optical response in the daylight. The kinetics of the appearance of the optical response of the obtained coating were discussed. The simplicity of production, the speed of image appearance, and the ability to create high-resolution patterns determine the potential applications of the proposed systems as humidity sensors or anticounterfeiting coatings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Herein, we fabricated a sandwichlike fire alarm fabric (Ag@Fe3O4-MS) based on Fe3O4 nanowire (NW) arrays and fish-scale-like silver sheets, designed by in situ layer-by-layer assembly on the surface of polypropylene (PP) nonwoven fabric. The Ag@Fe3O4-MS sensor has fish-scale-like silver sheets as self-assembling electrode layers on the upper and lower sides of fabric, which can be tailored into various shapes and integrated into other flexible electronics. The sensor provides a real-time monitoring strategy for early warning fire detection (below 100 degrees C). At room temperature, the fabricated Ag@Fe3O4-MS sensor is electrically insulating, while it switches to an electrical conductor when exposed to flame. In view of its fast response time (2 s) and sustained working time (at least 15 min), the sensor with a connected alarm light can immediately alert people of house fires. More importantly, this sensor can provide additional real-time information on the fire location and reliable real-time monitoring of fire rekindling. The sensor was exposed to fire for successive cycles with an average response of I = 43 mA, confirming the reliable repeatability to detect fires. This ultralight, flexible Ag@Fe3O4-MS sensor could have broad applications in home safety. Moreover, the sandwichlike design provides a reliable strategy to modify household fabric items to provide a fire warning function.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

However, previous toxicological studies examining MPs on freshwater and terrestrial organisms provide contradictory results, possibly due to few investigations at environmentally relevant concentrations. Here, the nematode Caenorhabdiiis elegans (C. thwarts), a model organisms with both aquatic and terrestrial free-living forms, was employed to investigate the effects of 1 and 5 mu m MPs (10(7)-10-(10) particles/m(2)) on the intake, lifespan, defecation rhythm, defecation-related neurons and transcriptional expression of related genes (skn-1, mkk-4, pmk-1, cpr-1 and itr-1). We demonstrated that the percentage of MP-contaminated nematodes increased with increasing exposure concentrations and duration. The lifespan of nematodes in the lower concentration exposure groups (2.4 x 10(7) and 2.4 x 10(8) particles/m(2)) decreased more prominently than that of higher concentration groups (2.4 x 10(9) and 2.4 x 10(10) particles/m(2)) after a 72-h exposure period. Concomitantly, expression of the skn-1 gene, involved in detoxification and lifespan regulation, was significantly altered at lower MP concentrations. Physiologically, the defecation rhythm after a 72-h exposure period was most strongly affected by 1 mu m MPs at 2.4 x 10(8) partides/m(2). The significant up-regulation of related genes by 1 mu m MPs appears responsible for the shortened defecation interval. Results of this study identified a potential toxicity threat to C. elegans from exposure to MPs at environmentally relevant concentrations and provide novel evidence for MP risks to freshwater and terrestrial organisms.

Their increasing use will inevitably lead to their release in the environment and aquatic ecosystems where they may represent a threat to aquatic organisms. Being a widespread and important component of the aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblage, amphipods and more specifically Gammarus fossarum will certainly be exposed to AgNPs and AuNPs. For these reasons,        G. fossarum was selected as model organism for this study. The aimof the present workwas the evaluation of the influence of both size (20, 40 and 80 nm) and surface coating (citrate CIT, polyethylene glycol PEG) on the acute toxicity of AgNPs and AuNPs on G. fossarum. We investigated the effects of AgNPs and AuNPs on the uptake by G. fossarum, NP tissue distribution and the expression of stress related genes by the use of ICP-MS, NanoSIMS50, Cytoviva (R), and Rt-qPCR, respectively.        Ag and Au bioaccumulation revealed a significant surface-coating dependence, with CIT-AgNPs and CIT-AuNPs showing the higher bio-accumulation potential in G. fossarum as compared to PEG-NPs. Opposite to that, no size-dependent effects on the bioaccumulation potential was observed. SIMS imaging and CytoViva (R) revealed an influence of the type of metal on the tissue distribution after uptake, with AgNPs detected in the cuticle and the gills of G. fossarum, while AuNPs were detected in the gut area. Furthermore, AgNPs were found to upregulate CuZnSOD gene expression while AuNPs led to its down-regulation. Modulation of SOD may indicate generation of reactive species of oxygen and a possible activation of antioxidant defence in order to prevent and defend the organism from oxidative stress. However, further investigations are still needed to better define the mechanisms underlying the observed AgNPs and AuNPs effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The present study evaluates mesoscale spatial (230 km, Catalan coast) and temporal (2007 vs 2017-2018, Barcelona area) differences on the ingestion of anthropogenic fibers in the deep-sea shrimp Aristeus antennatus in the NW Mediterranean Sea and its relation with shrimp's health condition. Synthetic fibers with lengths ranging between 0.16 and 37.9 mm were found in both stomach (where sometimes they were tangled up in balls) and intestine contents. The percentage of fiber occurrence was >65% at each sampling point. Tangled balls of fibers observed in stomach contents exhibited a wide range of sizes (up to a diameter of 1 cm) and were usually composed of fibers of different polymers, sizes and colours. Differences between locations (2018) were found, with greater fiber loads towards the south during spring and a great variability in summer, as shrimps caught off Barcelona showed a nearly thirty-times higher fiber load compared to shrimps from other localities. Highest concentrations were more likely to be related to major sources of fibers and currents in the area. Fiber load in shrimps from 2007 was comparable to that of shrimps captured in 2017 and 2018 (spring) yet a shift in the proportion of acrylic and polyester polymers was detected. No consistent effect on shrimp's health condition was found, with only a significant negative correlation found between gonadosomatic index and fibers for those shrimps with the highest values of fiber load (caught off Barcelona, summer 2018). Our findings contribute to the knowledge on plastic pollution for the NW Mediterranean Sea and highlight the potential use of this species as a sentinel species for plastic fiber contamination.

The Santa Barbara Channel is home to a number of important marine and coastal ecosystems, including the 5 islands of Channel Islands National Park, and has a variety of factors that influence marine debris accumulation. We examined the spatial variation of marine debris density and composition across the Santa Barbara Channel by quantifying marine debris on beaches of Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands and the Ventura County mainland. Debris from surveyed beaches was cataloged, weighed, and measured to compare differences in island and mainland marine debris abundance, density, and composition. Derelict fishing gear accounted for a higher proportion of marine debris on island beaches compared to mainland beaches, and marine debris items on island beaches were significantly heavier compared to debris items on mainland beaches. The majority of debris on mainland beaches comprised smaller plastic fragments and single-use plastic items, and debris accumulation rates varied by season and location. Microplastics (plastic fibers and particles <5 mm) were found in the sand of all island and mainland beaches; however, density of microplastics did not appear to correlate with density of visually observable debris items (>25 mm) that were collected during marine debris cleanups. We compared our data from 2015 and 2016 with historical surveys performed from 1989 to 1994 to examine the temporal variation of marine debris on Santa Rosa island. We found that there has been a significant increase in the amount of derelict fishing gear found on Santa Rosa Island over the past 27 years, which mirrors expansion of the California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) fishery. This study highlights the importance of marine debris monitoring as local changes in policy, fisheries, and consumer culture are reflected in accumulations of marine debris found on the California mainland and the uninhabited Channel islands. Monitoring marine debris can provide insight into anthropogenic impacts and is a useful mechanism in monitoring the health of coastal and marine ecosystems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

In this work, the marine clam Ruditapes philippinarum, selected as model organism, has been employed to investigate bioaccumulation, antioxidant enzyme activities and DNA damage due to exposure to TiO2 nanoparticles and bulk TiO2 (inorganic compounds that are frequent components of PCPs, plastics, paints and coatings, foods and disinfectant water treatments). We have also studied the joint effect of both forms of inorganic TiO2 combined with four organic compounds (mixture exposures) commonly used in PCPs: an antimicrobial (triclosan), a fragrance (OTNE) and two UV filters (benzophenone-3 and octocrylene). Bioaccumulation of the inorganic compound, TiO2, was almost immediate and constant over exposure time. With respect to the organic compounds in mixtures, they were mediated by TiO2 and bioaccumulation is driven by reduced size of the particles. In fact, nanoparticles can be considered as a vector to organic compounds, such as triclosan and benzophenone-3. After a week of depuration, TiO2 NPs and TiO2 bulk in clams showed similar levels of concentration. Some organic compounds with bioactivity (Log K-ow >3), like OTNE, showed low depuration after one week. The joint action of the organic compound mixture and either of the two forms of TiO2 provoked changes in enzyme activity responses. However, for the mixtures, DNA damage was found only after the depuration period. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Samples were characterized by various microscopic techniques (fluorescence, polarized light, SEM) in order to quantify and classify MPs and microrubbers (MRs) in the urban and industrial environments that are potentially ingestible or inhalable by humans. In < 5-mm street dust retrieved from 15 sites, there were an average of 900 MPs and 250 MRs per 15 g of sample, with MPs exhibiting a range of colours and sizes (<100 to >1000 mu m). Most street dust samples were dominated by spherical and film-like particles and MRs largely made up of different sizes of black fragments and fibrous particulates. Airborne dust collected daily over an eight-day period at two locations revealed the ubiquity of fibrous MPs of sizes ranging from about 2 mu m to 100 mu m and an abundance of about 1 per m(-3). These samples contained small MR fragments whose precise characteristics were more difficult to define. Based on the median concentrations in street dust, estimates of acute exposure through ingestion are about 5 and 15 MP d(-1) and 2 and 7 MR d(-1) for construction workers and young children, respectively. Quantities of inhalable particulates were more difficult to define but the potential toxicity of MPs and MRs taken in by this route was evaluated from assays performed using particulates isolated from street dusts in the presence of an artificial lung fluid. Both types of particle exhibited oxidative potential, with MPs displaying consumptions of different antioxidants that were comparable with corresponding values for a reference urban particulate dust but lower than those for London ambient particulate matter. Thus, MPs and MRs contribute towards the health impacts of urban and industrial dusts but their precise roles remain unclear and warrant further study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A sorption isotherm model obtained from quartz crystal microbalance measurements suggests that the akaganeite bulk can accommodate a maximum of 22.4 mg of water/g (44% bulk site occupancy) when exposed to atmospheres of up to 16 Torr water vapor. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy also showed that water molecules interact with (hydr)oxo groups on both the akaganeite bulk and surface. Diffusion reactions through the akaganeite bulk were confirmed through important changes in the hydrogen-bonding environment of bulk hydroxyl groups. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that water molecules are localized in cavities that are bound by eight hydroxyl groups, forming short-lived (<0.5 ps) hydrogen bonds with one another. Diffusion coefficients of water are three orders of magnitude lower than they are in liquid water (D = 0.0-11.1 X 10(-12) m(2).s(-1)), whereas large integral rotational correlation times are 4 to 15 times higher (tau(r) = 8.4-31.8 ps). Moreover, both of these properties are strongly loading-dependent. The simulations of the interface between the water vapor phase and the (010) surface plane of the akaganeite, where openings are exposed, revealed sluggish rates of incorporation between interfacial water species and their tunnel counterparts.

The ecological impact of MP pollution is still unknown, thus there is an urgent need for more knowledge. One key task is to identify species suitable as sentinels for monitoring in key eco-compartments, such as coastal waters. In Norway, mussels (Mytilus spp.) have been monitored for hazardous contaminants through OSPAR since 1981. Norway has the longest coastline in Europe and adding MP to the Norwegian Mussel Watch is therefore important in a European and global context. The present study reports MP data in mussels (332 specimens) collected from multiple sites (n = 15) spanning the whole Norwegian coastline. MPs were detected at all locations, except at one site on the west coast. Among the most surprising findings, mussels from the Barents Sea coastline in the Finnmark region, contained significantly more MPs than mussels from most of the southern part of the country, despite the latter sites being located much closer to major urban areas. Only mussels from a site located very close to Oslo, the capital, contained levels similar to those observed in the remote site in Finnmark. In total an average of 1.5 (+/- 23) particles ind(-1) and 0.97 (+/- 2.61) particles w.w. g(-1) was found. The most common MPs were <1 mm in size, and fibres accounted for 83% of particles identified, although there was inter-site variability. Thirteen different polymeric groups were identified; cellulosic being the most common and black rubbery particles being the second. This study suggests Mytilus spp. are suitable for semi-quantitative and qualitatively monitoring of MPs in coastal waters. However, some uncertainties remain including mussel size as a confounding factor that may influence ingestion, the role of depuration and other fate related processes, and this call for further research.

To date, sampling is mainly conducted at the surface of both rivers and lakes and only a few studies assessed the vertical distribution of MPs in the water column of freshwater bodies. To contribute to the understanding of MP pollution in the water column of freshwater lakes, this study evaluated the vertical profile of MPs in Lake Tollense considering particles between 63 and 5000 mm in size. Sampling was conducted on three occasions at three depths (surface, 7 m and 10 m) along a transect including eight sampling stations. The retrieved samples were digested with hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite and investigated via Nile Red staining and fluorescence microscopy. Subsequently, a sub sample of stained particles was verified by mRaman-spectroscopy. The vertical distribution of MPs Lake Tollense differed considerably between particle shapes (irregular particles (IPs) and fibers). Fibers did not show a noticeable pattern with depth and ranged between 22 fibers m(-3) at 0 m to 19 fibers m(-3) at 10 m. In contrast, IPs were distinctly less abundant in sub-surface samples with concentrations between 50 IPs m(-3) at 0 m to 29 IPs m(-3) at 10 m. Concerning IPs, buoyant polymers (mainly PE and PP) and concerning fibers PET and PP dominated the polymeric composition. Besides particle inherent properties, wind-induced mixing is likely affecting the intensity of vertical concentration gradients. This study highlights the need for depth-integrated sampling approaches in order to achieve representative data without overor underestimating the overall abundances. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, novel two-photon fluorescent hybrid Pdots, DA-CD@Pdots, were first prepared by poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (PSMA) being grafted with beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(1,4-benzo-{2,1',3}-thiadiazole)] (PFBT) through a nanoprecipitation method, followed by covalent attachment with dopamine (DA) by using an EDC-catalyzed carboxylamine coupling reaction. The DA molecules anchored on the surface of the Pdots were further oxidized to form their quinone-like structures (DQ) and act as good electron acceptors to magnifyingly quench the fluorescence of Pdots by intraparticle photoinduced electron transfer (PET) and the ""molecular-wire effect"". The finally achieved hybrid DQ-CD@ Pdots display enhanced colloidal stability, higher resistibility to environmental effects, and lower biological toxicity. In the presence of glutathione (GSH), DQ molecules on the surface of Pdots are reduced into catechol molecules and result in the inhibition of PET and restoration of the fluorescence of the Pdots. On the basis of the above demonstrations, the hybrid DQ-CD@Pdots are used as fluorescent probes for ""turn-on"" detection of GSH in the range from 0.01 to 3.0 mu M with the detection limit of 2.7 nM. The prepared DQ-CD@Pdots probe is also applied to the GSH detection and imaging in living systems including human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells and living zebrafish with satisfactory results.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome,3 - Intervention",,

Of note, disease treatment of amphibian animals is a big challenge facing toad farms development. Iron oxide nanoclusters (IONCs) are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as new materials for drug delivery systems development. The biodistribution and fate of IONCs in the lower vertebrate tissues such as toads is novel and should be studied in details. In this study, the biodistribution and toxicities of polyethylene glycol-functionalized IONCs (PEG-IONCs) and amine-functionalized IONCs (NH2-IONCs) in the liver and spleen of Egyptian toad were studied after intraperitoneal or oral injections. The localization and levels of IONCs in liver and spleen depends on the root of injection and the surface functionalization. The presence of IONCs in the liver and spleen produced sever to mild histological and histochemical abnormalities, but in a different ratio. The change of melanomacmphages (MMs) numbers depends on the root of injection or the function group on the surface of IONCs and this explains the abnormalities of MMs produced by IONCs treatment. Further, the function group on the surface may control the biodistribution of MMs and abnormalities produced by IONCs in the liver and spleen. Understanding the biodistribution and histological abnormalities of IONCs in the lower vertebrate tissues (amphibians in this study) might introduce important information to develop new drugs which can be used for amphibian diseases treatment or diagnosis. Further, the histopathological and MMs abnormalities produced by IONCs may consider as biomarkers for amphibians diseases diagnosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

According to previous studies, PM could be detected in the aquatic system in some area. However, the toxic effects of PM on zebrafish received very limited attention. In this study, we examined the toxic effects of various concentration of PM on the endpoints of development, locomotor behavior and oxidative stress in larval zebrafish. It was observed that PM exposure delayed embryonic development, inhibited hatchability at 60 and 72 h postfertilization and increased heart rate. After PM exposure, the larval zebrafish showed abnormal free swimming behavior and the swimming behavior in response to light-dark transition, indicating that PM had the potential to induce neurotoxicity. Moreover, PM exposure also affected the enzymatic activity of acetylcholinesterase and dopamine and the transcriptional level of genes related to neurotoxicity. In addition, PM exposure not only affects catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity but also affects the transcription level of various genes. We believed that PM induced oxidative stress was also a possible reason to cause neurotoxicity in larval zebrafish. In summary, our results suggested that PM could disturb the endpoints at development, locomotor behavior and oxidative stress in larval zebrafish. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Altogether more than 12,000 m of nets were retrieved from water column and lake bottom. Free-floating nets were effectively detected using echo sounding, whereas masses of nets accumulated at underwater obstacles were easier to detect by diving. Creeping led to removal of less numerous but actively fishing ghost nets. Ghost nets contained fish at different stages of decomposition (in addition to birds and crustaceans) indicating that abandoned gear continues fishing over extended periods.

One threat in particular that has emerged over the last 4 decades is the pollution of oceanic and coastal habitats with plastic debris. The increased occurrence of plastics in marine ecosystems mirrors the increased prevalence of plastics in society, and reflects the high durability and persistence of plastics in the environment. In an effort to guide future research and assist mitigation approaches to marine conservation, we have generated a list of 16 priority research questions based on the expert opinions of 26 researchers from around the world, whose research expertise spans several disciplines, and covers each of the world's oceans and the taxa most at risk from plastic pollution. This paper highlights a growing concern related to threats posed to marine wildlife from microplastics and fragmented debris, the need for data at scales relevant to management, and the urgent need to develop interdisciplinary research and management partnerships to limit the release of plastics into the environment and curb the future impacts of plastic pollution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

B. and Barletta, Mario and Lima, Andre R. A. and Morley, Simon A. and Costa, Monica F.",,,,,"The dynamics of microfilament (<5 mm) ingestion were evaluated in three species of snooks. The ingestion of different colours and sizes of microfilaments were strongly associated with the spatio-temporal estuarine use and ontogenetic shifts of snooks. Their feeding ecology was also analysed to assess dietary relationships with patterns of contamination. All species were highly contaminated with microfilaments. The highest ingestion of microfilaments occurred in the adults, when fishes became the main prey item and also during the peak of fishing activities, in the rainy season. This suggests that trophic transfer, in addition to periods of high availability of microfilaments are important pathways for contamination. The ingestion of microfilaments of different colours and sizes was likely influenced by input sources. Blue microfilaments were frequently ingested, and appear to have both riverine and estuarine inputs, since they were ingested in all seasons and habitats. Purple and red microfilaments were more frequently ingested in the lower estuarine habitats. The length of microfilaments was also associated with environmental variability. Longer microfilaments were ingested in habitats with greater riverine influence, the opposite was observed for shorter microfilaments. Therefore, microfilament contamination in snooks are a consequence of their ecological patterns of estuarine uses through different seasons and life history stages.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The copper lines with the width of about 200 mu m and the height of about 4 mu m were directly fabricated on silicon wafers at room temperature without masking. The results show that there is an optimum particle diameter for the impact velocity in particle collision deposition systems. In order to obtain a higher particle impact velocity in VCS, the substrate should be placed behind the high-pressure region of gas shock wave, so that the position of the high-pressure region of the free jet and the position of the bow shock with the substrate coincide as much as possible. Copper particles undergo plastic deformation and particle flattening upon impact and subsequent particle compaction.

Over the last decade, the amount of research about and attention to the topic have elevated plastic pollution to the global stage-and set priorities for research and policy. Though the story of plastic pollution, big and small, began decades ago in remote central ocean gyres, we now know that plastic debris is ubiquitous across all ocean basins, ecosystems, habitats, and food webs-including in seafood and sea salt. In addition to work on understanding contamination, researchers have expanded their breadth of questioning toward the sources, fates, transformations, and effects of plastic pollution. A deeper understanding has revealed the many ways in which plastic debris interacts with planetary cycles and affects physical and biological processes. An expanding scientific field has paralleled a growing policy movement that spans multiple levels of government from municipal to international. As we continue to conduct research to better understand plastics in our ocean, the questions are no longer about whether there is plastic pollution, but instead: (1) what are the processes and extent to which plastic debris affects global change?

To promote the clinical progress of ATA, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified liposomes were used to encapsulate ATA along with improving its bioavailability and in vivo anticancer efficiency. The resulting liposomal ATA exhibited a spherical shape with an average size of 188.5 nm. In vitro evaluations showed that liposomal ATA retained the anti-breast cancer efficacy of ATA while exerting much less cytotoxicity toward noncancerous cells. Significantly, pharmacokinetics analysis showed that the AUC(0-24h) of liposomal ATA was 59 times higher than that of free ATA, demonstrating increased bioavailability of ATA. Preclinical experiments demonstrated that liposomal ATA reduced the growth of ER-positive human breast tumor xenografts by 73% in nude mice, and the liposomal ATA exhibited a much lower level of toxicity than that of free ATA with respect to zebrafish larval mortality, body formation, and heart function during development. Moreover, 7-day and 21-day tissue toxicity levels were determined in mice by intravenous administration of a maximum dosage of liposomal ATA (120 mg/kg). The results showed no obvious tissue damage in major organs, including the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and brain. In summary, we have developed a clinical formulation of liposomal ATA with the high bioavailability and potent efficacy for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",,

Lake Ziway in the Ethiopian Rift Valley basin provides services including irrigation, drinking water and fish food in the region. This paper reviews the biological resources and spatio- temporal variation of water quality of the lake focussing on nutrients, metals and pesticides. Lake Ziway is under increasing agricultural and urban pressure and is exhibiting deteriorating trends in several water quality and ecological parameters. Nutrients and trace metals, including PO43-, NO3-, NH4+, Ca2+, Cu and Ni of the lake have shown increasing temporal trends in concentration. Spatially, higher values of major parameters (e.g. NO3-, NH4+, K, Na and electrical conductivity) were observed at shoreline sites near floriculture farming. The water quality of the lake exceeded guideline values for drinking water (alkalinity and Fe) and for aquatic life (NH+, Fe, Cr, Cu and Se). The recently reported pesticides in the lake possibly cause ecological and human health effect. Accordingly, agriculture and urbanisation are affecting water quality of Lake Ziway, with likely negative effects on human health and the lake ecosystem function unless appropriate interventions are taken. Our results may be useful in assessing other African lakes subject to similar anthropogenic pressures in their catchments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MAT: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Sardines are found internationally in many coastal environments and represent a potential sentinel species for monitoring and comparing marine plastic exposure rates. We conducted a pilot study, examining the rate of plastic ingestion in 27 commercially caught sardines (Sardinops sagax) from a low populated coastal region of Western Australia. A total of 251 potentially anthropogenic particles were extracted by chemical digestion of the gastrointestinal tract and classified visually. Fibres were the dominant type of material recovered (82.9%), with both yellow (39.8%) and black (32.7%) coloured particles commonly observed. A subset of 64 particles (25.5%), were subject to Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to identify polymer composition. This chemical characterisation identified seven plastic items (polypropylene, nylon and polyethylene) and a variety of cellulose-based material that was further examined and classified as natural or semi-synthetic. The mean plastic ingestion rate was 0.3 +/- 0.4 particles per fish, suggesting Western Australian sardines ingest relatively low concentrations of plastic when compared to international sardine populations examined using similar methodologies. Despite comparatively low concentrations, plastic and semi-synthetic material are still being ingested by sardines from a low populated coastal region demonstrating the ubiquitous nature of the marine debris problem.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The monitoring survey was carried out by a Fourier Transform Infrared Microscope System, while the ecotoxicological assessment was performed by the mussel mortality, a biomarker suite and the proteomics. The main results of the monitoring have highlighted some critical points, related to the concentration of plastics detected at Milan and, especially at the southernmost sampling station, where a daily flow of more than 6 million plastic debris has been estimated, ending directly into the Po River, the main Italian river. The ecotoxicological analysis highlighted how the toxicity is not exclusively due to the plastic concentration, but that the different characteristics of the polymers probably become more important. Furthermore, we observed an extensive mortality of bivalves exposed to the sampled mixtures in the two southernmost sampling stations, while the battery of biomarkers and the results of proteomics have highlighted how the sampled plastic mixtures caused an imbalance in the redox state, already indicated as a classic effect due to plastic exposure, but also an impact on energy stock and on some fundamental cellular pathways always linked to energy metabolism.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",,

International efforts to catalogue and quantify the density, extent and nature of mismanaged waste have not yet assessed the heterogeneity of debris between nearby areas. Better understanding of how debris types and density can be used as a proxy between regions and between land and seafloor habitats at a global scale can aid in developing cost effective and representative debris monitoring systems. Using volunteer collected clean-up and survey data, we compared the proportion and density of both total debris and specific items across 19,428 coastal land and seafloor sites from International Coastal Cleanups and Dive Against Debris surveys, from 86 countries between 2011 and 2018. We show that although some items common on land are also common on the seafloor, there is an overall global mismatch between debris types and densities on land and the seafloor from nearby areas. Correlations in land/seafloor debris type/density occurred primarily for items which entangle and/or sink, including fishing line, plastic bags, glass and poly-ethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. Minimal similarity between land and seafloor surveys occurs for items which float or degrade. We suggest that to accurately evaluate local debris density, land and seafloor surveys are required to gain a holistic understanding. When detailed information on debris type, relative concentration, and likely source and transport are assessed, more cost effective and efficient policy interventions can be designed and implemented from local through to global scales.

Marine debris was identified according to size range and distribution, and this information was related to preventive actions to improve marine waste issues. For the purpose of this study, comparison of plastic waste abundance between a recreational beach and fish-landing beaches was also carried out, since the different beach types represent different activities that produce debris. Six beaches along the Malaysian coastline were selected for this study. The plastic types in this study were related to the functions of the beach. While recreational beaches have abundant quantities of plastic film, foamed plastic including polystyrene, and plastic fragment, fish-landing beaches accumulated line and foamed plastic.

While most species cannot cope with these human impacts, others can persist or may even be favoured in these anthropogenic ecosystems. Among the different urban-adapted wildlife species, the populations of different species of opportunistic gulls have increased in urban areas and some have established breeding populations at a global scale. Although the ecology of these predators is relatively well-known in their natural environment, accurate knowledge about their urban ecology is very scarce. Here, we investigated the foraging ecology (habitat use, spatial movements and feeding) of an urban population of yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) inhabiting the city of Barcelona (north-eastern Spain). We examined the diet of this urban population by analysing the stomach contents of chicks distributed throughout the urban area of Barcelona. The foraging movements of breeding gulls were investigated using GPS devices and habitat landscape information. The results show that this urban population of yellow-legged gull exploits different food resources, highlighting the consumption of urban birds and marine resources from fishery discards. In line with the diet results, GPS tracking data indicated that although yellow-legged gulls were able to use different types of habitats close to the city, they mainly foraged in urban and fishing port areas. In conclusion, yellow-legged gulls have adapted to exploit the food resources associated with urban environments. This study provides useful information to discuss management options measures to control the yellow-legged gull populations nesting in urban areas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

However, I argue that the concept is deeply flawed; ecologically, socially and economically. Sustainability is strongly related, both historically and currently, to maximum long-term economic exploitation of a system. Counter-intuitively, in fisheries, achieving this economic exploitation often relies on government subsidies. While many fish populations are not sustainably fished biologically, even 'sustainably harvesting' fish results in major ecological changes to marine systems. These changes create unknown damage to ecosystem processes, including carbon capture potential of the ocean. The spatial scale of commercial fishing processes can also lead to social and food security issues in local, coastal communities that rely on fish for dietary needs. A radical alternative proposal is provided to the current situation. Ultimately, offshore fishing should be stopped completely and fish catches should rely instead on inshore fisheries. While such an approach may require a change in thinking and human behaviour regarding fish, I demonstrate that there are many benefits of this approach, including ecological, social and to local coastal economies, and few negatives, although management measures and coastal marine protected areas to protect vulnerable species and habitats would still be required. As such, the approach suggested is much more akin to a holistic definition of sustainability or 'prevention of ecological harm', rather than the maximum long-term exploitation of an ecosystem which is an underlying assumption of much fisheries and conservation research. While the suggestions in the study would benefit from further ecological, social and economic modelling, any movement towards restricting offshore catches should provide some degree of the benefits detailed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Matheus""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MAT: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The sediments were incubated at 28 degrees C and tested after 6 months, when clear signs of degradation were visible in the exposed samples, and after 12 months, when the samples had completely disappeared. The model organisms selected for the study were the unicellular algae Dunaliella tertiolecta, the sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) juveniles. The unicellular algae and sea urchins were used to determine the toxicological endpoint of growth inhibition and embryotoxicity, respectively, and the sea bass juveniles were tested to evaluate sublethal effect endpoints using lipid peroxidation and genotoxicity biomarkers. Elutriates of sediment inoculated with Mater-Bi for 6 and 12 months showed an absence of toxic effects in all of the model organisms exposed in this study. The Mater-Bi degradation process did not generate or transfer into the elutriates toxic substances that could cause alterations in the growth of D. tertiolecta, in the P. lividus embryo-toxicity assay or in the sensitive biomarker responses of the fish D. labrax. The tested species are considered to be representatives of different levels of the marine trophic chain.

rayyan-684570791,With the noose around the neck: Marine debris entangling otariid species,2017,1,1,ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,0269-7491,220,,985-989,"Franco-Trecu, V and Drago, M and Katz, H and Machin, E and Marin, Y and Franco-Trecu, Valentina and Drago, Massimiliano and Katz, Helena and Machin, Emanuel and Marin, Yamandu",,,,,"Plastic debris in marine environments and its impact on wildlife species is becoming a problem of increasing concern. In pinnipeds, entanglements commonly consist of loops around the neck of non biodegradable materials from fishing gear or commercial packaging, known as ""neck collars"". These entanglements can cause injuries, death by suffocation and starvation, and therefore they may add to the overall decrease in population. Our objective was to describe the entanglement of two species of otariids (Arctocephalus australis and Otaria flavescens) in the South West Atlantic Ocean. These two species have widely different population sizes and contrasting trends, being the O. flavescens population one order of magnitude lower in abundance with a negative population trend. A total number of 47 entangled individuals and the ingestion of a fishing sinker were recorded (A. australis: n = 26; O. flavescens: n = 22). For A. australis about 40% of the objects came from industrial fishing with which this species overlap their foraging areas, although also its lost or discarded gear can travel long distances. In O. flavescens 48% of observed injuries were very severe, which might indicate that they had been entangled for a long time. More than 60% of the objects came from artisanal and recreational fishing that operates within 5 nautical miles off the coast, which is probably related to coastal foraging habits of this species. Due to the frequent interaction between artisanal fisheries and O. flavescens, it is possible that entangled nets could be active gears. An important contribution to mitigate entanglements can be the development of education programs setting the scenario for effective communication, and exchange with involved fishermen to collect and recycle old fishing nets. Returning to natural fibers or replacement of the current materials used in fishing gear for biodegradable materials can also be a recommended mitigation measure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J. and Hennink, Wim E. and van Steenbergen, Mies J. and Demeester, Jo and De Smedt, Stefaan C. and Braeckmans, Kevin",,,,,"Retinal gene therapy could potentially affect the lives of millions of people suffering from blinding disorders. Yet, one of the major hurdles remains the delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids to the retinal target cells. Due to the different barriers that need to be overcome in case of topical or systemic administration, intravitreal injection is an attractive alternative administration route for large macromolecular therapeutics. Here it is essential that the therapeutics do not aggregate and remain mobile in the vitreous humor in order to reach the retina. In this study, we have evaluated the use of hyaluronic acid (HA) as an electrostatic coating for nonviral polymeric gene nanomedicines, p(CBA-ABOL)/pDNA complexes, to provide them with an anionic hydrophilic surface for improved intravitreal mobility. Uncoated polyplexes had a Z-averaged diameter of 108 nm and a zeta potential of + 29 mV. We evaluated polyplexes coated with HA of different molecular weights (22 kDa, 137 kDa and 2700 kDa) in terms of size, surface charge and complexation efficiency and noticed their zeta potentials became anionic at 4-fold molar excess of HA-monomers compared to cationic monomers, resulting in submicron ternary polyplexes. Next, we used a previously optimized ex vivo model based on excised bovine eyes and fluorescence single particle tracking (fSPT) microscopy to evaluate mobility in intact vitreous humor. It was confirmed that HA-coated polyplexes had good mobility in bovine vitreous humor, similar to polyplexes functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG), except for those coated with high molecular weight HA (2700 kDa). However, contrary to PEGylated polyplexes, HA-coated polyplexes were efficiently taken up in vitro in ARPE-19 cells, despite their negative charge, indicating uptake via CD44-receptor mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, the HA-polyplexes were able to induce GFP expression in this in vitro cell line without apparent cytotoxicity, where coating with low molecular weight HA (22 kDa) was shown to induce the highest expression. Taken together our experiments show that HA-coating of nonviral gene complexes is an interesting approach towards retinal gene therapy by intravitreal administration. To our knowledge, this is the first time electrostatic HA-coating of polyplexes with different molecular weights has been evaluated in terms of their suitability for intravitreal delivery of therapeutic nucleic acids towards the retina.
