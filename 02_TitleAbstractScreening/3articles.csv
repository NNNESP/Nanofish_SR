Metabolic disturbances in the liver are highly correlated with the pathophysiology of diseases and toxicology of contaminants. However, the effects of microplastics on the comprehensive metabolic responses of aquatic animal livers are unclear. Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach using gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry was employed to discover metabolic disorders in marine medaka (Oryzias melastigmas) liver after microplastic exposure. We found that 83 metabolites were significantly altered in marine medaka liver after 10-Î¼m and/or 200-Î¼m polystyrene microplastic (PS) exposure. Subsequent metabolic pathway analysis revealed that 33 and 28 metabolic pathways, such as glycerolipid metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, fructose and mannose metabolism, and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, were significantly altered after 10-Î¼m (PS-10) and 200-Î¼m (PS-200) PS exposure, respectively. Most monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, mannose, and ribose), organic acids (e.g., lactate, fumarate, and malate) and amino acids (e.g., alanine, serine, and leucine) significantly decreased, while most fatty acids and fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters significantly increased in marine medaka liver due to PS-10 and/or PS-200 exposure. The results indicated that PS exposure triggered inhibition of the monosaccharide metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and amino acid metabolism, and accumulation of fatty acids, fatty acid methyl and ethyl esters in marine medaka liver. The varying influences of PS-10 and PS-200 on hepatic metabolism were observed. Changes in the carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism induced by PS-10 were greater than those induced by PS-200. However, PS-200 induced the hepatic accumulation of most disaccharides and trisaccharides, including lactose, maltose, mannobiose and maltotriose, while PS-10 did not. The increased toxicity caused by PS-10 than that by PS-200 may be associated with the hepatic accumulation observed only in the group exposed to PS-10. This study provides novel insights into microplastic ecotoxicology. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 13 June 2021 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Maybe""}",,

In this commentary, a simple, inexpensive solution has been proposed to reduce microplastic pollution and its mobility via ballast water. A screening chamber (with stainless steel three layered mesh) is proposed to be attached to the existing Ballast Water Treatment Systems (BWTSs) in cargo ships to filter back-flushed sea water from BWTSs. The three layered screens (500, 300 and 100 Î¼m) will not only avoid clogging and easy separation of different size groups of microplastic particles but also help in smooth discharge of water to the sea. This technique is expected to remove a large number of microplastic particles (ranging from 0.0015 to 1020 million) from a single voyage. The proposed chamber may help to collect 0.0003â€“204 metric tons of particles/day, depending upon the geographical location of ballast intake in the global ocean. These estimations were made by considering a daily turnover of 0.033 billion tonnes of ballast water globally. This proposed screening chamber attached to the existing BWTSs in cargo ships, along with other region-specific ocean cleaning initiatives, will help in mitigating microplastic pollution in the global ocean.

MPs size was mainly distributed between 80 and 250 Âµm (60%), and their major colors were white (40%), red (25%) and blue (20%). Infrared spectral analysis revealed that most of the selected particles were identified as MPs of polypropylene and polyethylene (48.3%). The risk assessment was carried out using both the hazard index (HI) and the pollution load index (PLI). The results showed that, in this case, the decisive index is the PLI since the main difference in the MPs characteristics between the two cities is their concentration.

Although well studied in marine systems, their roles and importance in freshwater environments remain uncertain. Nevertheless, the restricted ranges and variable traits of freshwater fishes result in their communities being important receptors and strong bioindicators of MP pollution. Here, the current knowledge on MPs in freshwater fishes is synthesized, along with the development of recommendations for future research and sample processing. MPs are commonly ingested and passively taken up by numerous freshwater fishes, with ingestion patterns often related to individual traits (e.g. body size, trophic level) and environmental factors (e.g. local urbanization, habitat features). Controlled MP exposure studies highlight various effects on fish physiology, biochemistry and behaviour that are often complex, unpredictable, species-specific and nonlinear in respect of doseâ€“response relationships. Egestion is typically rapid and effective, although particles of a particular shape and/or size may remain, or translocate across the intestinal wall to other organs via the blood. Regarding future studies, there is a need to understand the interactions of MP pollution with other anthropogenic stressors (e.g. warming, eutrophication), with a concomitant requirement to increase the complexity of studies to enable impact assessment at population, community and ecosystem levels, and to determine whether there are consequences for processes, such as parasite transmission, where MPs could vector parasites or increase infection susceptibility. This knowledge will determine the extent to which MP pollution can be considered a major anthropogenic stressor of freshwaters in this era of global environmental change. Â© 2021 The Authors.

These fragments are often colonized by bacterial species in marine environments, possibly contributing to the biodegradation of such materials. However, further investigations are necessary to determine the impact of abiotic polymer weathering on biofilm adhesion, as well as the specific biofilm formation strategies employed by marine isolates. Here, we evaluate deep-sea sediment bacterial isolates for biofilm adhesion, extracellular matrix production, and polymer degradation ability. Our study focuses on high-density polyethylene (HDPE) fragments for their high durability and environmental persistence, subjecting fragments to abiotic weathering prior to bacterial colonization. Marine isolates identified as Pseudomonas sp. and Lysinibacillus sp. exhibited decreasing biofilm formation on weathered HDPE, especially over the first 24Â h of incubation. This effect was countered by increased extracellular matrix production, likely improving cell adhesion to surfaces roughened by abiotic degradation. These adhesion strategies were contrasted with a reference Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, which displayed high levels of biofilm formation on non-weathered HDPE and lower extracellular matrix production over the first 24Â h of incubation. Furthermore, our results suggest that an increase in biofilm biomass correlated with changes to HDPE structure, indicating that these strains have a potential for biodegradation of plastic fragments. Therefore, this work provides a detailed account of biofilm formation strategies and bacteria-plastic interactions that represent crucial steps in the biodegradation of plastic fragments in marine environments.

The abundance and characteristics (shape, size, and colour) of MPs were observed in the outer body, gills, intestines, and the correlations between MPs and total body length, mantle length, age, and sex were analysed. All samples were collected from the fish market surrounding the Fish Auction Market at Muara Angke Port, North Jakarta, Indonesia. MPs particles were found in the outer body and gills (226/mL) and the intestines (208/mL), with fibre, fragment, and film shapes, a size range of &lt; 0.25 to 2.0 mm, and colours including black, transparent, blue, green, red, and yellow. The total MPs did not correlate (tcount 1.401 &lt; ttable 2.145) with the total body length, and there was also no difference in MPs between mantle length/age classes (p&gt;0.05). Female cuttlefish had higher levels of MPs than males. All cuttlefish samples were contaminated with MPs. However, there is no evidence yet as to whether the MPs will cause the cuttlefish to die or become harmful to human health, and further studies are needed on these potential impacts.

Thus, we addressed the short-term effects (7 h) of polyethylene microplastics (0.1, 1.0, 10 mg/L, PE-MPs) in meagre larvae Argyrosomus regius (15 dph) in the presence/absence of food. Larval feeding behavior, oxidative stress status, neurotoxicity, and metabolic requirements were evaluated. Results showed that meagre larvae ingested PE-MPs regardless of their concentration, decreasing in the presence of food (Artemia metanauplii). The presence of PE-MPs compromised larval feeding activity at the highest concentration. Under starvation, exposed larvae activated the antioxidant defenses by increasing the total glutathione levels and inhibiting catalase activity, which seemed efficient to prevent oxidative damage. Such larvae also presented increased energy consumption potentially related to oxidative damage prevention and decreased neurotransmission. Biochemical responses of fed larvae showed a similar trend, except for LPO, which remained unaffected, except at 0.1 mg/PE-MPs/L. Our results suggest that small-sized MPs in finfish hatcheries may compromise larvae nutritional requirements, but at considerably higher levels than those reported in marine environments. Nevertheless, cumulative adverse effects due to lower MPs concentrations may occur. Â© 2021 by the authors.

One main strategy to bring these hydrophobic AIEgens into the aqueous biological environment is to encapsulate them in nanoparticles with functionalized polymeric matrices. However, exploration of reliable strategies that can afford AIE nanoparticles with uniform size and stable loading efficiency with minimized variation still remains a challenge. Here, we rationally designed amphiphilic AIEgens, constructed by a hydrophobic donor-acceptor-donor (D-A-D) core and hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain. The afforded amphiphilic AIEgens can self-assemble into uniform nanoparticles with average sizes of ~35 nm, showing an emission maximum beyond 1000 nm and quantum yields (QYs) above 10%. We then used the bright AIE nanoparticles for multiscale intravital vascular fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000â€“1700 nm) in mouse and rabbit models with a high-resolution of ~38 Î¼m and a penetration depth of ~1 cm.

Methods: The optimal formulation was characterized by surface morphology, particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, drug loading and in vitro release behavior. In vivo studies were also conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results. Results: In this study, TAC-SLNs ISG were prepared using homogenization followed by probe sonication method. The average particle size of TAC-SLNs ISG was observed to be 122.3Â±4.3 nm. Compared with TAC-SLNs, in situ gel did not increase particle size, and there was no significant difference between them. The results of viscosity measurement showed that TAC SLNs-ISG were typical of pseudo plastic systems and showed a marked increase in viscosity as temperature increased and ultimately formed a rigid gel (32Â°C). In vitro and in vivo studies illustrated the sustained release model of the drug from TAC-SLNs ISG. Animal model showed that TAC-SLNs ISG had good pharmacodynamics when compared with eye drops and SLNs.

There is still significant uncertainty surrounding the distribution and impact of marine plastic litter on ocean ecosystems, and in particular on the nano- and microplastic fractions that are difficult to observe and may be harmful to marine organisms. Current estimates of ocean plastic concentrations only account for a small fraction of the approximated 8 million tons of plastic litter entering the oceans on an annual basis. Here, we present the distribution of 100â€“500 Î¼m microplastic particles within the ocean mixed layer, covering a significant fraction of the ocean, in a near-synoptic survey. During The Ocean Race 2017/2018 edition (formerly known as Volvo Ocean Race), two yachts served as ships of opportunity that regularly took samples of microplastics on a regular schedule during their circumnavigation. This effort resulted in information on microplastic distribution along the race track in the oceanâ€™s upper, well-mixed, layer. We found concentrations ranging from 0â€“349 particles per cubic meter, but with large spatial variability. There was a tendency toward higher concentrations off south-western Europe and in the southwest Pacific, and indications of long-range transport of microplastic with major ocean currents.

The results indicated that SF/SiO26 nanocomposite with 6.0 wt% SiO2 content had the optimal comprehensive performance. The cushioning properties of SF/SiO26 nanocomposites were investigated by the static compression test. The cushioning coefficient of SF/SiO26 nanocomposite was very close to expanded polyethylene (EPE). Moreover, the fatigue properties of SF/SiO26 nanocomposites were investigated by the dynamic compressive fatigue test. SF/SiO26 nanocomposite exhibited long fatigue life (6.0 million times) and high height retention rate (99.0%), which was far greater than those of EPE (0.29 million times, 54.5%). The cushioning coefficient of SF/SiO26 nanocomposite was almost no changed before and after fatigue test, which was obviously superior to traditional cushioning material EPE.

This article aims to determine the potential for pollution and distribution of microplastics in freshwater systems, especially in the Citarum watershed area. Using a combination of literature study methods with Geographical Information Systems (GIS) analysis, this article explains that microplastic contamination has occurred along the Citarum watershed from upstream to downstream, found in water and sediment and fish samples. Facilitated by their small size and high stability in the environment, microplastics can move from the aquatic environment into the food chain and cause longterm damage. This case causes a severe threat to the quality of freshwater in the Citarum watershed. Therefore, this article can be used as a reference for managing pollution in the Citarum watershed area.

Microplastics are ingested accidentally by the marine fauna or are taken up indirectly through the food chain. These particles can accumulate in cells and tissues and affect the normal biological functions of organisms, including their defense mechanisms. There is limited information available about the response of immune cells to microplastics; the degree of uptake by the cells, the response of different organs or the impact of environmental concentrations of microplastic are matters that remain unclear. Moreover, very little is known about the toxicity of different polymer types. This study aimed to shed light on the physical impact of small microplastics (1â€“5 Î¼m) on cells from Atlantic salmon. Immune cells from intestine, blood, and head kidney were exposed to green fluorescent polyethylene microplastic (PE-MP), yellow fluorescent polystyrene microplastic (PS-MP) and both. High (50 mg/L), medium (5 mg/L), and low (0.05 mg/L) concentrations were tested for 1, 24, 48, and 72 h to study cell mortality and microplastic uptake. Quantitative data of microplastic uptake by fish immune cells were obtained for the first time by imaging flow cytometry. Salmon immune cells showed a relatively low ability to phagocytose microplastics. Less than 6% of the cells ingested the particles after 48 h of exposure to high concentrations. Cells also phagocytosed microplastics at low concentrations although at low rates (<0.1%). PE-MPs was phagocytosed by higher percentage of cells compared to PS-MPs and the former bioaccumulated in time while the latter decreased over time. However, each cell generally phagocytosed more PS-MPs particles than PE-MPs. Cells from different tissues showed different responses to the microplastic polymers. In conclusion, this study shows that immune cells of Atlantic salmon can phagocytose microplastics, and the impact is dependent on the microplastic type. PE-MPs, the most abundant polymer in the oceans and a widely used plastic in salmon aquaculture, was more easily taken up than PS-MPs. Furthermore, the study demonstrates how imaging flow cytometry can be applied in microplastics research.

Thirty six individual samples of Duri fish (Arius maculatus), Lomek (Harpodon nehereus), and Biang (Setipinna breviceps) were collected from the north and south parts of Bengkalis island with the help of local fishermen in each sampling location.

Although the abundance of microplastic in coastal waters of north Bengkalis (Malacca Straits area) were higher that that in the south of Bengkalis (Begkalis Straits area), statistically they were not significantly different (p>0.05). This was presumably due to differences in oceanographic influences such as current and waves between the two water masses as well as anthropogenic activities in both areas that can affect the spread and distribution of microplastics.

Plastic waste originating from human activities has become a massive problem in almost all the small island and coastal regions, especially in the eastern part of Indonesia. This condition is caused by poor waste management and a lack of public awareness in disposing of waste in its place, including in an area known as its marine biodiversities and marine tourism spots like Masohi in Central Maluku. Also, the composition of waste is dominated by plastic waste that cannot be decomposed in a short period, continue circulated on the ocean currents, and will be deposited in coastal areas. Furthermore, some plastic waste will break down into micro-plastics that pollute not only the environment but also marine biota, which are often consumed by humans. This situation profoundly affects the sustainability and function of aquaecosystem services in coastal areas. Therefore, a comprehensive policy and regulation, and interdisciplinary study for analysing vulnerable coastal ecosystem, and mitigating the potential risk of plastic pollution in Masohi, Central Maluku are essential to be conducted.

In the present study, the influence of irregularly shaped polystyrene microplastics (<50 Î¼m), amitriptyline, and their mixture on early life-stages of brown trout were investigated. In a first experiment, the impacts of 100, 104, and 105 particles/L were studied from the fertilization of eggs until one month after yolk-sac consumption. In a second experiment, eggs were exposed in eyed ova stages to 105, 106 particles/L, to amitriptyline (pulse-spiked, average 48 Â± 33 Î¼g/L) or to two mixtures for two months. Microplastics alone did neither influence the development of fish nor the oxidative stress level or the acetylcholinesterase activity. Solely, a slight effect on the resting behavior of fry exposed to 106 particles/L was observed. Amitriptyline exposure exerted a significant effect on development, caused elevated acetylcholinesterase activity and inhibition of two carboxylesterases.

About 3000 industries discharge their wastewater into the stream, affecting almost 19 million people who live along the river. Considering the perseverance and the prospective toxicity of microplastics (MPs), investigating their concentrations in this river is critical to help illustrate the exposure of the risks to the residents of the area and beyond. This study was focused on identifying the MPs concentrations in the water, sediment, and milkfish (Chanos chanos). A volume-reduce method by using manta trawl was used to take water samples. Sediment and milkfish samples were taken using a grab sampling method. Digestion of fish was using Fenton oxidation method according to weighted ratio (1:5) and H2O2 30% (w/v). The average MPs concentration in the river was 0.0574 Â± 0.025 particles/m3; in the seawater ponds 3.000 Â± 2.645 particles/L; and in the mixed-water ponds, where the water from the river and the sea were mixed, 0.666 Â± 0.577 particles/L. The average MPs concentration in the sediment of Citarum River was 16.666 Â± 0.577 particles/100Â g; in the seawater ponds 13.335 Â± 1.527 particles/100Â g; in the mixed-water ponds 11.665 Â± 0.577 particles/100Â g; and in the seawater 3.335 Â± 0.331 particles/100Â g. The average of MPs concentration in the gut and gills of milkfish in the seawater ponds was 2.666 Â± 2.333 particles/fish, and in the mixed-water ponds was 1.166 Â± 0.983 particles/fish. The average of MPs concentration in the milkfish tissues taken from the sea was 1.333 Â± 0.577 particles/fish; and for the ones taken from the mixed-water ponds, the concentration was 1.111 Â± 0.838 particles/fish. Using the Kruskal Wallis test to generate statistical analysis, there is a significant difference between the MPs concentrations in the water and sediment samples of Citarum River based on their locations (p value = 0.024 and 0.032 &lt; 0.05). The most dominant plastic polymers in the samples were polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). There is no correlation between the level of MPs concentrations in water and sediments and the level of MPs concentrations in milkfish. However, the existence of microplastics in every sample that came from different points in the sampling area should sound an alarm, either to the local government or residents.

Hence, MPs are more frequently perceived as first-order environmental pollutants potentially harmful to the health of many groups of organisms. To explore the current knowledge in this field, we reviewed the scientific literature (published mostly in the last 20 years) focussing on the presence of MPs in water and sediments and their impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Chinese and US scientists play a leading role in this research field. The most commonly used methods of identification and quantification of synthetic polymer particles are Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy due to their high effectiveness. However, advances in measurement analytics have resulted in the constant development of more accurate methods of collecting and detecting MPs in environmental samples, necessitating the unification of these methods to develop standard analysis procedures. Our paper summarises the current knowledge about the sources, transport and circulation of MPs in the environment, based on methods used for identification of the compounds, starting from sample collection, detection and description to their quantification in water, sediments and biota of freshwater ecosystems. This holistic approach necessitates focusing research on the importance of MPs in the EcoHealth approach, examining the impact of changes in the global ecosystems on human health.

EA was encapsulated in chitosan (CHIT) polymers then coated by eudragit S100 (ES100) microparticles. The release of EA double-coated microparticles (MPs) was tested at simulative pH values. Maximum release was observed at 24 h and pH 7.4. The cytotoxicity of EA MPs on HCT 116 colon cancer cells was synergistically improved as compared with raw EA. Cell-cycle analysis by flow cytometry suggested enhanced G2-M phase colon cancer cell accumulation. In addition, a significantly higher cell fraction was observed in the pre-G phase, which highlighted the enhancement of the proapoptotic activity of EA formulated in the double-coat mixture. Annexin-V staining was used for substantiation of the observed cell-death-inducing activity. Cell fractions were significantly increased in early, late, and total cell death. This was backed by high elevation in cellular content of caspase 3. Effectiveness of the double-coated EA to target colonic tissues was confirmed using real-time iohexol dye X-ray radiography.

However, with further weathering through UV radiation, mechanical force, and microbiological activity, most of these microplastics will degrade into nano-sized particles with exponentially higher specific surface areas compared to microplastics. Moreover, given that the hydrophobic surface of plastics adsorbs hydrophobic persistent organic pollutants (POPs), the possibility of nano-sized plastic particles potentiating POP sorption has been postulated. We developed a novel radiotracer-based method to investigate the sorption of a model POP, phenanthrene, onto the surface of two different-sized polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs). Using radiotracer analysis, we compared the transport and uptake of 14C-phenanthrene in zebrafish embryos with two different plastic particle sizes. We also evaluated whether nano-sized plastics altered the toxicity of phenanthrene and the acute sub-lethal responses to phenanthrene in zebrafish embryos. Our results demonstrate that 20 nm PS-NPs have higher sorption capacity for phenanthrene due to increased total surface area per gravimetric mass. Moreover, we demonstrate increased phenanthrene across the chorion and into zebrafish embryos with nano-sized plastics when compared to sub-micron sized plastics. Co-exposure to nano-sized plastics and phenanthrene delayed hatching and induced higher EROD activity in zebrafish embryos when compared to sub-micron sized plastics. The results of our study demonstrate that nano-sized plastics facilitate the transport and uptake of hydrophobic organic pollutants and increase both their bioavailability and potential toxicity to aquatic organisms.

In South Africa, baselines against which changes can be assessed include data from the 1970s to the 1990s on microplastics floating at sea, on macro- and microplastic beach debris, and interactions with biota. However, detecting changes in the abundance of microplastics at sea is complicated by high spatial and temporal heterogeneity in net samples. Beach debris data are easier to gather, but their interpretation is complicated by the dynamic nature of debris fluxes on beaches and the increase in beach cleaning effort over time. Sampling plastic ingested by biota is a powerful approach, because animals that retain ingested plastic for protracted periods integrate plastics over space and time, but there are ethical issues to using biota as bioindicators, particularly for species that require destructive sampling (e.g. turtles, seabirds). Bioindicators could be established among fish and invertebrates, but there are technical challenges with sampling microplastics smaller than 1 mm. Fine-scale debris accumulation on beaches provides an index of macroplastic abundance in coastal waters, and offers a practical way to track changes in the amounts and composition of debris in coastal waters. However, upstream flux measures (i.e. in catchments, rivers and storm-water run-off) provide a more direct assessment of mitigation measures for land-based sources. Similarly, monitoring refuse returned to port by vessels is the best way to ensure compliance with legislation prohibiting the dumping of plastics at sea. Significance: â€¢ Monitoring is required to assess whether mitigation measures to reduce waste plastics at sea are making a difference. â€¢ Monitoring the leakage of plastic from land-based sources is best addressed on land (e.g. in storm drains and river run-off) before the plastic reaches the sea. â€¢ Illegal dumping from ships is best addressed by monitoring the use of port waste reception facilities. â€¢ Sampling plastic ingested by biota is a powerful approach, using fish and invertebrates as bioindicators for larger microplastic fragments.

Therefore, Citespace II is used to systematically analyze the related literature in order to comprehensively understand the research state of freshwater microplastics. The results show that there is still a large gap between research on freshwater and marine microplastics. Studies on freshwater microplastics have mainly been undertaken in developed countries such as the United States and Germany, while fewer studies have been conducted in the developing countries which face the most serious plastic pollution. Most studies focus on the rivers and lakes, but other freshwater sources with microplastic pollution, such as groundwater and reservoirs, have received less attention.

Lake Ontario had the highest abundances of any Great Lake to date with an average of over 230,000 particles/km2. Though having a considerable smaller average of ~45,000 particles/km2, Lake Erie remains second only to Lake Ontario based on studies to date and averaged across all samples and years. The high levels of pelagic plastic pollution is likely owing to their position as the last two lakes in the Laurentian Great Lakes ecosystem, as well as the prominence of population centers along their shorelines. As with previous studies, most particles were found within the smallest size classification (0.355â€“0.999 mm; 73%), with fragments (63%) and pellets (26%) forming the dominant morphologies. The minor contribution of fibers/lines (4%) is consistent with previous Great Lakes studies, though not with studies within other environmental compartments (e.g., sediment, fish, atmospheric). This could be due to the negative buoyancy of polymeric fibrous materials, a hypothesis consistent with the dominance of the less dense polymers polyethylene (46%) and polypropylene (43%) (based on FTIR analysis). For the first time, the multiyear Lake Erie samples were compared to modeled plastic distributions and found to fit reasonably well. Using the sample data to calibrate the model we estimate that there are 475 million plastic particles, with a total mass of 6.45 metric tons, floating on the surface of Lake Erie alone.

In the present study, in order to explore the bioaccumulation characteristics of microplastics and heavy metals in organisms, we selected eight dominant freshwater fish species in the Lake Poyang and Raohe River as the research materials. The concentrations of heavy metals (i.e. Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn and Cr) and microplastics in the fishes were measured and analyzed. The results indicated that the abundance of microplastics in water environment ranged from 10 to 64 items/L, with an average of 38.56 items/L. The abundance of microplastics in the digestive tract of the eight fish species ranged from 1.21 to 9.11 items/g, with an average of 5.40 items/g, while the abundance of microplastics in gills of fish varied between 0.61 and 5.00 items/g, with a mean of 2.87 items/g. There were four types of microplastics in fishes including debris, fibers, films and pellets. The polymer components were mainly polyethylene (PE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) that were mainly transparent and colorful. The particle size of microplastics ranged from 0.01 to 9.50 mm, and 79.07% of the microplastics had particle size>0.5 mm. The abundance characteristics (i.e. types, particle size, color and polymer composition) of microplastics in fishes were similar as those in water environment. The averaged bioaccumulation coefficient of microplastics in fishes was 178.29. The bioaccumulation ability of microplastics in fishes was ordered as follows: Channa argus, Pelteobagrus fulvidraco > Hemicculter leuciclus, Ctenopharyngodon idellus, Silurus asotus > Cyprinus carpio, Coilia ectenes, Carassius auratus. The contents of heavy metals including Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn and Cr in the muscle tissues of fishes were 4.27 mg/kg, 0.13 mg/kg, 0.28 mg/kg, 11.73 mg/kg and 0.53 mg/kg, respectively, which meet the requirements of pollution-free aquatic products and are lower than the health standards for human consumption. The enrichment ability of the fishes to the five heavy metals was ordered as follows: Zn>Cu>Cd>Pb>Cr. Different fish species showed different ability on the accumulation of a specific type of heavy metals, which is closely related to their feeding habits. The five heavy metals were detected on the surface of various microplastics by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) methods, suggesting that microplastics may be the attachment carrier of heavy metal pollutants. Correlation analyses showed that the concentration of microplastics in fishes were significantly correlated with that of Cu, Cd and Pb, probably because that the presence of microplastics enhances the cumulative effects of Cu, Cd and Pb, and lead to the compound pollution effects.

One of these is the consequences of the improper discarding of plastic in the environment and its eventual fragmentation into microplastics. Plastic can reach rivers and affect their biota as microparticles from its degradation. The entry of plastic into the food chain occurs by the consumption of fish or other organisms. Furthermore, persistent organic pollutants can accumulate, and the consumption of materials containing plastic pollutants can cause several physiological problems in animals. Such pollutants can reach man when water or fish is consumed. There are numerous studies in the marine environment that show that microplastics significantly interfere with marine biota; but there are relatively few studies addressing this topic in freshwater environments. This work characterized the diet of the most abundant fish species in an urban river of the Upper ParanÃ¡ Brazil Watershed, investigating the occurrence of microplastic. As much as the studied river suffers from urban river syndrome, a wide variety of food consumed by fish was found. The stomach content of 220 individuals belonging to fourteen species was analyzed. In the stomach content analysis, 16 types of food items were found, most of them autochthonous. The species analyzed were grouped into four trophic categories, with iliophage as dominant one. The presence of microplastics was found in 2% of the studied individuals, two individuals of the species Rhamdia quelen, one specimen of Hoplosternum littorale and one specimen of Astyanax fasciatus.

Unfortunately, million tons of plastic end up in the sea becoming one of the biggest current environmental problems. One way to monitor the amount of plastic in beaches is to collect samples and visually count and sort the plastic particles present in them. This is a very time-consuming task. In this work, we present a Computer Vision-based system which is able to automatically count and classify microplastic particles (1-5 mm) into five different visual classes. After cleaning a collected sample in the lab, the proposed system makes use of a pair of its images with different characteristics. The procedure includes a segmentation step, which is based on the Sauvola thresholding method, followed by a feature extraction and classification step. Different features and classifiers are evaluated as well as a deep learning approach. The system is tested on 12 different beach samples with a total of 2507 microplastic particles. The particles of each sample were manually counted and sorted by an expert. This data represents the ground truth, which is compared later with the results of the automatic processing proposals to evaluate their accuracy. The difference in the number of particles is 34 (1.4%) and the error in their classification is less than 4% for all types except for the line shapes particles. These results are obtained in less than half of the time needed by the human expert doing the same task manually. This implies that it is possible to process more than twice as many samples using the same time, allowing the biologists to monitor wider areas and more frequently than doing the process manually.

This might adversely affect daphnid and copepod populations in the long term. In contrast, molluscs, barnacles, brine shrimp and euphausids appear to be more tolerant to MPs. No clear impacts on survival, development time, growth or feeding rate can be observed in these zooplankton groups at any of the MP concentrations tested, suggesting that these groups might become more dominant with prolonged exposure to MP pollution. Leachates derived from MPs can induce severe abnormality in bivalve and sea urchin embryos. MPs have prominent effects on survival and fecundity of F1 offspring in bivalves, copepods and daphnids, indicating that MPs could incite transgenerational effects and drastically affect sustainability in zooplankton populations.

While the prevalence of nanoparticle drug-delivery systems reported in the literature increases yearly, relatively little translation from the bench to the bedside has occurred. It is crucial for the scientific community to recognize this shortcoming and re-evaluate standard practices in the field, to increase clinical translatability. Currently, nanoparticle drug-delivery systems are designed to increase circulation, target disease states, enhance retention in diseased tissues, and provide targeted payload release. To manage these demands, the surface of the particle is often modified with a variety of chemical and biological moieties, including PEG, tumor targeting peptides, and environmentally responsive linkers. Regardless of the surface modifications, the nanoâ€“bio interface, which is mediated by opsonization and the protein corona, often remains problematic. While fabrication and assessment techniques for nanoparticles have seen continued advances, a thorough evaluation of the particleâ€™s interaction with the immune system has lagged behind, seemingly taking a backseat to particle characterization. This review explores current limitations in the evaluation of surface-modified nanoparticle biocompatibility and in vivo model selection, suggesting a promising standardized pathway to clinical translation.

The samples were treated by hydrogen peroxide with the iron (II) sulfate as a catalyst to remove organic components and inspected under a microscope with different size ranges. The total number of MPs were found to be 41.77 particles/m3. The presence of different types of MPs was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy, with a predominant abundance of polypropylene, polyamide 6, and polyethylene. Potential origins of these type of polymers are from plastic nets of aquatic farms and plastic films from mulching employed for cultivation.

In the supraglacial debris of the Forni Glacier (Italian Alps), we observed the occurrence of (mean Â± standard error) 74.4 Â± 28.3 items kgâˆ’1 of sediment (dry weight).

Microplastic can be released directly into high elevation areas by human activities in the mountain or be transported by wind to high altitude. The occurrence of microplastic on Forni Glacier may be due to the gathering of debris coming from the large accumulation area into the relatively smaller ablation area of the glacier, as a consequence of its flow and melting.

All suspected MPs were characterized according to their polymer nature using micro-Raman spectroscopy. The investigated WWTP had an estimated daily discharge of 227 million MPs.

However, the currently available methods require long fixation periods, thereby necessitating the development of alternative methods to accelerate the healing process between tendons and bones. Thus, we developed and evaluated a novel technique that utilizes silicate-substituted strontium (SrSiP). Methods: PET films, nano-coated with SrSiP, were prepared. Bone marrow mesenchymal cells (BMSCs) from femurs of male rats were cultured and seeded at a density of 1.0 Ã— 104/cm2 onto the SrSiP-coated and non-coated PET film, and subsequently placed in an osteogenic medium. The osteocalcin concentration secreted into the medium was compared in each case. Next, PET artificial ligament, nano-coated with SrSiP, were prepared. BMSCs were seeded at a density of 4.5 Ã— 105/cm2 onto the SrSiP-coated, and non-coated artificial ligament, and then placed in osteogenic medium. The osteocalcin and calcium concentrations in the culture medium were measured on the 8th, 10th, 12th, and 14th day of culture. Furthermore, mRNA expression of osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2), and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) was evaluated by qPCR. We transplanted the SrSiP-coated and non-coated artificial ligament to the tibiae of mature New Zealand white rabbits. Two months later, we sacrificed them and histologically evaluated them. Results: The secretory osteocalcin concentration in the medium on the film was significantly higher for the SrSiP group than for the non-coated group. Secretory osteocalcin concentration in the medium on the artificial ligament was also significantly higher in the SrSiP group than in the non-coated group on the 14th day. Calcium concentration on the artificial ligament was significantly lower in the SrSiP group than in the non-coated group on the 8th, 10th, 12th, and 14th day. In qPCR as well, OC, ALP, BMP2, and Runx2 mRNA expression were significantly higher in the SrSiP group than in the non-coated group. Newly formed bone was histologically found around the artificial ligament in the SrSiP group. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that artificial ligaments using SrSiP display high osteogenic potential and thus may be efficiently used in future clinical applications.

Yet the fact that particles in deeper layers are transported by currents that are different from those at the surface has not been explored so far. We compute 10-year trajectories of 1Â million virtual particles with the Parcels framework for different particle advection scenarios to investigate the effect of near-surface currents on global particle dispersal. We simulate the global-scale transport of passive microplastic for (i) particles constrained to different depths from the surface to 120-m depth, (ii) particles that are randomly displaced in the vertical with uniform distribution, (iii) particles subject to surface mixing, and (iv) for a 3-D passive advection model. Our results show that the so called â€œgarbage patchesâ€ become more â€œleakyâ€ in deeper layers and completely disappear at about 60-m depth. At the same time, subsurface currents can transport significant amounts of microplastic from subtropical and subpolar regions to polar regions, providing a possible mechanism to explain why plastic is found in these remote areas. Finally, we show that the final distribution in the surface turbulent mixing scenario with particle rise speed wr = 0.003Â m/s is very similar to the distribution of plastic at the surface. This demonstrates that it is not necessary to incorporate surface mixing for global long-term simulations, although this might change on more local scales and for particles with lower rise speeds.

All streams contained microplastics with concentrations similar to that found in larger systems (up to 303 particles mâˆ’3 in water and 80 particles kgâˆ’1 in sediment). The most abundant types were fragments and small particles (63â€“500 Î¼m). Chemical types of plastic were quite variable and often not predictable based on size, form and colour.

Here, we determined the microplastic loads and removal efficiencies of three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with different treatment sizes, operations and service compositions discharging to Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, USA over the course of a year. Overall, we found that MP concentrations (counts per L) varied within a factor of 2.5 in influent and 4.8 in effluent at each WWTP, and that neither concentrations nor removal efficiencies demonstrated a seasonal trend. The largest wastewater treatment plant in the study, which also employed primary clarification, had the highest MP removal efficiency of 97.6 Â± 1.2%. The other two smaller facilities had average removal efficiencies of 85.2 Â± 6.0% and 85.5 Â± 9.1%. We demonstrate through source modeling that microplastic fiber loads in influent were consistent with service area populations laundering textiles given previously published rates of microplastic generation in washing machines. Using measured WWTP flow rates and MP counts, we find a combined load of MPs leaving all three WWTPs with discharged effluent totaling 500â€“1000 million MPs per day. We estimate from this the emission of 0.34â€“0.68 g MP per capita per year in treated wastewater, which may only account for <0.1% of plastic debris input to this metropolitan area's surface waters on an annual mass basis when land-based (mis)managed plastic waste sources are also considered. However, the potential for sorption of chemicals present in wastewater to microplastics and their small size, which confers immediate bioaccessibility, may present unique toxicological risks for microplastics discharged from WWTPs.

In the context of oil spill modelling, there are numerous papers discussing entrainment of surface oil by breaking waves. However, for the opposite process, i.e., droplets reaching the surface and joining the surface slick, we have found no discussion in the literature of the exact steps involved. Given the wide use of particle-based models in oil spill modelling, it is important to establish a consistent recipe for treating the surface boundary. We investigate a Lagrangian particle model for the vertical transport, surfacing and resuspension of buoyant material in the water column. By modifying the behaviour at the surface boundary, the model can be applied to materials such as oil droplets, that form a surface slick, and hence see the surface as an absorbing boundary, and to particles that do not form a surface slick, such as fish eggs and microplastics. For slick-forming materials, we also consider resuspension from the surface slick, (e.g., entrainment of surface oil by breaking waves). While we restrict our attention to positively buoyant materials, the model is equally applicable to the settling of negatively buoyant particles, such as sediment grains and marine snow. We consider three case studies, each designed to allow a detailed and direct comparison of the Lagrangian model to an Eulerian model based on numerical solution of the advection-diffusion-reaction equation. We demonstrate that the two models give the same results when the boundary at the surface is treated correctly.

Although larval piscivory was reported in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), the most important spawning grounds of this species in the W Atlantic, trophic studies have not been able to reveal piscivory in Mediterranean ABFT larvae. This study analyzes the trophic behavior of Mediterranean ABFT larvae by stomach content analysis. The results show that more than 90% of the larvae had at least one prey in their stomachs. The diet shifted from copepods and cladocerans to gastropod larvae in pre-flexion stages and to ABFT larvae in post-flexion stages. This is the first time that cannibalism is reported for wild ABFT larvae from the Mediterranean Sea. Intracohort cannibalistic feeding was observed when the requisite density-dependent processes aligned, namely the spatio/temporal overlap of a wide range of ABFT larval cohorts of different size class. Moreover, stomach contents of ABFT larvae revealed the ingestion of microplastic fibres. Whether these plastic contaminants were passively or actively ingested, they may affect the condition of larvae.

A total of 80 samples were taken along four transects, and plastic particles (â‰¥1 mm) were extracted and quantified. In total, 1939 microplastic particles were recovered, with an average of 96.8 particles per 1 m2. Statistical analysis showed that the backshore had significantly more microplastic particles than the supra littoral or intertidal. Extrapolating the numbers of plastic particles found, approximately 6.8 million plastic particles (â‰¥1 mm) weighing about 250.4 kg should be found in the surface layer of Xialiao Beach. Resampling curves were created from the data set, which showed that at minimum 20 samples should be taken to adequately estimate the mean particle abundance.

Unfortunately, their rapid integration into daily life has also led to environmental concerns due to uncontrolled release of nanoparticles into the aquatic environment. Despite increasing awareness of nanoparticle bioaccumulation in the aquatic environment, much remains to be learned about their impact on aquatic organisms and how to best monitor these effects. Herein, we provide the first review of innate immunity as an emerging tool to assess the health of fish following nanoparticle exposure. Fish are widely used as sentinels for aquatic ecosystem pollution and innate immune parameters offer sensitive and reliable tools that can be harnessed for evaluation of contamination events. The most frequent biomarkers highlighted in literature to date include, but are not limited to, parameters associated with leukocyte dynamics, oxidative stress, and cytokine production. Taken together, innate immunity offers finite and sensitive biomarkers for assessment of the impact of nanoparticles on fish health. Copyright Â© 2019 Torrealba, More-Bayona, Wakaruk and Barreda.

It is well-known that the substances produced by humans leave some waste at target locations and this waste is spread in various environments, where, in soils, micro- and nanopollutants are adsorbed and degraded better than in aquatic systems. Current global plastic production is 320 million tons (Mt) per year. A doubling in the next 20Â years is expected and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are seen as primary barriers against the spread of micro- and nanopollutants, particularly when they are equipped with activated carbon adsorption, advanced oxidation processes, nano-filtration, reverse osmosis, or membrane bioreactors. Administration, WWTP, and soil management sectors will have to improve not only plastic recycling but also to develop a micro- and nanotechnology steering strategy; various fields in science and industry are active in this technology with the aims of improving health and food quality and security and reducing plant diseases. Various cost- and time-pressure aspects drive the emerging of miniaturization processes at a very rapid pace. Particularly important in diagnostic, medical, and food analysis applications are mechanical and electro-mechanical elements, embedded microfluidic devices, and fabricated micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). Small chips can contain many of the required components of a typical room-sized laboratory, and MEMS challenge recycling and investigative specialists. In our Plastocene world, our concerned aims in regard to WWTPs and agriculture are to understand when microorganisms or plants experience positive, adverse, and inhibitory effects of nano-sized metals and their oxides, such as Ag, Cu, CuO, Cu-chitosan, Zn, ZnO, Fe, Mn, Al, Au, CeO2, TiO2, and SiO2; and how micro- and nanopollutant recycling can be solved. Discussed in this chapter are the limitations and perceptions in organizing the Plastocene world, which is increasingly suffering from the spreading of micro- and nanoplastics.

The most important ecological theory achieved is that the seasonal fluctuation of the salinity gradient creates an ecocline influenced by gradual changes between river-dominated to marine-like waters. Estuarine fish fauna adapts to these changeable abiotic characteristics, including the spatial, and seasonal bioavailability of dissolved oxygen and numerous pollutants. However, studies on the influence of the estuarine ecocline are still missing for key estuarine systems. This study provides an overview of fish ecology and anthropogenic impacts within estuarine systems of SA and discusses priorities for environmental conservation. Research on fish reached important conclusions regarding essential habitats and fish interaction with other biological and abiotic compartments over spatio-temporal settings, including conditions of severe anthropogenic impacts. These impacts are related to unplanned urban settlements, industrial estates, ports, damming of major rivers, dredging activities, and deforestation for extensive farming. Changes in estuarine morphology alter natural flows and lead to habitat losses, disrupting the ecocline and impairing fishes from moving among formerly connected habitats, especially earlier ontogenetic phases. In addition, industrial, urban, and farming activities often result in high loads of metals and persistent organic pollutants, organic enrichment and oxygen depletion. Moreover, plastic debris, a ubiquitous contaminant with sources on every human activity, including fishing, when fragmented into microplastics, become preferably concentrated in semi-enclosed environments, as estuaries. Metals, POPs and microplastics are actually asserted to be persistent. When in high concentrations, they become bioavailable to the estuarine trophic web through bioaccumulation, being biomagnified or biotransfered toward higher trophic level organisms, such as top predator fishes. Therefore, research on environmental quality and fish ecology must be based on robust sampling designs along the whole ecocline using long-term approaches. In addition, basic sanitation, co-management, an improved licensing system and scientifically-based risk assessments/monitoring for all sorts of enterprise are also urgent. These conservation priorities need to be in place before human-driven changes surpass the ecosystem's capacity to produce resources and maintain services.

Today, plastic products can be found in diverse fields, such as healthcare, energy generation and automotive industries, construction, electronics, packaging and textiles, as well as at the household level. In the last few decades, global production of plastic has increased by 500% (more than 322 million tons in 2016) and almost 10% of the annual production has ended up into the. Plastic waste is transported to landfills, and a part of it is carried away by winds.

Historically, floating plastic has been reported in the Northern Hemisphere subtropical gyres since the early 1970s in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and in the Southern Hemisphere. These gyres are formed by circular surface currents created by Ekman currents, driven by local wind, and the Coriolis force (spinning of the Earth).

Rivers and wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) transport annually several million tons of MP into freshwaters, estuaries and oceans, where they provide increasing artificial surfaces for microbial colonization. As knowledge on MP-attached communities is insufficient for brackish ecosystems, we conducted exposure experiments in the coastal Baltic Sea, an in-flowing river and a WWTP within the drainage basin. While reporting on prokaryotic and fungal communities from the same set-up previously, we focus here on the entire eukaryotic communities. Using high-throughput 18S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed the eukaryotes colonizing on two types of MP, polyethylene and polystyrene, and compared them to the ones in the surrounding water and on a natural surface (wood). More than 500 different taxa across almost all kingdoms of the eukaryotic tree of life were identified on MP, dominated by Alveolata, Metazoa, and Chloroplastida. The eukaryotic community composition on MP was significantly distinct from wood and the surrounding water, with overall lower diversity and the potentially harmful dinoflagellate Pfiesteria being enriched on MP. Co-occurrence networks, which include prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa, hint at possibilities for dynamic microbial interactions on MP. This first report on total eukaryotic communities on MP in brackish environments highlights the complexity of MP-associated biofilms, potentially leading to altered microbial activities and hence changes in ecosystem functions.

The study focused on the presence of plastic debris in the stomach contents of some economically important fish caught in the lower Gulf of Thailand between January to April 2018. Size and weight range of the samples were 7.6 to 21.9 cm and 4 to 99 gm. Results highlighted the ingestion of plastics in the 54.29% samples. The ingested plastics were microplastics (27.27%; <5 mm), mesoplastics (69.88%; 5-25 mm) and macroplastic, (2.85%; >25 mm). Fibres were the major forms of plastics found during this study. These preliminary findings underlined the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in the lower Gulf of Thailand marine biota, as well as the water column where pelagic fish live, and feed and it also representd an urgency to reduce the use of plastics or to ensure the proper recycling it.

We present the results of a systematic review of the literature to assess the weight of evidence for microplastics causing environmental harm. We conclude that microplastics do occur in surface water and sediments. Fragments and fibers predominate, with beads making up only a small proportion of the detected microplastic types. Concentrations detected are orders of magnitude lower than those reported to affect endpoints such as biochemistry, feeding, reproduction, growth, tissue inflammation and mortality in organisms. The evidence for microplastics acting as a vector for hydrophobic organic compounds to accumulate in organisms is also weak. The available data therefore suggest that these materials are not causing harm to the environment. There is, however, a mismatch between the particle types, size ranges, and concentrations of microplastics used in laboratory tests and those measured in the environment. Select environmental compartments have also received limited attention. There is an urgent need for studies that address this mismatch by performing high quality and more holistic monitoring studies alongside more environmentally realistic effects studies. Only then will we be able to fully characterize risks of microplastics to the environment to support the introduction of regulatory controls that can make a real positive difference to environmental quality.

The low frequency of AMD colonized by oceanic biota (bryozoans, lepadid barnacles) suggests that most litter items from coastal waters of the Humboldt Current System (HCS) are pulled offshore into the South Pacific Subtropical Gyre (SPSG). The highest densities of floating micro- and macroplastics are reported from the SPSG. An extensive survey of photographic records, unpublished data, conference proceedings, and published studies revealed interactions with plastics for 97 species in the SE Pacific, including 20 species of fish, 5 sea turtles, 53 seabirds, and 19 marine mammals. Sea turtles are most affected by interactions with plastics, underlined by the fact that 4 of the 5 species suffer both from entanglement and ingestion. Reports gathered in this review suggest that interactions along the continental coast are mostly via entanglement. High frequencies of microplastic ingestion have been reported from planktivorous fish and seabirds inhabiting the oceanic waters and islands exposed to high densities of microplastics concentrated by oceanic currents in the SPSG. Our review also suggests that some species from the highly productive HCS face the risk of negative interactions with AMD, because food and plastic litter are concentrated in coastal front systems. In order to improve the conservation of marine vertebrates, especially of sea turtles, urgent measures of plastic reduction are needed.

Specifically, NPs were observed to accumulate in the cavities of lateral neuromasts in the skin, which coincided with an increased local expression of il1Î². Exposure to CuNPs triggered the strongest transcriptional changes in pro-inflammatory-related genes and was also observed to increase migration of neutrophils in the tail, indicating a NP-specific inflammatory response. This is the first in vivo evidence for waterborne NP exposure triggering alterations of immune system regulating genes in the skin and intestine of zebrafish embryos. The observed molecular responses have the potential to be linked to adverse effects at higher levels of biological organization and hence might be used for screening purposes in nanotoxicology or as building blocks for adverse outcome pathways.

This is the first report of plastic in South Pacific fish, raising concerns about the transfer of pollutants in a region that is largely oceanic and heavily dependent on seafood. The remote locations of the study also provide evidence of the widespread nature of this issue. (Image presented).

The atolls have not been inhabited for about 50 years apart from a military facility located in the southernmost atoll of Diego Garcia. All 640,000 km2 of territorial waters except those immediately around Diego Garcia were declared a no-take MPA in 2010. Shallow substrate consists mainly of coral reefs, though there are also some large patches of seagrass, but most of the area has not been explored scientifically. Until recently, the archipelago probably contained half of all reefs in the Indian Ocean that remained in good condition, supporting a reef fish biomass 6-20 times greater than anywhere else in that ocean. Between the atolls and banks, and further offshore, water is a few km deep. Changes to the reefs in the past few years have been drastic, with near-complete mortality of corals and soft corals in water to at least 15 m depth on all atolls that have been examined to date. Mortality was caused by warming water; measurements show that the average water temperature at several depths has risen from between 0.3Â°C and 0.5Â°C over the past decade. Levels of marine pollution are extremely low for all analyzed substances except for marine-borne litter and microplastics. The area is an important reference site because here ecological changes are caused entirely by ocean warming, without confounding effects from human use and pollution. On islands, the ecology was badly damaged during the 200 years of coconut plantation, but some recovery in the past few decades is noted. Management is minimal and needs to be strengthened to ensure that poaching is reduced, and to help return some islands to a pre-man condition to allow the bird life to increase. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Retention of polystyrene microplastics of different sizes (10 nm to 1 Î¼m) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) gills and their effects on the damage caused by anthracene to DNA of gill cells were investigated. It was demonstrated that 20 and 50 nm polystyrene particles could be retained in zebrafish gills whereas particles of bigger sizes (200, 500, or 1000 nm) were not found on the gill surface. The retained microplastics could be cleared when the zebrafish had not been exposed to microplastics for one week. The 500 nm polystyrene particles had a slight adverse effect on DNA of gill cells, and exposure to anthracene alone caused significant damage to DNA. Addition of 500 nm polystyrene particles together with anthracene effectively mitigated the damage of anthracene to gill cell DNA.

Dissections of juvenile fish guts require precise handling, which can affect the processing time if sample numbers are high. To investigate the efficacy of nitric acid (HNO3) in aiding the isolation of microplastics using whole fish, we digested juvenile glassfish, Ambassis dussumieri (Cuvier, 1828), at room temperature and at 80Â Â°C. For a complete digestion, overnight incubation in 10Â mL of 55% analytical-reagent (AR) HNO3 was sufficient for a whole fish of 1Â g at room temperature. When coupled with elevated temperature, the digestion time is shortened to a few minutes and larger fish of 3Â g can be digested in 30Â min. Four of the five types of plastic survived the process, with nylon being the exception. This is a shortfall to the method; however, until a better method replaces it, we still value the use of HNO3 for its simple, inexpensive, swift and complete digestions of whole fish. Four fish species from two feeding guilds were digested using this method to validate its use. The number of plastic particles ingested did not differ between benthic and pelagic species and microplastic fibres comprised the majority of the plastic types found.

The NPs comprised of t-BPITBT-TPE aggregates encapsulated within 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol) (DSPE-mPEG) micelles exhibit a photoluminescence peak at 660 nm with a high fluorescence quantum yield of 32% in aqueous media.

The biocompatibility, toxicity, circulation, and biodistribution of the NPs are assessed using the zebrafish model through whole embryo soaking and intravenous delivery. Furthermore, HeLa and MCF-7 cells tagged with t-BPITBT-TPE in DSPE-PEG-NH2-TAT polymer NPs are xenografted into zebrafish larvae to successfully track the cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, demonstrating that these new NPs are efficient cancer cell trackers.

By using this newly developed pipeline it was possible to analyse datasets from focal plane array (FPA) Î¼FTIR mapping of samples containing up to 1.8 million single spectra. All spectra were compared against a database of different synthetic and natural polymers by various routines followed by benchmark tests with focus on accuracy and quality. The spectral correlation was optimized for high quality data generation, which allowed image analysis. Based on these results an image analysis approach was developed, providing information on particle numbers and sizes for each polymer detected. It was possible to collect all data with relative ease even for complex sample matrices.

The hydrophobicity of treated fabrics was characterised by water contact angle measurement and UV protection properties of fabric were assessed by Australian/New Zealand Standard. Also, a colouring effect of treatment on nylon fabric was measured using spectrophotometer. Findings: The modified fabric not only exhibited superhydrophobicity with the water contact angle of 150.6Â°, but also rendered excellent protection against UV radiation. The fabric showed retention of hydrophobic and UV protection properties up to 20 washing cycles.

Here we investigated how silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with different surface chemistries affect community health, and how increased trophic complexity affects the interactions between organisms and nanomaterials. We compared AgNP exposures in simple microcosms comprised of algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) and bacteria (Escherichia coli) to increasingly complex microcosms containing predatory invertebrates (Daphnia magna) and developing vertebrates (Danio rerio). Each microcosm was exposed to one of three 70 nm AgNPs [polyethylene glycol (PEG-AgNP), silica (Si-AgNP), or aminated silica-coated AgNP (Ami-Si-AgNP)] at 0, 0.1, 1, and 5 mg Lâˆ’1 to investigate the relative influence of surface charge, composition and dissolution on organismal uptake and toxicity. All three AgNPs released more dissolved Ag into solution when organisms were present than was measured in the same media without organisms. PEG-AgNPs had the highest overall toxicity in all scenarios, followed by Si-AgNPs, and lastly Ami-Si-AgNPs. Toxicity correlated with the amount of Ag measured in the exposure media and the amount taken up by the organisms. Our findings indicate that surface functionalization plays an important role in determining dissolution, uptake and toxicity of AgNPs. Increasing trophic complexity decreased organismal susceptibility under the same AgNP concentration exposures, likely due to the change in bioavailable Ag that each organism experienced. This implies that tests using individual species provide conservative estimates of environmental impacts, while exposure may be mitigated in more realistic multi-species scenarios like those found in nature.

This enhancement causes a boost of the optical trapping force by 3 orders of magnitude. The gradient force in the vertical direction is also calculated semi-analytically by using a dipole approximation of a scattering polystyrene nanosphere, and the analytical solution well matches the full-wave simulations. Mode polarization effects are discussed in this paper as a way to switch trapping. These investigations indicate that the patterned Si3 N4 trench waveguide is suitable for optical trapping and nanoparticle sensing applications.

Its management requires antifungals to penetrate the ocular tissue. Oral use of Ketoconazole (KTZ), the first broad-spectrum antifungal to be marketed, is now restricted to life-threatening infections due to severe adverse effects and drug-interactions. Local use of KTZ loaded nanocarrier system can address its toxicity, poor solubility, photodegradation, permeation and bioavailability issues. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) comprising CompritolÂ® 888 ATO and PEG 600 matrix, were presently prepared using hot high-pressure homogenization. Employing extensive characterization: TEM, NMR, DSC, XRD and FTIR, it is proposed that SLNs comprise of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) core into which KTZ is dissolved. PEG endows the lipid matrix with amorphousness and imperfections; rigidity; and, stability to aggregation, on storage and autoclaving. PEG is a simple, cost-effective and safe polymer with superior solubilizing and surfactant-supporting properties. Without its inclusion KTZ could not be loaded into SLNs. It ensured high incorporation efficiency (70%) of KTZ; small size (126 nm); and, better permeation into the eye. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated 2.5 and 1.6 fold higher bioavailability (AUC) in aqueous and vitreous humor, respectively.

As expected, survival for patients with lung metastases is even worse at about 5Â %. Early detection and staging are fundamental in improving survival rates and selecting the most effective treatment strategies. Recently, nanoparticles have been developed for imaging and treating various cancers, including pulmonary malignancies. In this work, three different examples of nanoparticle configurations for cancer theranosis are presented, namely conventional spherical polymeric nanoparticles with a diameter of ~150Â nm; and discoidal mesoporous silicon nanoconstructs and discoidal polymeric nanoconstructs with a diameter of ~1,000Â nm and a height of 400 and 500Â nm, respectively. The spherical nanoparticles accumulate in tumors by means of the well-known enhanced permeation and retention effect, whereas sub-micrometer discoidal nanoconstructs are rationally designed to adhere firmly to the tortuous tumor vasculature. All three nanoparticles are characterized for their in vivo performance in terms of magnetic resonance, positron-emission tomography (PET), and optical imaging. Preliminary data on the in vivo and ex vivo PET/CT imaging of breast cancer metastasis in the lungs using discoidal nanoconstructs is presented.

Worldwide, almost 280 million t of plastic materials are produced annually, much of which ends up in landfills or the oceans (Shaw and Sahni Journal of Mechanical and Civil Engineering 46-48, 2014). While plastics are lightweight, inexpensive, and durable, these same qualities can make them very harmful to wildlife, especially once they become waterborne. Once seaborne, plastics are most likely found circulating in one of five major ocean gyres: two in the Pacific, one in the Indian, and two in the Atlantic. These ocean garbage patches are not solid islands of plastic; instead, they are a turbid mix of plastics (Kostigen 2008; Livingeco 2011). Recent research conducted on the surfaces of the Great Lakes has identified similar problems (Erikson et al. Marine Pollution Bulletin, 77(1), 177-182, 2013). A growing concern is that once plastics reach the wild, they may cause entanglement, death from ingestion, and carry invasive species. Several cutting edge technologies have been piloted to monitor or gather the plastics already in our environments and convert them back into oil with hopes to reduce the damage plastics are causing to our ecosystems.

Cyclosporin A (CsA) would be a potent candidate for a causal therapy. However, CsA is not sufficiently water soluble to be administrated via simple eye drops. We developed an in situ nanosuspension (INS) as a novel approach towards the administration of CsA to the cornea. It precipitates upon contact with the tear fluid and creates CsA nanoparticles that enter the cornea and release the drug by dissolution. We selected two liquid poly(ethylene glycols) (PEG) that dissolve CsA and create nanoparticles by precipitation of CsA upon water contact. Aqueous solutions of PEG and Solutol, a non-ionic surfactant, were well tolerated by primary human epithelial cells in vitro. To determine the critical water content needed for a precipitation, the solubility of CsA was investigated in quaternary systems of drug, solvent, surfactant and water. The best INS formulation showed a particle size of 505 Â± 5 nm, a polydispersity index (PdI) of 0.23 Â± 0.03 and a neutral zeta potential of -0.07 Â± 0.05 mV.

In an effort to obtain a non-invasive approach of mapping intracellular O 2tensions, two methods of phosphorescent lifetime imaging microscopy were examined in the current study. These were picosecond time-resolved epiphosphorescence microscopy (single 0.5 m focused spot) and two-photon confocal laser scanning microscopy with pinhole shifting. Both methods utilized nanoparticle-embedded Ru complex (45 nm diameter) as the phosphorescent probe, excited using pulsed outputs of Ti-sapphire Tsunami lasers (710-1050 nm). The former method used a 1 ps pulse width excitation beam with vertical polarization via a dichroic mirror (610 nm, XF43) and a 20Ã—objective (NA 0.55, Nikon). Transmitted luminescence (1-2Ã—104counts s1) was collected and time-correlated single photon counted decay times measured. Alternatively, an unmodified Zeiss LSM510 Confocal NLO microscope with 40Ã—objective (NA 1.3) used successively shifted pinhole positions to collect image data from the lagging trail of the raster scan. Images obtained from two-photon excitation of a yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and a flagellate fish parasite (Spironucleus vortens), electroporated with Ru complex, indicated the intracellular location and magnitude of O2gradients, thus confirming the feasibility of optical mapping under different external O2concentrations. Both methods gave similar lifetimes for Ru complex phosphorescence under aerobic and anaerobic gas phases. Estimation of O 2tensions within individual fibroblasts (human dermal fibroblast (HDF)) and mammary adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells was possible using epiphosphorescence microscopy. MCF-7 cells showed lower intracellular O 2concentrations than HDF cells, possibly due to higher metabolic rates in the former. Future work should involve construction of higher resolution 3D maps of Ru coordinate complex lifetime distribution in cultured cell lines.

Monodisperse (30-nm) colloidal gold was prepared using a modified Frens method. A 200 mL solution of 0.01% tetrachloroauric acid in Milli-Q water was brought to boiling. 4mL sodium citrate solution (1% w/v) was added to the boiling gold chloride solution. The solution was allowed to boil for 10 min until it developed a typical bright wine-red color of colloidal gold. The average particles size of colloidal gold was determined using a TEM (Hitachi Model H-7500) operated at 120 kV. The average particle size was estimated to be approximately 30Â±4 nm. For the preparation of antibody gold conjugate, 90 Î¼g of antimorphine antibody was prepared in 20mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and added dropwise into 1mL colloidal gold solution ([Au]=2.4Ã—10-4 mol L-1) under mild stirring. The pH of the colloidal gold solution was maintained at 7.4 by addition of 10mM Na 2CO3 before adding antibody. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 Â°C and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 30 min to remove unconjugated antibody from the solution. The pellet obtained was washed three times with 10mM Tris (pH 8.0) containing 3% BSA under centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 30 min to remove traces of unconjugated antibody. The pellet was resuspended in 2mL of phosphate buffer (20mM, pH 7.4) and stored at 4 Â°C before use. The final concentration of colloidal gold in the antibody-gold conjugate solution was 4.8Ã—10-4 mol L-1. A Hitachi 2800 UV/vis spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorbance of gold nanoparticles and antibody-labeled gold nanoparticle Preparation of CNT suspension: To improve the carboxylic functional groups for better molecule attachment, 20 mg of aspurchased carboxylated CNT material was acid treated in 100 mL 3:1 volume ratio of concentrated H2SO4 and HNO 3 and refluxed overnight at 50 Â°C. The refluxed solution was centrifuged several times to separate the tubes from the acid solution and neutralize the solution until pH 6. To further enhance tube dispersity, the 1mgmL-1 treated solution was diluted 10 times with deionized water to 0.1 mg mL-1 concentration and 1 w/v% SDS was added into the final volume. The suspension was sonicated, followed by centrifugation for 1 h at 14000 rpm to remove the non-dispersed bundles. The extracted supernatant was kept as a stock solution for the entire experiment. Immunosensor preparation: The fabrication process of flexible CNT/PDMS LGFET is mentioned in the section 2 (Figure 1). In our earlier study on protein-CNT interaction,[27] carboxylated singlewalled CNTs were shown to interact better with BSA. Hence, the acid-treated carboxylated single-walled CNTs prepared using the above-mentioned treatment was used as the active channel of the LGFET. The carboxylic groups were first activated with EDC and sulfo-NHS for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed with 50mM PB solution (pH 9.5), followed by 10 Î¼gmL-1 MAM-BSA injection and overnight incubation at 4 Â°C. Excess unbound molecules were removed by rinsing the microchannel with copious PB solution, and the device was ready for target antibody detection. Electrical measurement: Electrical measurement of the CNTLGFET was performed using a homemade LabView system with a testing protocol similar to that in the reported literature.[16,28] For real-time monitoring, a liquid-gate potential (Vg) at -0.5 V was applied to the electrolyte through a reference electrode (3M KCl, FLEXREF, World Precision Instruments) and a small drain bias (Vd) of 10mV applied over the source and drain electrodes to obtain the kinetic response at respective sensing steps.

There is therefore increasing concern over the potential impacts of engineered nanoparticles in the environment on aquatic and terrestrial organisms and on human health. Once released into the environment, engineered nanoparticles will aggregate to some degree; they might also associate with suspended solids, sediment, be accumulated by organisms and enter drinking water sources and food materials. These fate processes are dependent on the characteristics of the particle and the characteristics of the environmental system. A range of ecotoxicological effects have also been reported, including effects on microbes, plants, invertebrates and fish. Although available data indicate that current risks of engineered nanoparticles in the environment to environmental and human health are probably low, our knowledge of the potential impacts of engineered nanoparticles in the environment on human health is still limited. There is therefore a need for continued work to develop an understanding of the exposure levels for engineered nanoparticles in environmental systems and to begin to explore the implications of these levels in terms of the ecosystem and human health. This will require research in a range of areas, including detection and characterization, environmental fate and transport, ecotoxicology and toxicology.

PNIPAM is a well-known thermo-responsive polymer with a volume phase transition temperature. This property allows it to be swollen in water at temperatures lower than 32-34Â°C to take up ZnPcS and shrunken to expel the drug at higher temperatures. Since the PL band of CdTe quantum dots (QDs) as indicators for the nanoparticles is at 585 nm and the emission band of ZnPcS is at 680 nm, it is possible to study the temperature-dependent release of ZnPcS from the nanoparticles by fluorescence measurements. ZnPcS was embedded in the PNIPAM of the nanoparticles at 25Â°C in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution and released at 37Â°C, measured with a spectrophotometer. When CHO cells had been incubated with the ZnPcS-loaded nanoparticles at 27Â°C, a similar intracellular localization pattern of CdTe QDs and ZnPcS was seen by multichannel measurements in confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), but a diffuse pattern of only ZnPcS fluorescence was detected in the cytoplasm of the cells at 37Â°C, indicating a release of ZnPcS from the nanoparticles. Similar results were also found in the intestinal tract of zebra fish in vivo after intake of the nanoparticles. Since the nanoparticles contain magnetic (Fe 3O4) material, the nanoparticles could also be manipulated to change their location in the intestinal tract of the zebra fish with an external magnetic field gradient of 300 G mm-1. The results presented suggest that such multifunctional nanoparticles may have combined potential for temperature-dependent drug delivery, QD photodetection and magnetic manipulation in diagnosis and therapy of diseases.

Intervention(s): ES cells were exposed to either 0 (control), 0.4, or 12.2 million/mL mixed-size fluorescent nanoparticles in culture (37Â°C, 5% CO2 in air) for 6 days. Main Outcome Measure(s): Cell viability and morphometric analysis were performed. Result(s): ES cells exposed to both concentrations of nanoparticles exhibited smaller cell surface area. The effect was not concentration dependent. In contrast, ES cell nucleus size was unaffected. The nanoparticles distributed into the cytoplasm, pseudopods, and the perinuclear region. ES cell viabilities were reduced 40% and 30% in the low versus high relative concentration, respectively. ES cells in low-concentration nanoparticles became mostly columnar and embryoid body shaped. However, in high-concentration nanoparticles, they differentiated toward fibroblast-like and less squamous types. Conclusion(s): The observed reduced ES cell surface area suggested disruption of cytoskeletal development but not nuclear organization by nanoparticles. The ring-like formation of nanoparticles around the nucleus and the resulting cell morphologies suggested nanoparticles may influence differentiation.

Superfine needle-like wollastonite powders are widely used as fillers in plastics, rubber and paints. However, because of limitations in processing technology, the interface compatibility between wollastonite filler powders and the polymer matrices in which they are used is often inadequate. Several common surface modification technologies, involving addition of either coupling-agents or surfactants followed by mechanical mixing, have been widely used to modify the surface properties of these powders, and these techniques are well developed. However, the sharp edges and the smooth cleavage surfaces formed during pulverizing cannot be modified using these methods. These intrinsic defects can provide nucleation sites for failure of composite polymer-based materials, and the existence of such defects therefore has a direct effect on the amount of the powder that can be filled into a given composite material. Technology for the nano-surface coating of needle-like wollastonite powders has been developed by Tsinghua University. The idea is to use a chemical reaction to deposit nano-sized particles of calcium carbonate on the surface of micron-sized particles of wollastonite. The composite particles formed by the depositing or coating not only possess the same dispersive properties as the original particles, but also possess outstanding characteristics due to the nano-particles on the surface. Characteristics of composite wollastonite powders were tested by using SEM, XRD, BET and so on. The composite particle is of rough surface and blunt edges and corners. The structure of nano-particles coating on surface of wollastonite has the same as that of calcite. The special surface area can be increased to four times the value before coating. Mechanical testing of polypropylene containing composite wollastonite powder as a filler show an increase in the impact strength of 65% compared to similar samples prepared using conventional filler powder.","Export Date: 13 June 2021 RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

A dose-dependent toxicity response by PS-NH(2)-90 and/or PS-NH(2)-200 on biomass and photosynthetic pigment (chlorophyll a) end-points of C. vulgaris was observed. Whereas varied concentrations of PS-NH(2)-300 had no significant toxic effect on biomass and chlorophyll a end-points compared to control groups (pÂ >Â 0.05). A comparison of toxicity of similar concentrations of PS-NH(2)-90, PS-NH(2)-200 and PS-NH(2)-300 showed small-sized PS-NH(2) were more toxic than large-sized PS-NH(2) (toxicity of PS-NH(2) increased in the order PS-NH(2)-300Â <Â PS-NH(2)-200Â <Â PS-NH(2)-90). With decreasing PS-NH(2) size, greater morphological changes and loss of original shape were observed, so that algal density/size reduced, and cell aggregations increased. Since PS-NH(2) have high affinity to C. vulgaris due to electrostatic interaction with polysaccharide wall of algae, this could be as the main reason for formation of large aggregates at high concentrations of PS-NH(2) compared to low concentrations of PS-NH(2) used in algae medium. At high concentrations, PS-NH(2) may act as intermediaries for connection of algal cells and therefore formation of aggregates. Field emission scanning electron microscopy images confirmed that high amounts of PS-NH(2)-90 were found to be embedded and adsorbed on algal cells, thereby limiting transfer of materials, gas exchange and energy between the aqueous medium and algal cells. These data may have serious ecological health implications, as C. vulgaris are important primary producers responsible for producing oxygen in aquatic environments."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",33964753,

Based on the induced loss of developing B cells observed in our in vitro studies, we speculate that in vivo, chronic PS microplastic-exposure may lead to suboptimal IgM/IgT levels in response to pathogens in teleost species. Considering the highly conserved nature of vertebrate B lymphopoiesis it is likely that PS microplastics will similarly reduce antibody responses in higher vertebrate species, including humans. Further, RAG1 provides an effective biomarker to determine effects of PS microplastics on B cell development in teleost species."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ?,ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",33930547,

Here we report the evaluation of its antiseizure activity in zebrafish and mouse epilepsy models to identify novel antiseizure compounds. The resin was extracted by solvents of increasing polarity. The hexane extract demonstrated the strongest antiseizure activity and was therefore subjected to bioactivity-guided isolation, which leaded to the isolation of eight terpene derivatives. A new prenylbicyclogermacrene derivative (2) was isolated along with seven other compounds (1, 3-8). Among them, the triterpene Î²-boswellic acid (5) showed the strongest activity and reduced 90% of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures at 100 Î¼g/mL. In parallel to B. sacra, a commercial extract of Boswellia serrata was also evaluated and showed moderate bioactivity (45% reduction at 30 Î¼g/mL). The extract of B. serrata was subjected to targeted isolation of other boswellic acid derivatives (9-13), which were evaluated for antiseizure activity in comparison with 5. In the whole series, Î²-boswellic acid (5) was the most active (60% reduction at 200 Î¼M), and its potency was also confirmed with its purchased standard (S5). Pure nanoparticles of S5 and a commercially formulated extract of B. serrata were tested in a PTZ-kindling mouse seizure model. This notably revealed that the S5 administration reduced seizures by 50% in this mouse model, which was consistent with its detection and quantification in plasma and brain samples. This study and the preclinical evaluation performed indicate that Î²-boswellic acid, common to various species of Boswellia, has some potential as an antiseizure agent."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention,1 - Type of study",33926190,

The extensive use of GNPs led researchers to investigate their toxicity, identifying stability, size, shape, and surface charge as key properties determining their impact on biological systems, with possible strategies defined to reduce it according to a Safe-by-Design (SbD) approach. The purpose of the present work was to analyze the toxicity of GNPs of various sizes and with different coating polymers on the developing vertebrate model, zebrafish. In particular, increasing concentrations (from 0.001 to 1 nM) of 6 or 15 nm poly-(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride)-graft-dodecyl polymer (PMA)- or polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated GNPs were tested on zebrafish embryos using the fish embryo test (FET). While GNP@PMA did not exert significant toxicity on zebrafish embryos, GNP@PEG induced a significant inhibition of embryo viability, a delay of hatching (with the smaller size NPs), and a higher incidence of malformations, in terms of tail morphology and eye development. Transmission electron microscope analysis evidenced that the more negatively charged GNP@PMA was sequestered by the positive charges of chorion proteins, with a consequent reduction in the amount of NPs able to reach the developing embryo and exert toxicological activity. The mild toxic response observed on embryos directly exposed to GNP@PMA suggest that these NPs are promising in terms of SbD development of gold-based biomedical nanodevices. On the other hand, the almost neutral GNP@PEG, which did not interact with the chorion surface and was free to cross chorion pores, significantly impacted the developing zebrafish. The present study raises concerns about the safety of PEGylated gold nanoparticles and contributes to the debated issue of the free use of this nanotool in medicine and nano-biotechnologies."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ?,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33919768,PMC8070688

The gradual dumping of plastic wastes, inadequate standard detection methods with specific removal techniques, and slow disposal rate of microplastics make it ubiquitous in the environment. Evidence shows that microplastics act as a potential vector by adsorbing different heavy metals, pathogens, and other chemical additives widely used in different raw plastic production. Microplastics are ingested by aquatic creatures such as fish and different crustaceans, and finally, people ingest them at the tertiary level of the food chain. This phenomenon is responsible for blocking the digestion tracts, disturbing the digestive behavior, finally decreasing the reproductive growth of entire living organisms.

To address this, we compile data from research documenting plastic debris ingestion by marine fish, totaling 171,774 individuals of 555 species. Overall, 386 marine fish species have ingested plastic debris including 210 species of commercial importance. However, 148 species studied had no records of plastic consumption, suggesting that while this evolutionary trap is widespread, it is not yet universal. Across all studies that accounted for microplastics, the incidence rate of plastic ingested by fish was 26%. Over the last decade this incidence has doubled, increasing by 2.4Â Â±Â 0.4%Â per year. This is driven both by increasing detection of smaller sized particles as a result of improved methodologies, as well as an increase in fish consuming plastic. Further, we investigated the role of geographic, ecological, and behavioral factors in the ingestion of plastic across species. These analyses revealed that the abundance of plastic in surface waters was positively correlated to plastic ingestion. Demersal species are more likely to ingest plastic in shallow waters; in contrast, pelagic species were most likely to consume plastic below the mixed layer. Mobile predatory species had the highest likelihood to ingest plastic; similarly, we found a positive relationship between trophic level and plastic ingestion. We also find evidence that surface ingestion-deep sea egestion of microplastics by mesopelagic myctophids is likely a key mechanism for the export of microplastics from the surface ocean to the seafloor, a sink for marine debris.

However, the effects of MPs on the olfactory ability of fish and the subsequent odorant evoked behaviors remain elusive. In the present study, we analyzed the potential olfactory toxicity of polystyrene (PS) MPs by assessing olfactory-driven behaviors of goldfish in response to odorants. Our results showed that the olfactory-driven behavioral responses of goldfish to L-cysteine and taurocholic acid were significantly hampered by a 28-day MP exposure. Further analysis demonstrated that exposure to MPs may suppress the expression of genes encoding olfactory G protein-coupled receptors, inhibit the enzyme activities of cation transport ATPases crucial for action potential generation, alter the in vivo contents of neurotransmitters as well as metabolites involved in the transduction of electrical signals, and cause olfactory bulb injury and neurotoxicity closely related to the processing of electrical signals. In conclusion, the results obtained in the present study suggest that MPs at environmentally relevant concentrations could impair the olfactory-mediated behavioral responses of goldfish, probably through hampering odorant identification, action potential generation, olfactory neural signal transduction, and olfactory information processing."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Maybe""}",33444954,

However, our understanding of the role of trophic niche in microplastic ingestion is still limited. Here, we quantified the level of microplastic (700 Î¼m to 5 mm) contamination for macroinvertebrates and fish within the Garonne river. We then used stable isotope analyses (Î´(13)C and Î´(15)N) to quantify trophic niches. We first demonstrated that the abundance of ingested microplastics differed between macroinvertebrates and fish and was not significantly related to microplastic pollution. We then found that microplastic characteristics (shape, color, size, and polymer composition) differ between the abiotic (surface waters and sediments) and biotic (ingested by macroinvertebrates and fish) compartments. The abundance of ingested microplastics increased with the size of organisms in both fish and macroinvertebrates and tended to increase with trophic position in macroinvertebrates only. Finally, the origin of the resources consumed by fish significantly affected the abundance of microplastics ingested. Altogether, these results suggest the absence of microplastic bioaccumulation in freshwater food webs and the dominance of direct consumption, most likely accidentally. The use of stable isotope analyses is therefore crucial to improve our understanding of microplastic ingestion by wild organisms."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33410676,

OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the levels of MP contamination in seafood and to subsequently estimate the annual human uptake. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched from launch (1947, 1974, and 1900, respectively) up to October 2020 for all studies reporting MP content in seafood species. Mean, standard deviations, and ranges of MPs found were collated. Studies were appraised systematically using a bespoke risk of bias (RoB) assessment tool. RESULTS: Fifty studies were included in the systematic review and 19 in the meta-analysis. Evidence was available on four phyla: mollusks, crustaceans, fish, and echinodermata. The majority of studies identified MP contamination in seafood and reported MP content Â <Â 1â€‰MP/g, with 26% of studies rated as having a high RoB, mainly due to analysis or reporting weaknesses. Mollusks collected off the coasts of Asia were the most heavily contaminated, coinciding with reported trends of MP contamination in the sea. According to the statistical summary, MP content was 0 -Â 10.5â€‰MPs/g in mollusks, 0.1 -Â 8.6â€‰MPs/g in crustaceans, 0 -Â 2.9â€‰MPs/g in fish, and 1â€‰MP/g in echinodermata. Maximum annual human MP uptake was estimated to be close to 55,000 MP particles. Statistical, sample, and methodological heterogeneity was high. DISCUSSION: This is the first systematic review, to our knowledge, to assess and quantify MP contamination of seafood and human uptake from its consumption, suggesting that action must be considered in order to reduce human exposure via such consumption. Further high-quality research using standardized methods is needed to cement the scientific evidence on MP contamination and human exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7171."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33355482,PMC7757379

Parenchymal hematoma triggers a series of reactions leading to primary and secondary brain injuries and permanent neurological deficits. Microglia and macrophages carry out hematoma clearance, thereby facilitating functional recovery after ICH. Here, we elucidate a pivotal role for the interleukin (IL)-4)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) axis in promoting long-term recovery in both blood- and collagenase-injection mouse models of ICH, through modulation of microglia/macrophage functions. In both ICH models, STAT6 was activated in microglia/macrophages (i.e., enhanced expression of phospho-STAT6 in Iba1(+) cells). Intranasal delivery of IL-4 nanoparticles after ICH hastened STAT6 activation and facilitated hematoma resolution. IL-4 treatment improved long-term functional recovery in young and aged male and young female mice. In contrast, STAT6 knockout (KO) mice exhibited worse outcomes than WT mice in both ICH models and were less responsive to IL-4 treatment. The construction of bone marrow chimera mice demonstrated that STAT6 KO in either the CNS or periphery exacerbated ICH outcomes. STAT6 KO impaired the capacity of phagocytes to engulf red blood cells in the ICH brain and in primary cultures. Transcriptional analyses identified lower level of IL-1 receptor-like 1 (ST2) expression in microglia/macrophages of STAT6 KO mice after ICH. ST2 KO diminished the beneficial effects of IL-4 after ICH. Collectively, these data confirm the importance of IL-4/STAT6/ST2 signaling in hematoma resolution and functional recovery after ICH.

In the design, the PS is externalized to the nanoparticles' surface only when the nanoparticles reach the MMP2-overexpressing tumor site, allowing for the TAM-specific phagocytosis. The nanoparticles' excellent macrophage/TAM selectivity was observed in various biological models, including various cell lines, coculture cells, coculture cell spheroids, zebrafish, and tumor-bearing mice. The nanoparticles' TAM specificity remarkably enhanced the TAM depletion capability of the loaded model drug, dasatinib, resulting in the improved anticancer activity. The MMP2-sensitive apoptotic body-mimicking nanoparticles might be a promising delivery tool for TAM-centered cancer diagnoses and treatments."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention,1 - Type of study",33169982,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unilateral selective renal embolization of a segmental artery was performed in 16 New Zealand White rabbits with PDO-MS (100-150 Î¼m and 90-315 Î¼m). Animals were randomly assigned to different observation periods and underwent control digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and MR imaging immediately (nÂ = 3), 1 week (nÂ = 2), 4 weeks (nÂ = 2), 8 weeks (nÂ = 2), 12 weeks (nÂ = 5), and 16 weeks (nÂ = 2) after embolization. Kidneys were harvested for macroscopic and histologic analysis of embolization success, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. RESULTS: Embolization was technically successful in 15 of 16 animals. One animal died of anesthesia-related circulatory failure. The 100-150 Î¼m MS were injected easily through 3-F catheters; the 90-315 Î¼m MS tended to clog with intermittent catheter obstruction. DSA and MR imaging showed successful target embolization in 13 of 15 animals. In 2 animals, the entire kidney was affected owing to catheter clogging, including a reflux of MS while flushing. Control DSA and MR imaging showed increasing vascular reperfusion with time. Macroscopic and histologic analysis revealed necrosis/infarction in areas in which embolization was achieved. MS were extensively degraded after 16 weeks, and overall inflammatory reaction was mild. CONCLUSIONS: Biodegradable PDO-MS induced effective embolization of target vessels while demonstrating good biocompatibility. MS increasingly dissolved at 16 weeks, partial reperfusion started at week 1, and complete reperfusion started at week 8, thus offering possible advantages as a temporary embolic agent."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",33160828,

Fish were exposed to 0.009Â mg-MPs (approximately 1000 particles)/L to 0.32Â mg-MPs (approximately 40,000 particles)/L for 12 weeks. The eyes and kidneys were evaluated by histopathologic analysis.

The number of spawned eggs decreased, and changes were noted in the eyes of fish exposed to â‰¥0.032Â mg-MPs/L under breeding conditions. The eyes exhibited thinning of the optic nerve fiber layer and dilatation of retinal capillaries compared with medaka not treated with MPs. Changes in the kidneys were observed in fish exposed to â‰¥0.065Â mg-MPs/L. The mesangial matrix in the glomerulus of the kidneys was expanded compared with non-treated medaka, suggesting a deterioration in renal function. Analyses of an oxidative stress marker in the tissues indicated that lesion progression was associated with increased oxidative stress. Furthermore, a comparison of adverse effect levels suggested that MPs were more toxic to the eyes and reproduction than the kidneys or growth. Our data should prove useful for determining the LOAELs of polyethylene beads on vertebrates and enhance understanding of the mechanism underlying the biological toxicity of polyethylene MPs."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Maybe""}",33158613,

The hypothesis that the acute exposure (five days) to polylactic acid (PLA) biopolymers may lead to behavioral and biochemical changes and to their accumulation in Danio rerio larvae was tested. Based on the results, PLA biomicroplastics (PLA BioMPs) at concentration of 3 and 9Â mg/L decreased swimming distance and speed of larvae in the open field test. This outcome suggests effects on animals' locomotor and exploration activities. Larvae's longer immobility time and greater permanence in the peripheral zone of the apparatus is indicative of anxiety-like behavior caused by the exposure to PLA BioMPs. Zebrafish larvae accumulated PLA BioMPs and their acetylcholinesterase activity was inhibited by their presence, which reinforces the accumulative potential of biopolymers and their direct or indirect role as anxiogenic agents, even at sublethal concentrations. The decreased activity of acetylcholinesterase reinforces the neurotoxic action in groups exposed to PLA BioMPs. The current study has confirmed the initial hypothesis and is an insight about the toxicity of these biopolymers in D. rerio larvae, since it deepens the discussion about the environmental risk of these substances in freshwater ecosystems."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Maybe""}",33068943,

Unfortunately, the interaction of TNP with cells impaired the host defenses of fish resulting in increased mortality during bacterial challenges. The present study evaluated the efficacy of the ethanolic extract of Tinospora cordifolia (TCE) as a dietary supplement in ameliorating TNP induced toxicity in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The fishes were exposed to environmentally relevant concentration (10Â mg/L) of TNP for 14Â days and the effect of TCE supplemented feed at 3 different doses (5, 10, and 15Â g/kg) was studied. TCE signally increased the weight gain, specific growth rate, and decreased feed conversion ratio in fish. TCE significantly (PÂ <Â 0.05) ameliorated the toxic effects caused by TNP by increasing the antioxidant (CAT, SOD, GPx) activity and decreasing the levels of serum enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, ACP), macromolecular oxidation, excessive ROS production, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1Î², IL-6, IL-8, INF-Î³, TNF-Î±, PGE-2). TNP bioaccumulation and histopathological alterations in gill, liver, and kidney were also significantly alleviated by TCE supplementation. TCE perceptibly regulated the expression of heat shock proteins (HSP60, -70), MAPKs (pERK1/2, pp38), antioxidant (NRF2, Keap1, HO-1), apoptotic (p53, PDRG1), and anti-apoptotic (AKT, Bcl2) proteins in fish. Regarding disease resistance, the TCE co-treated groups showed reduced cumulative mortality and higher relative percent survival with A. hydrophila.

Among them, mussel shells could provide a calcium-rich source for the synthesis of hydroxyapatite (HA) bioceramics. In this work, HA nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized starting from mussel shells (Mytilus edulis) with a two steps process based on thermal treatment to convert CaCO(3) in CaO and subsequent wet precipitation with a phosphorus source. Several parameters were studied, such as the temperature and gaseous atmosphere of the thermal treatment as well as the use of two different phosphorus-containing reagents in the wet precipitation. Data have revealed that the characteristics of the powders can be tailored, changing the conditions of the process. In particular, the use of (NH(4))(2)HPO(4) as the phosphorus source led to HA nanoparticles with a high crystallinity degree, while smaller nanoparticles with a higher surface area were obtained when H(3)PO(4) was employed. Further, a selected HA sample was synthesized at the pilot scale; then, it was employed to fabricate porous 3D scaffolds using the direct foaming method. A highly porous scaffold with open and interconnected porosity associated with good mechanical properties (i.e., porosity in the range 87-89%, pore size in the range 50-300 Î¼m, and a compressive strength Ïƒ = 0.51 Â± 0.14 MPa) suitable for bone replacement was achieved.

The goal of this research was to explore the microplastic pollution problem in the Beijiang River and Pearl River Delta. In total, 26 surface water and 47 wild freshwater fish samples from the Pearl River Delta and the main runoff area of the Beijiang River were collected. The average abundance of microplastics in surface water samples from the Beijiang River was 3183 items/mÂ³, and the average abundance in fish samples was 5.6 items/individual; the values for the Pearl River Delta were 7571 items/mÂ³ and 4.8 items/individual. In all samples, fibers and fragments were the major microplastic contaminants, most were white in color, and most were <1Â mm in size. The microplastic abundance in carnivorous fish samples in the Beijiang River and Pearl River Delta was 3.5 and 3 items/individual, respectively, and omnivorous fish samples had 6.8 and 6.2 items/individual, respectively. Thus, the microplastic abundance in omnivorous fish samples was about twice that of the carnivorous fish.

Our results showed the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was the dominant microplastic accumulation site in zebrafish, followed by the gill, whereas no microplastics were detected in the brain or muscle.

However, the thickness of muscularis layer in the foregut reduced by 32% after 1 mg/L (1.45 Ã— 10(4) particles/mL) microplastic exposure. As there were no signs of oxidative stress or other histological changes found in the fish, we further investigated the energy-supplying influential factors. We found that the zebrafish became hyperactive after microplastic exposure, whose swimming distance had increased to 1.3-2.4 folds than that of control, and also stayed at manic and active states much longer. The fish behavioural alteration is probably attributed to the particulate matter stimulation and the up-regulation of estrogen contents. Results also showed that the excessive movements of zebrafish also led to decreased glucose and acetaldehyde metabolite contents and increased amino acid amounts, which further proved the shortage of energy-supplying substances. Therefore, the present study suggests that micro-sized microplastics can induce obvious behavioural abnormality at concentrations that some other toxicological endpoints may not warn effects."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Maybe""}",32504859,

The abundances of microplastics were 0.4-20.5 items/L in surface water, 44.4-124.7 items/kg (ww) in sediment and 1.9-6.1 items/individual in guts of Hemiculter leucisculus from the industrial area.

A large quantity of raw pellets were found on the grounds surrounding the plastic factories. The dominant shapes of microplastics found in sediment were fragments (67%), followed by pellets (18%). Unexpectedly, neither fragments nor pellets (> 1Â mm) were found in any fish. The organ index of liver in Hemiculter leucisculus, including four types of histopathological changes, was up to 5.5-9.9 in the plastic production area and only 1.6 in the reference site. Our results strongly suggest that microplastic pollution was in high level, and the histopathological damage in fish tissues strongly confirmed the microplastic pollution and ecological response of the plastic production area.

A full-factorial experimental breeding design allowed us to estimate the relative contributions of male (sire) and female (dam) parents and full-sib family variance in early feeding traits, and also genetic (co)variation between these traits. We also monitored the magnitude of intake and elimination of microplastics from the alimentary tracts of the larvae. In general, larval whitefish ingested small numbers of microplastics (meanÂ =Â 1.8, rangeÂ =Â 0-26 particles per larva), but ingestion was marginally affected by the dam, and more strongly by the full-sib family variation. Microsphere ingestion showed no statistically significant additive genetic variation, and thus, no heritability. Moreover, microsphere ingestion rate covaried positively with the ingestion of Artemia, further suggesting that larvae cannot adaptively avoid microsphere ingestion. Together with the detected strong genetic correlation between food intake and microplastic intake, the results suggest that larval fish do not readily possess additive genetic variation that would help them to adapt to the increasing pollution by microplastics.

Additionally, to determine and compare the relative MP levels in edible versus non-edible tissues, and consider the wider implications in terms of human health concerns with a preliminary risk identification approach. For several fish species, samples taken from typically non-edible (gills, digestive system) and edible (muscle) flesh, and were analysed separately. Scallops, where all tissues are edible, were analysed whole. Significant differences were observed in the number of particles isolated from the finfish gills and digestive tissues relative to the control samples, but not in the edible flesh. For scallops, the abundance of particles in the Scottish samples did not vary significantly from the control, while the Patagonian scallops displayed significantly higher numbers of MPs. Characterisation of MPs by FTIR microscopy found that 16-60% (depending on species) were polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene (PE) in origin. The risk identification results validate MPs as an emerging risk in the food chain and establish seafood as a vector for the exposure and uptake of MPs through the ingestion route for humans. Levels of MPs in seafood, and a direct link to the human food chain, suggests that their quantification be included as one food safety measure."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32302891,

Nodavirus is an important threat in the aquaculture industry, causing severe economic losses and environmental problems. The LFB was based on polyclonal antibodies conjugated on gold nanoparticles for signal visualization. Brain and retinas from fish samples were homogenized, centrifuged and the supernatant was directly applied on the LFB. Formation of a red test line was indicative of nodavirus virions presence. Nodavirus visual detection was completed in short time (30â€‰min). Key factors of the LFB development influencing the assays' detection limit were characterized and the optimum parameters were determined, enabling increased efficiency, excluding non-specific interactions. Therefore, the proposed LFB assay consists a robust, simple, low cost and accurate method for detection of nodavirus virions in fish samples. The proposed biosensor is ideal for development of a commercial kit to be used on aquaculture facilities by fish farmers.

The chikungunya is an arbovirus, in many cases, increased, which is transmitted by the same transmitter dengue vector, Aedes aegypti. The symptoms of both diseases are similar, and infections can be lethal. Although there is no preventive vaccine against any of the two diseases, therefore, it is extremely important to control the mosquito. The eggs of A. aegypti are very resistant and hatch into larvae, which later give rise to mosquitoes in any container with water. Natural plant extracts have come from active substances with larvicidal activity against A. aegypti. However, they tend to be highly hydrophobic and need some strategy to improve its affinity for water. Because of these factors, this research aims to synthesize and characterize polymeric materials with properties suitable for the release of hydrophobic principles with larvicidal action. The synthesized polymers are poly (butylene succinate) (PBS) and PBS block copolymer with polyethylene glycol (PEG). The synthesized polymers were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, thermal analysis simultaneous, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and diffraction of X-rays analysis. The analysis results showed that the synthesized materials have chemical composition and properties suitable for use in the controlled release of actives substances. Systems were prepared using the Dendranthema grandiflora extract, which has larvicidal activity was incorporated via fusion to polymers, to evaluate its release in aqueous media. The results proved that higher amounts of PEG in the copolymer chain speed up the delivery of the larvicidal extract. Besides that, the larvicidal extract concentration required to cause death larvae of A. aegypti was achieved from the first minutes of dissolution tests, indicating that the materials developed are promising tool to fight dengue and chikungunya.

The covering layer of PS particles on the outer surface of chorions affected the patency of pores in chorions, and the nano- PS particles exerted a considerable effect. The accelerated heart rate and blood flow velocity in the embryos indicated that the PS particles adhering to embryonic chorions might cause an internal hypoxic microenvironment in the embryos.

C. gariepinus is a fresh water indicator species often used as model for ecotoxicological assay. Fish specimens were exposed to diets spiked with PVC microparticles (95.41Â Â±Â 4.23Â Î¼m) at the following concentrations; 0.50%, 1.50% and 3.0% and control diet for 45Â days, followed by a depuration trial which lasted for 30Â days. Blood and tissues (brain and gill) were sampled every 15Â days interval for haematology, antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation assay. The result obtained revealed that PVC orchestrated the marked alterations in haematological indices. Mean cell volume and mean cell haemoglobin values reduced significantly in all concentration treated groups and were time-dependent. Neutrophil counts decreased with a corresponding increase in PVC exposure time while lymphocytes and monocytes values showed no significant difference between the control and exposed fish groups. Glutathione peroxidase activity was altered substantially in the brain and gill of the exposed groups compared to the control. Superoxide dismutase activity was inhibited in the brain and gill of the exposed groups compared to the control, as well as the different exposed periods. Catalase activity reduced significantly in the brain of 0.5% PVC exposed groups, and also decreased in a time-dependent manner while its activity in the gill did not change significantly among the exposed groups relative to the control. Lipid peroxidation levels in the brain of PVC exposed groups increased significantly in a dose and time-dependent manner. However, PVC caused no significantly change in the gill lipid peroxidation level of the exposed fish, but elevated the lipid peroxidation levels as the exposure time increased. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain and gill of the exposed fish reduced substantially with increase in the exposure time. Variations in haematology, antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxidation and acetylcholinesterase activities are indicative of oxidative stress and neurotoxicity in fish.

A number of active and passive pathways have been suggested for fish, including the confusion of microplastic particles with prey, accidental uptake while foraging and transfer through the food chain, but a holistic understanding of influencing factors is still lacking. The aim of the study was to investigate frequently suggested theories and identify relevant biotic factors, as well as certain plastic properties, affecting microplastic intake in fish. Four species of freshwater fish, each representing a different combination of foraging style (visual/chemosensory) and domestic status (wild/farmed) were exposed to different realistic plastic concentrations and polymer types with and without the provision of genuine food. As most previous investigations of microplastic uptake routes consider only particles large enough to be perceptible to fish, the potential for accidental intake via drinking water has been somewhat neglected. This route is evaluated in the current study using a model approach. The results show that visually oriented fish forage actively on microplastic particles that optically resemble their usual food, while fish with a predominantly chemosensory foraging style are more able to discriminate inedible food items. Even so, the accidental uptake of microplastics while foraging is shown to be relevant pathway, occurring frequently in both visual and chemosensory foragers alike. Several factors were shown to increase plastic uptake, including microplastic concentration in the water, foraging behaviour promoted by availability of genuine food, and fish size. Although both wild and farmed fish ingested microplastic particles, cultured fish showed less discernment in terms of colour and were more likely to forage actively on microplastics when no food was available. Drinking has been identified as a possible source of microplastic intake specifically for large marine fish species. Particles smaller than <5â€‰Âµm can pass the gastrointestinal tract wall and bioaccumulation could arise when uptake exceeds release or when particles are assimilated in tissues or organs. The effects of accumulation may be significant, especially in long-living species, with implications for food web transfer and fish as food items."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Maybe""}",32127589,PMC7054251

Toxicological studies require the use of inert materials and controlled conditions. Yet, none of the available commercialized systems is adequate to assess the toxic effect of microplastics, because they contain components made of plastic polymers that may release micrometric plastic particles, leach manufacturing compounds, or adsorb chemicals.

The results showed that the dominant contaminants (polypropylene fibers and polyethylene fibers) might originate from the abrasion of fishing gear and contributed to 61.6% of the total abundance of microplastics in surface sediment. The abundance of polypropylene fibers and polyethylene fibers exhibited a strong correlation (R(2) = 0.8586, p = 0.015) with values of fishery yields of different districts, which highlighted the effects of different fishery activities on microplastic contamination in marine sediment. Microplastics could be ""hidden"" in deep sediment to a depth of 60 cm. The estimated storage of microplastics in deep sediment (185 tons) was 5 times that in surface sediment. The assessment of microplastic storage worldwide might be underestimated because most previous studies only examined surface sediment.

The risk of harmful interactions with marine plastic pollution depends on the biology of the species as well as the distribution and abundance of the different plastic types. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of plastic ingestion by the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula), one of the most abundant elasmobranchs in the Mediterranean Sea. The expression levels of genes indicative of total immune system function were analyzed to gather preliminary data for further investigation of any potential correlations between plastic presence and immune activation. One hundred catsharks were collected during the Spring 2018 in two geographic locations in the southern region of the central Mediterranean Sea: 1) near Mazara del Vallo, SW Sicily and 2) near Lampedusa island, Italy's southernmost. Standard measurements were recorded for each specimen and its organs and sex was determined. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was preserved for plastic detection and identification. Where present, plastics (macro- and micro-) were characterized in terms of size, shape and polymer typology through microscopy and Î¼-Raman spectroscopy. Spleen from a subset of thirty samples was preserved for RNA extraction, then used to quantify by real time PCR the transcripts of T cell receptor beta (TCRB), T cell receptor delta (TCRD) and IgM genes. The results indicated that ingestion of plastic is widespread, with microplastics (MP, from 1Â Î¼m to <1Â mm) abundantly present in nearly all samples and macroplasticplastic (MaP, > 1Â cm) in approximately 18% of the specimens collected. A significant increase in the expression of TCRB, TCRD and IgM was observed in the spleen of MaPÂ +Â specimens from Mazara del Vallo waters, in parallel with 67% increase in liver weight. While the presence of MP alone is not enough to induce a strong activation of the immunity, some type of plastics falling into the MaP category may be more toxic than others and crucial in the activation of the immune response. The results of this study represent a first evidence that plastic pollution represents an emerging threat to S. canicula, the Mediterranean food web and human consumers."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ?,ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31965976,

It is found commonly in human and animal diets and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a flavoring agent. Nevertheless, recent studies have suggested that nerolidol has potent hepatotoxic effects. Because use of plant-based products in human and animal food has expanded considerably, it is essential to develop approaches such as nanotechnology to avoid or reduce hepatic toxic effects. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine whether nerolidol dietary supplementation elicited hepatic damage associated with impairment of energy homeostasis, as well as whether supplementation with nerolidol-loaded in nanospheres prevented hepatotoxic effects in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Nile tilapia were divided into five groups (A-E, nâ€‰=â€‰10 per group) with four replicates each, as follows: group A received basal feed (without supplementation); group B received feed containing 0.5Â mL free nerolidol/kg; group C received feed containing 1.0Â mL free nerolidol/kg; group D received feed containing 0.5Â mL nanospheres nerolidol/kg; and group E received feed containing 1.0Â mL nanospheres nerolidol/kg. All groups received experimental feed once a day (10% total biomass) at 2Â p.m. for 60 consecutive days. Hepatic liver weight and relative liver weight were significantly lower in fish fed 1.0Â mL free nerolidol/kg feed than in fish given basal diet (control group). Hepatic pyruvate kinase (1.0Â mL free nerolidol/kg) and adenylate kinase (0.5 and 1.0Â mL free nerolidol/kg) activities were significantly lower than in the control group, while hepatic reactive oxygen species and lipid damage levels were significantly higher. Finally, the comet assay revealed significant increases in the frequency of damage and the damage index in fish given 0.5 and 1.0Â mL free nerolidol/kg in a dose-dependent manner. Nerolidol-loaded in nanospheres prevented all alterations elicited by free nerolidol. Based on these data, we concluded that dietary supplementation with free nerolidol elicited severe impairment of hepatic bioenergetics homeostasis that appeared to be mediated by excessive ROS production and lipid damage, contributing to a genotoxic effect. Dietary supplementation with nerolidol-loaded in nanospheres did not elicit hepatic damage, and therefore, should be considered as a replacement so as to limit toxicity, permitting its continued use as a dietary supplement."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31953674,

Here we assessed individual-level ingestion of Polyethylene microspheres by laboratory-reared juvenile anemonefish, Amphiprion ocellaris, in relation to (a) ambient particle concentrations and (b) repeatable behavioural traits. We show that microplastic ingestion is highly variable at all tested particle concentrations and that this variation can partially be explained by individual activity levels. Moreover, the relationship between ingestion and behavioural variation increased notably when only the most behaviourally consistent individuals (nÂ =Â 40 out of 60) were considered in the analysis. Our findings indicate that microplastic ingestion rates in juvenile reef fishes may be less dependent on ambient concentrations than expected; instead they are to some degree phenotype-dependent. Care should thus be taken when reporting mean responses to microplastic exposure treatments, because some individuals may not be affected in the same way as others due to differential ingestion behaviour.

However, while the number of studies documentating the ingestion of microplastics by fish has increased, fewer studies have addressed the toxicological effects derived from the ingestion of these small items in wild conditions. Here, MP contamination and effect biomarkers were investigated in three commercially important fish species from the North East Atlantic Ocean. From the 150 analysed fish (50 per species), 49 % had MP. In fish from the 3 species, MP in the gastrointestinal tract, gills and dorsal muscle were found. Fish with MP had significantly (pÂ â‰¤Â 0.05) higher lipid peroxidation levels in the brain, gills and dorsal muscle, and increased brain acetylcholinesterase activity than fish where no MP were found. These results suggest lipid oxidative damage in gills and muscle, and neurotoxicity through lipid oxidative damage and acetylcholinesterase induction in relation to MP and/or MP-associated chemicals exposure. From the 150 fish analysed, 32 % had MP in dorsal muscle, with a total mean (Â± SD) of 0.054Â Â±Â 0.099 MP items/g. Based on this mean and on EFSA recommendation for fish consumption by adults or the general population, human consumers of Dicentrachus labrax, Trachurus trachurus, Scomber colias may intake 842 MP items/year from fish consumption only. Based on the mean of MP in fish muscle and data (EUMOFA, NOAA) of fish consumption per capita in selected European and American countries, the estimated intake of microplastics through fish consumption ranged from 518 to 3078 MP items/year/capita. Considering that fish consumption is only one of the routes of human exposure to microplastics, this study and others in the literature emphasize the need for more research, risk assessment and adoption of measures to minimize human exposure to these particles.

Of these particles, the ingestion of microplastics (MPs; particles smaller than 5â€¯mm) have been documented in some aquatic animals, including fish, whose health and welfare suffer as a consequence. However, their precise effects are not completely understood. To shed light on this issue, European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) specimens were fed diets containing 0 (control), 100 or 500â€¯mg polyvinylchloride (PVC) or polyethylene (PE) MPs kg(-1) diet for three weeks, after which samples of liver, intestine, skin mucus and head kidney (HK) were obtained. A histological study of the liver and intestine revealed important alterations in the fish fed the MP diets, compared with control fish. At a functional level, PE-MPs, but not PVC-MPs, decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, suggesting a certain level of oxidative stress. As regards immunity, the intake of PVC-MPs increased the phagocytic and respiratory burst activities of HK leucocytes whilst the intake of PE-MPs increased skin mucus immunoglobulin M levels and the respiratory burst activity of leucocytes. The results suggest that the short-medium term intake of PVC- or PE-MPs by fish slightly depresses their immunity and produces oxidative stress. However, based on the histological alterations found, it seems that longer exposure times might lead to irreversible damage that could compromise fish health and welfare."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Maybe""}",31683003,

In this study, MPs were investigated in two economically and ecologically key crustaceans of the Mediterranean Sea, the Norwegian lobster Nephrops norvegicus and the shrimp Aristeus antennatus. Both the species were collected from 14 sites around Sardinia Island, at depths comprised between 270 and 660â€¯m. A total of 89 and 63 stomachs were analysed for N.Â norvegicus and A.Â antennatus respectively, and more than 2000â€¯MPs-like particles were extracted and sorted for identification and characterization by Î¼FT-IR. In N.Â norvegicus, 83% of the specimens contained MPs, with an average abundance of 5.5â€¯Â±â€¯0.8â€¯MPs individual(-1), while A.Â antennatus showed a lower frequency of ingestion (67%) and a lower mean number of MPs (1.66â€¯Â±â€¯0.1â€¯MPs individual(-1)). Composition and size of particles differed significantly between the two species. The non-selective feeding strategy of N.Â norvegicus could explain the 3-5 folds higher numbers of MPs in its stomach, which were mostly composed of films and fragments derived by polyethylene and polypropylene single-use plastic items. Contrarily, most MPs in the stomachs of A.Â antennatus were polyester filaments. The MPs abundance observed in N.Â norvegicus is among the highest detected in Mediterranean species considering both fish and invertebrates species, and provides novel insights on MPs bioavailability in deep-sea habitats. The overall results suggest that both N.Â norvegicus and A.Â antennatus, easily available in common fishery markets, could be valuable bioindicators and flagship species for plastic contamination in the deep-sea."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31671310,

Even though those differences hamper comparisons between some studies, a comparative work has been performed to identify the factors influencing MP ingestion by fish and consequently to target potential ecological traits that can be used to monitor species. Monitoring plastic ingested by fish will give relevant ecological information on MP pollution. This review focuses on MP ingestion by wild freshwater and estuarine fish. In addition to providing an overview of the existing data concerning contamination levels in wild freshwater fish, we aimed to (1) propose several overall recommendations on the methodologies applicable to all biota, (2) compare MP contamination levels in fish and in their environment, and (3) determine which parameters could help to define fish species for monitoring."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31664835,

In this work, an optical conveyor belt assembled from natural biological cells is proposed. The diameter of the belt (500 nm) is smaller than the laser wavelength (980 nm) and, therefore, the evanescent wave stably traps the nanoparticles and cells on the belt surface. By adjusting the relative power of the lasers injected into the belt, the particles or cells can be bidirectionally transported along the bio-conveyor belt. The experimental results are numerically interpreted and the transport velocities are investigated based on simulations. Further experiments show that the bio-conveyor belt can also be assembled with mammalian cells and then applied to dynamic cell transport in vivo.

The most important parasites affecting the CNS are protozoans (Plasmodium sp., Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma brucei), cestodes (Taenia solium) and free-living amoebae (Acantamoeba spp., Balamuthia mandrillaris and Naegleria fowleri). Current therapeutic regimens include the use of traditional chemicals or natural compounds that have very limited access to the CNS, despite their elevated toxicity to the host. Improvements are needed in drug administration and formulations to treat these infections and to allow the drug to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). METHODS: This work aims to elucidate the recent advancements in the use of nanoparticles as nanoscaled drug delivery systems (NDDS) for treating and controlling the parasitic infections that affect the CNS, addressing not only the nature and composition of the polymer chosen, but also the mechanisms by which these nanoparticles may cross the BBB and reach the infected tissue. RESULTS: There is a strong evidence in the literature demonstrating the potential usefulness of polymeric nanoparticles as functional carriers of drugs to the CNS. Some of them demonstrated the mechanisms by which drugloaded nanoparticles access the CNS and control the infection by using in vivo models, while others only describe the pharmacological ability of these particles to be utilized in in vitro environments. CONCLUSION: The scarcity of the studies trying to elucidate the compatibility as well as the exact mechanisms by which NDDS might be entering the CNS infected by parasites reveals new possibilities for further exploratory projects. There is an urgent need for new investments and motivations for applying nanotechnology to control parasitic infectious diseases worldwide."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: !,QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31612822,

The shrimps ingested fibers and beads along with the food. Upon ingestion, the beads and the shortest fibers (up to 100â€¯Î¼m) passed from the stomach into the gut and were egested within the fecal strings. The longer fibers first remained in the stomach but were regurgitated, i.e. extruded through the esophagus, within 12-14â€¯h. Regurgitation is an evolutionary adaptation of particular crustacean species and other invertebrates to remove large and indigestible food particles from the stomach. Accordingly, the process of regurgitation attained a new task nowadays, i.e. the elimination of anthropogenic filamentous microplastic debris from the stomach to avoid harm.

Conventional wound dressings were ineffective in preventing stricture because of poor stability of underwater-adhesives on living tissues. Here, we present a microparticle-based wound dressing with underwater adhesive stability for the treatment of gastrointestinal tract wound healing after ESD. Monodisperse microparticles composed of hydrophobically-modified Alaska pollock gelatin were prepared by self-assembly of gelatin in water-ethanol mixed solvents and thermal crosslinking. Hydrophobic modification of gelatin with aliphatic aldehydes increased adhesion strength to gastric and esophageal submucosal tissues through hydrophobic interaction with living tissues and cohesion force. Optimal hydrophobic modification drastically improved underwater stability of microparticles compared to that of non-modified gelatin and formed a thick, integrated hydrogel layer on tissues. Histological observation of rat skin wound healing models showed that hydrophobically-modified gelatin microparticles decreased the expression levels of Î±-smooth muscle actin in the dermis layer and could suppress fibrosis and inflammation after ESD. The microparticle wound dressing with high underwater-adhesive stability has enormous therapeutic potential to promote wound healing in the gastrointestinal tract and prevent additional symptoms after ESD. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The goal of this study was to develop wound dressing with strong tissue-adhesive property to living tissues for promoting wound healing after ESD treatment.

Hydrophobic modification of gelatin with aliphatic aldehydes enhanced adhesion strength to gastric and esophageal submucosal tissues through hydrophobic interaction with living tissues and cohesion force.

AgNO(3) had low significant adverse effects on some parameters in comparison with those impacts of AgNPs. The concentrations of creatinine and uric acid exhibited different significant variations under stress in all exposed groups compared with those in the control group.

Interestingly, HERV-K positive EVs concentrations were significantly associated with a reduced expression of IL1-Î² and mpx, supporting our hypothesis that HERV-positive EVs may act as immunomodulators in tumor progression.

Today it has become clear that plastic causes adverse effects in all ecosystems and that microplastics are of particular concern to our health. Therefore, recent microbial research has addressed the question of if and to what extent microorganisms can degrade plastics in the environment. This review summarizes current knowledge on microbial plastic degradation. Enzymes available act mainly on the high-molecular-weight polymers of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and ester-based polyurethane (PUR). Unfortunately, the best PUR- and PET-active enzymes and microorganisms known still have moderate turnover rates. While many reports describing microbial communities degrading chemical additives have been published, no enzymes acting on the high-molecular-weight polymers polystyrene, polyamide, polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, ether-based polyurethane, and polyethylene are known. Together, these polymers comprise more than 80% of annual plastic production. Thus, further research is needed to significantly increase the diversity of enzymes and microorganisms acting on these polymers. This can be achieved by tapping into the global metagenomes of noncultivated microorganisms and dark matter proteins. Only then can novel biocatalysts and organisms be delivered that allow rapid degradation, recycling, or value-added use of the vast majority of most human-made polymers."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31324632,PMC6752018

To partially address this issue, the present study investigated biofilm formation by microorganisms originating from lake water on low-density polyethylene (LDPE) MPs using a cultivation approach and the surface-related effects on the MP-associated microbial communities using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. With the addition of nonionic surfactants and UV-irradiation pretreatment that changed the surface properties of LDPE MPs, more microorganisms were colonized on LDPE surface. Microbial community analysis indicated that LDPE MPs were primarily colonized by the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and the surface roughness and hydrophobicity of MP were important factors shaping the LDPE MP-associated microbial community structure. Half of the top 20 most abundant genera colonizing on LDPE were found to be potential pathogens, e.g., plant pathogens Agrobacterium, nosocomial pathogens Chryseobacterium and fish pathogens Flavobacterium. This study demonstrated rapid bacterial colonization of LDPE MPs in lake water microcosms, the role of MPs as transfer vectors for harmful microorganisms in lake water, and provided a first glimpse into the effect of surface properties on LDPE MP-associated biofilm communities."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",31146243,

Fibrous MPs (microfibres) are often reported as the most commonly encountered shape of particle. To estimate MP concentrations in seawater, samples are often collected using towed nets (generally 300-350-Î¼m mesh) and may underestimate the amount of microfibres present, which may pass through the mesh due to their narrow width. We compared the potential microplastic particle (PMP) concentration estimates provided by two different seawater sampling methods conducted at three commercial shellfish farms and three unfarmed sites in Baynes Sound, British Columbia, Canada. The methods were: 10-L bucket samples sieved through 63-Î¼m mesh in situ and subsequently filtered through an 8-Î¼m polycarbonate membrane; and 1-L bulk samples collected in jars and subsequently filtered to 8â€¯Î¼m. The jar samples yielded PMP concentrations averaging approximately 8.5 times higher than the bucket samples per L of water (at the site level), largely driven by differences in the number of microfibres. There was no significant difference in PNP concentration between shellfish farms and unfarmed sites. An analysis of MP concentrations and mesh sizes reported in the literature suggests that using a 300-350-Î¼m mesh may underestimate total MP concentrations by one to four orders of magnitude compared with samples that are filtered through much smaller mesh sizes (e.g. <100â€¯Î¼m), despite the effect of sample volume. Particles <300â€¯Î¼m in diameter make up a large component of MPs commonly found in fish and invertebrates. As such, common sampling practices fail to adequately measure a biologically relevant class of MPs, thereby undermining the ability to quantify ecological risk. We suggest that seawater sampling methods be designed to filter to <10â€¯Î¼m (the approximate width of many microfibres), either using pressurized pumps for large-volume samples, or by using sufficient replication of small-volume discrete samples."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30826673,

The outdoor service lifetimes of these materials are influenced by their rates of degradation under solar UV radiation as well as by other climate factors such as temperature, moisture, and atmospheric pollutants. While recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer is expected, local increases in UV radiation are still likely to occur, especially in the tropics, but also elsewhere because of climate change effects. Such increases, when taken together with an increased ambient temperature due to climate change, can significantly shorten the service lifetimes of organic building materials. Several proven technologies, including the use of UV stabilisers, surface treatments or coatings have been developed over the years to mitigate these adverse effects. While these technologies should be able to compensate for any realistic future UV radiation and climate change scenarios, they will also add significantly to the lifetime cost of material in relevant products. Shorter outdoor lifetime of the plastic components in photovoltaic (PV) modules is a serious concern in the solar energy industry. To ensure module durability over the full service-lifetime (of about âˆ¼20 years) of the light-harvesting PV components, better stabilisation technologies are being investigated. The present trend towards more environmentally sustainable materials in building, and environmental impact of additives such as stabilisers, need to be considered in addition to their engineering performance. This may require the phasing out of some conventional additives used in plastics as well as substituting wood or other materials in place of plastics in buildings. Depending on the relative costs of mitigation, substituting more UV-stable materials for conventional ones in outdoor products may also be a viable option with some categories of products. Neither the global cost of mitigation of the effects of climate change on materials nor the long-term sustainability of the technologies available for the purpose, have been estimated. Plastic waste and litter exposed outdoors to solar UV radiation over extended periods undergo cracking and fragmentation into small pieces (of micro- and nano-scale size). Release of these fragments into the environment, particularly in the aquatic environment, poses a potential threat to marine biota. Already several hundred of species are known to ingest these fragments that can potentially accumulate additives and pollutants from water. This is a potential threat to humans because 25% of fish marketed for human consumption have been reported to contain microplastics in their digestive systems. The focus of this assessment is on recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of UV-radiation-induced degradation in materials and in assessing emerging technologies for their stabilisation against outdoor UV-degradation. A better understanding of the mechanisms of degradation will allow for innovative stabilisation approaches to be developed. Also assessed is information on the sustainability of the available and emerging UV stabilisation technologies."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30810563,

TiO(2) -NP did not cause genetic damage to RBC, but acutely decreased white blood cells (WBC) and increased monocytes. Subchronically, RBC decreased, mean cell volume and hemoglobin increased, and WBC and lymphocytes decreased. Therefore, NP has the potential to affect immune system and increase energy expenditure, reducing the fish's ability to avoid predator and to resist pathogens. In the liver, acute exposure decreased ROS and increased glutathione (GSH) content, while subchronic exposure decreased superoxide dismutase activity and increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity and GSH content. GSH and GST seem to play an essential role in metabolizing NP and ROS, likely increasing hepatocytes' metabolic rate, which may be the cause of observed cell hypertrophy, disarrangement of hepatic cords and degenerative morphological alterations. Although most studies indicate that the kidney is responsible for metabolizing and/or eliminating TiO(2) -NP, this study shows that the liver also has a main role in these processes. Nevertheless, Ti still accumulated in the liver, muscle, and brain and decreased muscular AChE activity after acute exposure, showing neurotoxic potential.

However, it is an enormous challenge to the researchers to engineer the above-mentioned features into a single nanocarrier particle. New frontiers in nanomedicine are advancing the research of new biomaterials. In this study, we demonstrate a strategy for glioma targeting by encapsulating vincristine sulfate (VCR) into a naturally available low-density lipoprotein particles (LDL)-based drug delivery system with the modification of T7 peptide ligand (T7-LDL). LDL, endogenous lipid transporters, can specifically bind to brain endothelial cells and glioma cells via interacting with the low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR). T7 is a seven-peptide ligand of transferrin receptors (TfR) capable of circumventing the BBB and then targeting glioma. By combining the dual-targeting delivery effect of T7 peptide and parent LDL, T7-LDL displayed higher glioma localization than that of parent LDL. After loading with VCR, T7-LDL showed the most favorable antiglioma effect in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrated that T7-LDL is an important potential drug delivery system for glioma-targeted therapy."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",30394123,PMC6225487

Though traditionally seen as a macroscopic problem (i.e., large plastic debris), plastic pollution is also evident at smaller scales. Indeed, the intentional industrial production of small plastic particles and the physical degradation of larger plastic debris have overtime resulted in an increased environmental prevalence of smaller plastic particles, including microplastics. While the effects of these small polymers on marine biota have been an important research focus, recent global surveys indicate that our freshwater lakes and rivers are also plagued by microplastics. However, despite these discoveries we currently have a limited understanding of the impact these particles may have on freshwater animals, particularly on vertebrate species. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the impact of high concentrations of microplastics (5 and 20â€¯mg.L(-1)) on the early life stages in zebrafish, a model freshwater vertebrate model. To do this, we exposed embryonic and larval zebrafish to fluorescently labelled polyethylene microspheres for up to 14 days and assessed their microplastic content, growth, hatching and oxygen consumption rates. We then explored the molecular underpinnings of the microplastic response by RNA sequencing. Over the course of the exposure, we observed a consistent accumulation of microplastics in the gastrointestinal tract of the fish in a concentration dependent manner, but could not detect any detrimental effects of these particles on larval development, growth or metabolism. However, whole animal transcriptomics revealed that microplastics induced a transient and extensive change in larval gene expression within 48â€¯h exposure, which largely disappeared by 14 days. However, as these transcriptional changes occurred during a critical period of larval development, we suggest that an evaluation of the potential long-term impact of these particles is warranted."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Maybe""}",30218869,

In this study, the priority microplastics identified in a mariculture farm in Xiangshan Bay, China, including polyethylene (PE) and nylon fibers (i.e., derived from new fishing ropes and nets), were examined for their sorption behaviors. The results indicate that both plastic fibers show linear isotherms towards phenanthrene, a common target hydrophobic organic contaminant (HOC), revealing the characteristics of a partitioning mechanism. The sorption capacity of PE fiber was found to be 1-2 orders of magnitude higher (evaluated by Freundlich parameter log K(F)) than that of nylon fiber, suggesting the importance of plastic surface functional groups (i.e., with or without hydrophilic groups). By comparing carbon normalized log K(F) with literature data, the organic affinity of PE fiber was found to be 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than that of vectors, such as carbonaceous geosorbents (CG), but was 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that of marine sediments. Small size and rough surface tended to enhance the sorption of plastic fibers of phenanthrene. In addition, phenol (log K(OW): 1.46), a low-hydrophobicity compound, showed approximately 3 orders of magnitude lower sorption amounts onto both fibers compared to phenanthrene (log K(OW): 4.46), indicating the selectivity of hydrophobicity.

In this context, biodegradable nanocarriers or nanocapsules capable of carrying bioactive molecules or drugs into the mitochondrial matrix could offer new capabilities in treating mitochondrial diseases. Nanocapsules with a polymeric backbone that undergoes programmed rupture in response to a specific chemical or enzymatic stimulus with subsequent release of the bioactive molecule or drug at mitochondria would be particularly attractive for this function. With this goal in mind, we have developed biologically benign nanocapsules using polyurethane-based, polymeric backbone that incorporates repetitive ester functionalities. The resulting nanocapsules are found to be highly stable and monodispersed in size. Importantly, a new non-isocyanate route is adapted for the synthesis of these non-isocyanate polyurethane nanocapsules (NIPU). The embedded ester linkages of these capsules' shells have facilitated complete degradation of the polymeric backbone in response to a stimulus provided by an esterase enzyme. Hydrophilic payloads like rhodamine or doxorubicin can be loaded inside these nanocarriers during their synthesis by an interfacial polymerization reaction. The postgrafting of the nanocapsules with phosphonium ion, a mitochondria-targeting receptor functionality, has helped us achieve the site-specific release of the drug. Co-localization experiments with commercial mitotracker green as well as mitotracker deep red confirmed localization of the cargo in mitochondria. Our in vitro studies confirm that specific release of doxorubicin within mitochondria causes higher cytotoxicity and cell death compared to free doxorubicin. Endogenous enzyme triggered nanocapsule rupture and release of the encapsulated dye is also demonstrated in a zebrafish model.

Average compressive tractions on an ERMG are 570â€‰Pa within cell layers and 360â€‰Pa in tumor-repopulating cell (TRC) colonies grown in 400-Pa matrices. 3D compressive tractions on a 1.4-kPa ERMG are applied by surrounding cells via endogenous actomyosin forces but not via mature focal adhesions. Compressive stresses are substantially heterogeneous on ERMGs within a uniform cell colony and do not increase with TRC colony sizes. Early-stage zebrafish embryos generate spatial and temporal differences in local normal and shear stresses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: EP/AgNPs were synthesized using methanol/water bark extract of E. polystachya and characterized using various physicochemical techniques. RESULTS: Immersion of adult zebrafish in 111 mM glucose solution resulted in a sustained hyperglycemic, hyperlipidemic state, and serum insulin levels decreased. The synthesized EP/AgNPs showed an absorption peak at 413 nm on ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, revealing the surface plasmon resonance of the nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that most of the particles were spherical, with a diameter of 10-12 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.197, and a zeta potential of -32.25 mV, suggesting high stability of the nanoparticles. EP/AgNPs promote pancreatic Î²-cell survival, insulin secretion, enhanced hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia in glucose-induced diabetic zebrafish. EP/AgNPs also showed protection of the pancreatic Î²-cell line INS-1 against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative injury. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that EP/AgNPs have good antidiabetic activity and therefore could be used to prevent the development of diabetes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,3 - Intervention",29750032,PMC5936013

Therefore, a novel multifunctional hypoxia-induced size-shrinkable nanoparticle has been designed to increase the penetration of drugs, nucleic acids, or probes into tumors. This cooperative strategy relies on three aspects: (i) the responsiveness of nanoparticles to hypoxia, which shrink when triggered by low oxygen concentrations; (ii) the core of a nanoparticle involves an internal cavity and strong positive charges on the surface to deliver both doxorubicin and siRNA; and (iii) a reactive oxygen species (ROS) probe is incorporated in the nanoparticle to monitor its preliminary therapeutic response in real time, which is expected to realize the enhanced efficacy together with the ability to self-monitor the anticancer activity. A more effective inhibition of tumor growth was observed in tumor-bearing zebrafish, demonstrating the feasibility of this cooperative strategy for in vivo applications. This research highlights a promising value in delivering drugs, nucleic acids, or probes to a tumor's core for cancer imaging and treatment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Hypoxia-induced chemoresistance of tumor cells still represents a formidable barrier, as it is difficult for existing drug delivery systems to penetrate the tumor hypoxia core. This study involves the hypoxia-responsive size-shrinkable nanoparticle co-delivery of DOX and siRNA to enhance the penetration of DOX deep within tumors and subsequently disturb crucial pathways of cancer development induced by hypoxia and to improve sensitization to DOX chemotherapy. Furthermore, the nanopreparation can combine the ROS probe as a self-reporting nanopreparation to realize the function of real-time feedback efficacy, which has a good application prospect in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ?,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",29545193,

Although RNA interference (RNAi) has been used in human trials via silencing specific genes, the cartilage RNAi has not been possible to date because the cartilage is an avascular and very dense tissue with very low permeability. PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to develop and validate a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-siRNA delivery system that can prevent cartilage degeneration by knocking down specific genes. METHODS: LNP transfection efficiency was evaluated in vitro and ex vivo. Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) has been correlated with cartilage degeneration. The in vivo effects of LNP-Ihh siRNA complexes on cartilage degeneration were evaluated in a rat model of surgery-induced osteoarthritis (OA). RESULTS: In vitro, 100% of chondrocytes were transfected with siRNA in the LNP-siRNA group. In accordance with the cell culture results, red positive signals could be detected even in the deep layer of cartilage tissue cultures treated by LNP-beacon. In vivo data showed that LNP is specific for cartilage, since positive signals were detected by fluorescence molecular tomography and confocal microscopy in joint cartilage injected with LNP-beacon, but not on the surface of the synovium. In the rat model of OA, intraarticular injection of LNP-Ihh siRNA attenuated OA progression, and PCR results showed LNP-Ihh siRNA exerted a positive impact on anabolic metabolism and negative impact on catabolic metabolism. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that our LNP-RNAi delivery system has a significantly chondroprotective effect that attenuates cartilage degeneration and holds great promise as a powerful tool for treatment of cartilage diseases by knocking down specific genes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",29440889,PMC5798567

Spironolactone micelles (0.1%, w/v) with a mean number weighted diameter of 20 nm were prepared using a pegylated copolymer (mPEG-dihexPLA) and showed a preliminary stability of at least 12 months at 5 Â°C. Preclinical studies in New Zealand white rabbits demonstrated that the 0.1% spironolactone micellar formulation was well-tolerated since no reaction was observed in the cornea following multiple daily instillation over 5 days. As expected, the preclinical studies also confirmed that dexamethasone significantly delayed epithelial wound healing as compared to untreated control (percentage re-epithelialization after day 4: 84.6 Â± 13.9% versus 99.5 Â± 1.0% for the control, p < 0.05). However, the addition of the 0.1% spironolactone micellar formulation significantly improved the extent of re-epithelialization, countering the dexamethasone induced delayed wound healing with a percentage re-epithelialization that was statistically equivalent to the control (96.9 Â± 7.3% versus 99.5 Â± 1.0%, p > 0.05). The biodistribution study provided insight into the ocular metabolism of spironolactone and hence the relative contributions of the parent molecule and its two principal metabolites, 7Î±-thiomethylspironolactone and canrenone, to the observed pharmacological effects. Comparison of the efficacies of spironolactone and potassium canrenoate (a water-soluble precursor of canrenone) in overcoming the dexamethasone-induced delayed wound healing confirmed that the former had greater efficacy. The results pointed to the greater potency of 7Î±-thiomethylspironolactone over canrenone as a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, which explained its superior ability in countering the glucocorticoid-induced overactivation that was responsible for the delayed wound healing. In conclusion, the preliminary results supported the above-mentioned hypothesis suggesting that coadministration of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists to patients under glucocorticoid therapy might prevent the deleterious effects of glucocorticoids on complex corneal wound healing processes."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",29397733,

Currently, there is no evidence that engineered NMs cause detrimental health effects in humans. However, investigation of NM toxicity using in vivo, in vitro, in chemico, and in silico models has demonstrated that some NMs stimulate oxidative stress and inflammation, which may lead to adverse health effects. Accordingly, investigation of these responses currently dominates NM safety assessments. There is a need to reduce reliance on rodent testing in nanotoxicology for ethical, financial and legislative reasons, and due to evidence that rodent models do not always predict the human response. We advocate that in vitro models and zebrafish embryos should have greater prominence in screening for NM safety, to better align nanotoxicology with the 3Rs principles. Zebrafish are accepted for use by regulatory agencies in chemical safety assessments (e.g. developmental biology) and there is growing acceptance of their use in biomedical research, providing strong foundations for their use in nanotoxicology. We suggest that investigation of the response of phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils, macrophages) in vitro should also form a key part of NM safety assessments, due to their prominent role in the first line of defense. The development of a tiered testing strategy for NM hazard assessment that promotes the more widespread adoption of non-rodent, alternative models and focuses on investigation of inflammation and oxidative stress could make nanotoxicology testing more ethical, relevant, and cost and time efficient."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",29239234,

While the toxicity of macroplastics and microplastics is relatively well studied, the toxicity of nanoplastics is largely uncharacterized. Here, fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) were used to investigate the potential toxicity of nanoplastics in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio), as well as to characterize the uptake and distribution of the particles within embryos and larvae. Zebrafish embryos at 6h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to PS NPs (0.1, 1, or 10ppm) until 120 hpf. Our results demonstrate that PS NPs accumulated in the yolk sac as early as 24 hpf and migrated to the gastrointestinal tract, gallbladder, liver, pancreas, heart, and brain throughout development (48-120 hpf). Accumulation of PS NPs decreased during the depuration phase (120-168 hpf) in all organs, but at a slower rate in the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. Notably, exposure to PS NPs did not induce significant mortality, deformities, or changes to mitochondrial bioenergetics, but did decrease the heart rate. Lastly, exposure to PS NPs altered larval behavior as evidenced by swimming hypoactivity in exposed larvae. Taken together, these data suggest that at least some nanoplastics can penetrate the chorion of developing zebrafish, accumulate in the tissues, and affect physiology and behavior, potentially affecting organismal fitness in contaminated aquatic ecosystems."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Maybe""}",29197232,PMC6959514

In this study, zebrafish Danio rerio and nematode Caenorhabditis elegans were used as model organisms for microplastic exposure in freshwater pelagic (i.e. water column) and benthic (i.e. sediment) environments. We investigated the toxic effects of five common types of microplastics: polyamides (PA), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polystyrene (PS) particles. Results showed no or low lethality in D. rerio after exposure for 10d at 0.001-10.0mgL(-1) microplastics. The PA, PE, PP and/or PVC microplastics with ~70Î¼m size caused intestinal damage including cracking of villi and splitting of enterocytes. Exposure to 5.0mgm(-2) microplastics for 2d significantly inhibited survival rates, body length and reproduction of C. elegans. Moreover, exposure to microplastics reduced calcium levels but increased expression of the glutathione S-transferase 4 enzyme in the intestine, which indicates intestinal damage and oxidative stress are major effects of microplastic exposure. Among 0.1, 1.0 and 5.0Î¼m sizes of fluorescently labeled PS, 1.0Î¼m particles caused the highest lethality, the maximum accumulation, the lowest Ca(2+) level in the intestine and the highest expression of glutathione S-transferase 4 in nematodes. Taken together, these findings suggest that intestinal damage is a key effect of microplastics; and that the toxicity of microplastics is closely dependent on their size, rather than their composition."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Maybe""}",29136530,

The study focuses mainly on the European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus but concerns also the European pilchard Sardina pilchardus and the Atlantic herring Clupea harengus. Two complementary methodologies were used to attest the occurrence of MPs in the hepatic tissue and to exclude contamination. 1) MPs were isolated by degradation of the hepatic tissue. 2) Cryosections were made on the livers and observed in polarized light microscopy. Both methods separately revealed that MPs, mainly polyethylene (PE), were translocated into the livers of the three clupeid species. In anchovy, 80 per cent of livers contained relatively large MPs that ranged from 124Â Î¼m to 438Â Î¼m, showing a high level of contamination. Two translocation pathways are hypothesized: (i) large particles found in the liver resulted from the agglomeration of smaller pieces, and/or (ii) they simply pass through the intestinal barrier.

Reservoirs are suspected to be particularly vulnerable to microplastic pollution. However, very limited information is currently available on pollution characteristics of microplastics in reservoir ecosystems. This work studied the distribution and characteristics of microplastics in the backwater area of Xiangxi River, a typical tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir. Microplastics were detected in both surface water and sediment with concentrations ranging from 0.55 Ã— 10(5) to 342 Ã— 10(5) items km(-2) and 80 to 864 items m(-2), respectively. Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene were identified in surface water, whereas polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate, and pigments were observed in sediment. In addition, microplastics were also detected in the digestion tracts of 25.7% of fish samples, and polyethylene and nylon were identified. Redundancy analysis indicates a weak correlation between microplastics and water quality variables but a negative correlation with water level of the reservoir and Secchi depth. Results from this study confirm the presence of high abundance microplastics in reservoir impacted tributaries, and suggest that water level regulated hydrodynamic condition and input of nonpoint sources are important regulators for microplastic accumulation and distribution in the backwater area of reservoir tributaries."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",28298079,

The particle size (about 34â€‰nm), morphology, X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), in vitro release profile, cytotoxicity and cell proliferation effects were studied in detail. The results indicated that honokiol and doxorubicin could be efficiently loaded into MPEG-PCL nanoparticles simultaneously, and could be released from the micelles in an extended period in vitro. In addition, honokiol and doxorubicin loaded in MPEG-PCL nanoparticles could efficiently suppress glioma cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, Dox-HK-MPEG-PCL micelles inhibited glioma growth more significantly than Dox-MPEG-PCL and HK-MPEG-PCL in both nude mice and zebrafish tumor models. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that DOX-HK-MPEG-PCL micelles improved Dox's anti-tumor effect by enhancing tumor cell apoptosis, suppressing tumor cell proliferation, and inhibiting angiogenesis.

Results showed that microplastics alone exhibited no significant effects except for the upregulated zfrho visual gene expression; whereas nanoplastics inhibited the larval locomotion by 22% during the last darkness period, and significantly reduced larvae body length by 6%, inhibited the acetylcholinesterase activity by 40%, and upregulated gfap, Î±1-tubulin, zfrho and zfblue gene expression significantly. When co-exposed with 2Î¼g/L 17 Î±-ethynylestradiol (EE2), microplastics led to alleviation on EE2's inhibition effect on locomotion, which was probably due to the decreased freely dissolved EE2 concentration. However, though nanoplastics showed stronger adsorption ability for EE2, the hypoactivity phenomenon still existed in the nanoplastics co-exposure group. Moreover, when co-exposed with a higher concentration of EE2 (20Î¼g/L), both plastics showed an enhanced effect on the hypoactivity. Principal component analysis was performed to reduce data dimensions and four principal components were reconstituted in terms of oxidative stress, body length, nervous and visual system related genes explaining 84% of total variance. Furthermore, oxidative damage and body length reduction were evaluated to be main reasons for the hypoactivity. Therefore, nanoplastics alone suppressed zebrafish larvae locomotor activity and both plastic particles can change the larvae swimming behavior when co-exposed with EE2.

Microplastics are emerging pollutants of increasing environmental concern with a particle size of <5Â mm, which originate from successive degradation of larger plastic debris or are manufactured as small granules and used in many applications. The impact of microplastics pollution on the environment and biota is not well known. Vast data exist in the literature on marine microplastics while reports on freshwater ecosystems are scarce. In this context, to examine the occurrence of microplastic particles (MPs) in the Vembanad Lake, samples were collected from ten sites and processed for microplastic extraction through density separation. Identification of the polymer components of MPs was done using micro Raman spectroscopy. MPs were recovered from all sediment samples, indicating their extensive distribution in the lake. The abundance of MPs recorded from the sediment samples is in the range of 96-496 particles m(-2) with a mean abundance of 252.80Â Â±Â 25.76 particles m(-2). Low density polyethylene has been identified as the dominant type of polymer component of the MPs. As clams and fishes are the major source of protein to the local population, the presence of MPs in the lake becomes critically important, posing a severe threat of contaminating the food web of this lake.

Lipid alterations in male and female zebrafish were explored post-exposure in three target tissues (brain, gonads and gastrointestinal tract) using 'omic' procedures based in liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data files. These tissues were chosen as they are often target tissues following environmental exposure. Marked alterations in lipid species are noted in all three tissues. To further explore CBN-induced brain alterations, Raman microspectroscopy analysis of lipid extracts was conducted. Marked lipid alterations are observed with males responding differently to females; in addition, there also appears to be consistent elevations in global genomic methylation. This latter observation is most profound in female zebrafish brain tissues post-exposure to short MWCNTs or SWCNTs (P < 0.05).

Hence, we designed novel antitumor combinations (T-NPs) by integrating the tumor vascular and tumor cells dual-targeting ligand with antiangiogenesis/antitumor agents. The truncated bFGF peptide (tbFGF), which could effectively bind to FGFR1 overexpressed on tumor neovasculature endothelial cells and tumor cells, was selected to modify PLGA nanoparticles (D/P-NPs) simultaneously loaded with PEDF gene and paclitaxel in this study. The obtained T-NPs with better pharmaceutical properties had elevated cytotoxicity and enhanced expression of PEDF and Î±-tubulin on FGFR1-overexpressing cells. The uptake of T-NPs increased in C26 cells, probably mediated by tbFGF via specific recognization of the overexpressed FGFR1. T-NPs dramatically disrupted the tube formation of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and displayed improved antiangiogenic activity in the transgenic zebrafish model and the alginate-encapsulated tumor cell model. More importantly, T-NPs achieved a markedly higher antitumor efficacy in the C26 tumor-bearing mice model. The antitumor effect involved the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis, induction of apoptosis, and down-regulation of FGFR1. The enhanced antitumor activity of T-NPs probably resulted from the raised distribution in tumor tissues. In addition, T-NPs had no obvious toxicity as evaluated by weight monitoring, serological/biochemical analyses, and H&E staining. These results revealed that T-NPs, an active targeting gene/chemo-therapy, indeed had superior antitumor efficacy and negligible side effect, suggesting that this novel combination is a potential tumor therapy and a new treatment strategy and that the tbFGF modified nanoparticles could be applied to a wide range of tumor-genetic therapies and/or tumor-chemical therapies."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ?,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",27615739,

Although it possesses powerful antitumor activity, its clinical application is seriously encumbered by its unselective distribution and systemic toxicities, particularly myocardial toxicity. Thus, it is imperative to modify Dox to decrease its systemic toxicities and improve its therapeutic index. In the present study, we adopted a novel type of monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(Îµ-caprolactone) (MPEG-PCL) micelles to encapsulate Dox to prepare Dox-loaded MPEG-PCL (Dox/MPEG-PCL) nanoparticles by a controllable self-assembly process. The cellular uptake efficiency and cell proliferation inhibition of the Dox/MPEG-PCL nanoparticles were examined. The antitumor activity of the Dox/MPEG-PCL nanoparticles was tested on a multiple pulmonary metastasis model of melanoma on C57BL/6Â mice. Systemic toxicities and survival time were compared between the mice treated with the Dox/MPEG-PCL nanoparticles and free Dox. The potential myocardial toxicity of the Dox/MPEG-PCL nanoparticles was investigated using a prolonged observation period. Encapsulation of Dox in MPEG-PCL nanoparticles significantly improved the cellular uptake and cell proliferation inhibition of Dox inÂ vivo. Intravenous injection of Dox/MPEG-PCL nanoparticles obtained significant inhibition of the growth and metastasis of melanoma in the lung and prolonged survival time compared with free Dox (P<0.05). The Dox/MPEG-PCL nanoparticles did not show obvious additional systemic toxicities compared with free Dox during the treatment time. During the prolonged observation period, obvious decreased cardiac toxicity was observed in the Dox/MPEG-PCL nanoparticle-treated mice compared with that observed in the free Dox-treated mice. These results indicated that encapsulating Dox with MPEG-PCL micelles could significantly promote its antitumor activity and reduce its toxicity to the myocardium."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",27109195,

As resistance to antibiotics becomes more common, a greater need for alternative treatments is needed. Nanodiamond particles (NDPs) are actively researched as drug delivery platforms due to their biocompatibility, particle size, and stable inert core. This research is aimed at developing NDPs as antibiotic drug delivery platforms for treating UTIs. To this end, 100 nm, 75 nm, 25 nm and 6 nm size NDPs are purified with acid and heat treatment techniques. Raman spectra of the NDPs showed that the acid treatment method resulted in higher diamond yield. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies showed that both purification techniques result in oxygen terminated surface groups. Efficiency of loading amoxicillin on 25 nm NDPs based on electrostatic interaction of NDPs, functionalizing surfaces of NDPs with hydrogen, and polyethylenimine (PEI) are investigated. It is found that the electrostatic and surface hydrogenation approaches are not efficient in loading amoxicillin on the NDPs. On the other hand, PEI functionalized NDPs produced successful loading with amoxicillin as indicated by the presence of the Î²-lactam peak at 1770 cm(-1), amide peak at 1680 cm(-1), and bond between PEI NH stretching and amoxicillin -COOH group at 3650 cm(-1) by the FTIR spectra.

According to recent estimates, about 3.2 billion people, almost half of the world's population, are at risk of malaria. Malaria control is particularly challenging due to a growing number of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium and pesticide-resistant Anopheles vectors. Newer and safer control tools are required. In this research, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were biosynthesized using a cheap flower extract of Couroupita guianensis as reducing and stabilizing agent. The biofabrication of AuNP was confirmed by UV-vis spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), zeta potential, and particle size analysis. AuNP showed different shapes including spheres, ovals, and triangles. AuNPs were crystalline in nature with face-centered cubic geometry; mean size was 29.2-43.8Â nm. In laboratory conditions, AuNPs were toxic against Anopheles stephensi larvae, pupae, and adults. LC50 was 17.36Â ppm (larva I), 19.79Â ppm (larva II), 21.69Â ppm (larva III), 24.57Â ppm (larva IV), 28.78Â ppm (pupa), and 11.23Â ppm (adult). In the field, a single treatment with C. guianensis flower extract and AuNP (10â€‰Ã—â€‰LC50) led to complete larval mortality after 72Â h. In standard laboratory conditions, the predation efficiency of golden wonder killifish, Aplocheilus lineatus, against A. stephensi IV instar larvae was 56.38Â %, while in an aquatic environment treated with sub-lethal doses of the flower extract or AuNP, predation efficiency was boosted to 83.98 and 98.04Â %, respectively. Lastly, the antiplasmodial activity of C. guianensis flower extract and AuNP was evaluated against CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. IC50 of C. guianensis flower extract was 43.21Â Î¼g/ml (CQ-s) and 51.16Â Î¼g/ml (CQ-r). AuNP IC50 was 69.47Â Î¼g/ml (CQ-s) and 76.33Â Î¼g/ml (CQ-r).

The specially-designed PU NPs reduce the gene expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1Î², IL-6, and TNF-Î±) for endotoxin-treated macrophages. The PU NPs increase the intracellular calcium of macrophages (4.5-6.5 fold) and activate autophagy. This is in contrast to the autophagy dysfunction generally observed upon NP exposure. These PU NPs may further decrease the nuclear factor-ÎºB-related inflammation via autophagy pathways. The immunosuppressive activities of PU NPs can prevent animal death by inhibiting the macrophage recruitment and proinflammatory responses, confirmed by an in vivo zebrafish model. Therefore, the novel biodegradable PU NPs demonstrate COO(-) dependent immunosuppressive properties without carrying any anti-inflammatory agents.

OBJECTIVE: A novel spine implant model was designed to study the antimicrobial effect of a modified Titanium (Ti) pedicle screws with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in multiple surgical sites in the lumbar spine of a rabbit. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Infection in spinal implant is of great concern. Anti-infection strategies must be tested in relevant animal models that will lead to appropriate clinical studies. METHODS: Fourteen New Zealand white rabbits were divided into 2 groups: group 1: infected unmodified Ti screw group (n =â€Š 6), and group 2: infected polyethylene glycol grafted, polypropylene-based silver nanoparticle (PP-g-PEG-Ag) covered Ti screw group (n = 6), and 2 rabbits as sterile (sham-operated and control) group. In all groups, left L4-right L6 vertebra levels were exposed and screws were drilled to transverse processes after contamination of burr holes and surrounding tissue with 0.1 mL of 10 colony forming units (CFU) MRSA solutions in groups 1 and 2. After 21 days, samples were collected and infection was analyzed via light and scanning electron microscopy and culturing. Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NP) on the screws and tissues were assayed pre and postoperatively. RESULTS: The bacterial colony count for modified-Ti screw group was lower than for unmodified Ti screw (17.2 versus 200 x 10(3) CFU/mL, P = 0.029) with less biofilm formation. There was no difference in duration of surgery among groups and within the surgical sites. Ag-NPs were detected on the screw surface postoperatively. CONCLUSION: This novel experimental design of implantation in rabbits is easy to apply and resembles human stabilization technique. Modified Ti screws were shown to have antimicrobial effect especially inhibiting the biofilm formation. This anchored Ag NPs that remained after 21st day of implantation shows that it is resistant to tapping forces of the screw."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",26571170,

Early and non-invasive detection of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques (VP) would be significant in preventing some aspects of these syndromes. As a new contrast agent, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) modified ultra-small super paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) was synthesized and used to identify VP and rupture plaque by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: Atherosclerosis was induced in male New Zealand White rabbits by feeding a high cholesterol diet (n = 30). Group A with atherosclerosis plaque (n = 10) were controls. VP was established in groups B (n = 10) and C (n = 10) using balloon-induced endothelial injury of the abdominal aorta. Adenovirus-carrying p53 genes were injected into the aortic segments rich in plaques after 8 weeks. Group C was treated with atorvastatin for 8 weeks. Sixteen weeks later, all rabbits underwent pharmacological triggering, and imaging were taken daily for 5 d after DMSA-USPIO infusion. At the first day and before being killed, serum MMP-9, sCD40L, and other lipid indicators were measured. RESULTS: DMSA-USPIO particles accumulated in VP and rupture plaques. Rupture plaques appeared as areas of hyper-intensity on DMSA-USPIO enhanced MRI, especially T2*-weighted sequences, with a signal strength peaking at 96 h. The group given atorvastatin showed few DMSA-USPIO particles and had lower levels of serum indicators. MMP-9 and sCD40L levels in group B were significantly higher than in the other 2 groups (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: After successfully establishing a VP model in rabbits, DMSA-USPIO was used to enhance MRI for clear identification of plaque inflammation and rupture. Rupture plaques were detectable in this way probably due to an activating inflammatory process. Atorvastatin reduced the inflammatory response and stabilizing VP possibly by decreasing MMP-9 and sCD40L levels."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",25973795,PMC4431872

Strikingly, most work on organisms focuses on sublethal responses to plastic debris. This is controversial because (i) researchers have ignored medical insights about the mechanisms that link effects of debris across lower levels of biological organization to disease and mortality, and (ii) debris is considered non-hazardous by policy-makers, possibly because individuals can be injured or removed from populations and assemblages without ecological impacts. We reviewed the mechanisms that link effects of debris across lower levels of biological organization to assemblages and populations. Using plastic, we show microplastics reduce the 'health', feeding, growth and survival of ecosystem engineers. Larger debris alters assemblages because fishing-gear and tyres kill animals and damage habitat-forming plants, and because floating bottles facilitate recruitment and survival of novel taxa. Where ecological linkages are not known, we show how to establish hypothetical links by synthesizing studies to assess the likelihood of impacts. We also consider how population models examine ecological linkages and guide management of ecological impacts. We show that by focusing on linkages to ecological impacts rather than the presence of debris and its sublethal impacts, we could reduce threats posed by debris."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",25904661,PMC4424639

Upon introducing nanoparticles into a biological milieu, adsorption of proteins and biomolecules onto the nanoparticle surface usually progresses rapidly. Nanoparticles bound with proteins can result in physiological and pathological changes, but the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In order to evaluate how protein corona affected MSNs and the subsequent cellular immune responses, we experimented in both serum and serum-deprived conditions. Our findings indicated that the level of p-p38 was significantly elevated by the positively charged MSNs, whereas negatively charged MSNs resulted in marked ROS production. Most significantly, our experiments demonstrated that the presence of protein efficiently mitigated the potential nano-hazard. On the other hand, strongly positively charged MSNs caused 94% of the zebrafish embryos to die. In that case, the toxicity caused by the quaternary ammonium ligands on the surface of those nanoparticles was exerted in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, these fundamental studies here provide valuable insights into the design of better biocompatible nanomaterials in the future."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",25804371,

However, various conditions used during biopsy processing for histologic analysis may affect the performance of diagnostic tests, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), or in situ hybridization (ISH). One such condition that may affect diagnostic test performance is fixation duration in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). For example, prostate needle biopsies are often <1 mm in diameter and thus overfixed. It is important to understand the impact of tissue fixation duration on diagnostic test performance to enable optimized assay procedures. This study was designed to study the effect of 10% NBF fixation duration of prostate needle biopsy on multiplexed quantum dot (QD) ISH assay of ERG and PTEN, 2 genes commonly altered in prostate cancer. The samples were also evaluated for H&E staining and ERG and PTEN IHC. H&E staining and ERG and PTEN IHC were acceptable for all the durations of fixation tested. For QD ISH, we observed good signals with biopsy samples fixed from 4 to 120 hours. Biopsy specimens fixed between 8 and 72 hours gave the best signal as scored by the study pathologist. In a separate cohort of 18 routinely processed prostate biopsy cores, all cores were stained successfully with the QD ISH assay, and results were 100% concordant to ERG and PTEN IHC.

Our aim was to test the association of a lipophilic derivative of methotrexate, didodecyl-methotrexate (ddMTX) to LDE on the lesions and on the expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes. METHODS: Twenty male New Zealand rabbits were fed 1Â % cholesterol diet for 60Â days. Starting from day 30, 10 animals were treated with 4 weekly LDE-ddMTX injections (4Â mg/kg, I.V.) and 10 with LDE injections (20Â mg LDE total lipid mass/kg). RESULTS: LDE-ddMTX reduced the size of the lesion areas by 65Â % and the intima-media ratio by 2-fold. Reduction of intimal macrophage was 67Â % and of apoptotic cells was 88Â %. Smooth muscle cells migration into the intima was unaffected. LDE-ddMTX treatment diminished metalloproteinase-9 in the intima. In aortas of atherosclerotic rabbits, downregulation of 6 pro-inflammatory genes, TNF-Î±, MCP-1, IL-1Î², IL-18, MMP-9, MMP-12 and upregulation of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 gene were observed. Incubation of LDE-ddMTX with HUVEC cells led to downregulation of TNF-Î± IL1-Î² VAP-1, TLR2 and CXCL2. CONCLUSIONS: LDE-ddMTX is potentially useful to threat atherosclerosis by acting on inflammatory processes which are instrumental in the development of the disease."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",24065615,

In this work, a redox-responsive drug/siRNA codelivery vehicle based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles was fabricated to simultaneously deliver siRNA and doxorubicin (Dox) in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: The nanoparticle surface was functionalized with the adamantane (AD) units. Formation of stable host-guest complex between disulfide bond linked-AD and ethylenediamine-modified Î²-cyclodextrin is capable of fully blocking drugs inside the nanopores, while amino groups can complex with siRNA via electrostatic interaction. Relatively high concentration of glutathione in biophysical environment provides natural reducing agent to trigger drug/siRNA release by cleaving pre-introduced disulfide bonds. B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) siRNA was codelivered to silence Bcl-2 protein expression in HeLa cells, resulting in enhanced chemotherapy efficacy in vitro. In vivo delivery experiment carried out in transgenic zebrafish larvae indicates that the delivery of Dox inhibits the development of choroid plexus in a dose-dependent manner, leading to successful decrease of green fluorescence protein transcription in choroid plexus. Reduction of liver tumor was also demonstrated after injection of Dox-loaded nanoparticles. INNOVATION: We successfully demonstrated that functional nanoparticles could serve as an efficient carrier for the delivery of Bcl-2 siRNA and Dox in HeLa cells and in transgenic zebrafish larvae, leading to enhanced therapeutic efficacy. CONCLUSION: Enhanced cytotoxicity caused by simultaneous delivery of Bcl-2 siRNA and Dox was observed in HeLa cells.

Results show a general GST activity increase according to TiOâ‚‚ NPs concentrations, which is in agreement with data from LPO. After 21 days, GST activities decreased possibly caused by suppression of GST synthesis as a result of severe stress.

We injected Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) intramuscularly with a plasmid vector containing a luciferase (Photinus pyralis) reporter gene as a) naked pDNA, b) encapsulated into PLGA nano- (~320 nm) (NP) or microparticles (~4 Î¼m) (MP), c) in an oil-based formulation, or with empty particles of both sizes. The ability of the different pDNA-treatments to induce transgene expression was analyzed through a 70-day experimental period. Anatomical distribution patterns and depot effects were determined by tracking isotope labeled pDNA. Muscle, head kidney and spleen from all treatment groups were analyzed for proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î±, IL-1Î²), antiviral genes (IFN-Î±, Mx) and cytotoxic T-cell markers (CD8, Eomes) at mRNA transcription levels at days 1, 2, 4 and 7. Histopathological examinations were performed on injection site samples from days 2, 7 and 30. Injection of either naked pDNA or the oil-formulation was superior to particle treatments for inducing transgene expression at early time-points. Empty particles of both sizes were able to induce proinflammatory immune responses as well as degenerative and inflammatory pathology at the injection site. Microparticles demonstrated injection site depots and an inflammatory pathology comparable to the oil-based formulation. In comparison, the distribution of NP-encapsulated pDNA resembled that of naked pDNA, although encapsulation into NPs significantly elevated the expression of antiviral genes in all tissues.

This work is focused on the chemical vapor deposition conditions that yield nanopatterns with multilayer thickness. The supra-monolayer n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) nanoring patterns are made using polystyrene particle lithography. The supra-monolayer nanopatterns are used as ""nano-flasks"" to deposit and nucleate nanoparticles of small organic molecules including n-docosane, aspirin, and clarithromycin. The supra-monolayer OTS nanopattern is an effective template for nanoparticle array deposition of all three chemicals with high degree of fidelity to the substrate pattern. The nanoparticle size is varied by solution concentration. The preferential deposition of the organic molecules inside the nanoring is attributed to the dewetting of the liquid film on the nanopattern.

The shift in swimming speed distribution in the TiO(2) NP-exposed fish was associated with decreased area of red pulp in the spleen, increases in haematocrit and whole blood haemoglobin, all consistent with a compensation for respiratory hypoxia without the accumulation of plasma lactate. Fish exposed to TiO(2) NPs also retained competitive abilities when paired with controls in aggressive social encounters. The duration of competitive contests, the level of aggression and contest outcome were not affected by NP exposure. Neurological injury did not explain the changes in locomotor behaviour, although there was some apparent enlargement of the blood vessels on the brain.

To address these challenges, we investigated the promising application of deguelin in the intravesical therapy of bladder cancer by designing a novel intravesical drug delivery system for deguelin. It was found that deguelin could efficiently kill bladder cancer cells and inhibit angiogenesis. Intravesically administrated deguelin had better tolerance than systemically applied deguelin. Encapsulation of deguelin in cationic DOTAP and monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(Îµ-caprolactone) (MPEG-PCL) hybrid nanoparticles (DMP) created the deguelin loaded DMP nanoparticles (D/DMP). They had a mean particle size of 35 nm and zeta potential of 21 mV, rendering deguelin completely dispersible in aqueous media. Encapsulation of deguelin in cationic DMP nanoparticles enhanced the anticancer activity of deguelin in vitro. In addition, D/DMP nanoparticles were incorporated into a thermo-sensitive Pluronic F127 hydrogel, forming a novel D/DMP-F system, which remained in a flowing liquid state at lower than 25 Â°C, but underwent gelation at higher temperatures. The DMP nanoparticles in the F127 hydrogel system (DMP-F) could significantly extend the hydrophobic drug residence time and increase the drug concentration within the bladder.

The use of nanoparticles in cosmetics, detergents, food and other commercial products is rapidly increasing despite little knowledge of their effect on organism metabolism. We show here that commercially manufactured polystyrene nanoparticles, transported through an aquatic food chain from algae, through zooplankton to fish, affect lipid metabolism and behaviour of the top consumer. At least three independent metabolic parameters differed between control and test fish: the weight loss, the triglyceridesâˆ¶cholesterol ratio in blood serum, and the distribution of cholesterol between muscle and liver. Moreover, we demonstrate that nanoparticles bind to apolipoprotein A-I in fish serum in-vitro, thereby restraining them from properly utilising their fat reserves if absorbed through ingestion. In addition to the metabolic effects, we show that consumption of nanoparticle-containing zooplankton affects the feeding behaviour of the fish. The time it took the fish to consume 95% of the food presented to them was more than doubled for nanoparticle-exposed compared to control fish.

In conclusion, our study shows that from knowledge of the molecular composition of the protein corona around nanoparticles it is possible to make a testable molecular hypothesis and bioassay of the potential biological risks of a defined nanoparticle at the organism and ecosystem level."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Maybe"", ""Angelo""=>""Maybe""}",22384193,PMC3284555

Aluminum nanomaterials are being used in diverse applications that are likely to lead to environmental release and exposure. However, it is unclear if the effects of nanoparticulate aluminum are similar to those of other forms of aluminum or require special consideration. To examine the acute toxicological effects of exposure to aluminum nanoparticle (Al-NP)s, adult female zebrafish were exposed to either Al-NPs or aluminum chloride for up to 48 hours in moderately hard fresh water. Al-NPs introduced into test water rapidly aggregated and up to 80% sedimented from the water column during exposures. No mortality was caused by concentrations of Al-NP up to 12.5 mg/L. After exposure, tissue concentrations of aluminum, effects on gill morphology, Na+, K+ -ATPase (NKA) activity, and global gene expression patterns were examined. Exposure to both aluminum chloride and nanoparticulate aluminum resulted in a concentration dependent decrease in sodium potassium ATPase activity, although Al-NP exposure did not alter gill morphology as measured by filament widths. Decreased ATPase activity coincided with decreases in filamental NKA staining and mucous cell counts. Analysis of gill transcriptional responses demonstrated that exposure to 5 mg/L Al-NP only resulted in significant changes in expression of two genes, whereas aluminum chloride exposure significantly affected the expression of 105 genes. Taken together, these results indicate that nanoparticulate aluminum has little acute toxicity for zebrafish in moderately hard freshwater."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",21910207,

In vitro models indicate that AgNPs are likely to be developmental neurotoxicants with actions distinct from those of Ag(+). We exposed developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) to Ag(+) or AgNPs on days 0-5 post-fertilization and evaluated hatching, morphology, survival and swim bladder inflation. Larval swimming behavior and responses to different lighting conditions were assessed 24h after the termination of exposure. Comparisons were made with AgNPs of different sizes and coatings: 10nm citrate-coated AgNP (AgNP-C), and 10 or 50nm polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated AgNPs (AgNP-PVP). Ag(+) and AgNP-C delayed hatching to a similar extent but Ag(+) was more effective in slowing swim bladder inflation, and elicited greater dysmorphology and mortality. In behavioral assessments, Ag(+) exposed fish were hyperresponsive to light changes, whereas AgNP-C exposed fish showed normal responses. Neither of the AgNP-PVPs affected survival or morphology but both evoked significant changes in swimming responses to light in ways that were distinct from Ag(+) and each other. The smaller AgNP-PVP caused overall hypoactivity whereas the larger caused hyperactivity. AgNPs are less potent than Ag(+) with respect to dysmorphology and loss of viability, but nevertheless produce neurobehavioral effects that highly depend on particle coating and size, rather than just reflecting the release of Ag(+). Different AgNP formulations are thus likely to produce distinct patterns of developmental neurotoxicity."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",21315816,PMC3112298

Data on these BFRs in diverse environmental samples can be found in studies from the 1970s and 1980s, as well as in recent years, though very little in the years in between. Due to a lack of data, the cause for the apparent re-emergence of these BFRs in recent studies is unclear, and could reflect changes in production volumes, accumulation of transformation products from BFR precursors, improved analytical techniques or simply a re-emergence in concern. Very little data are available on their environmentally relevant partitioning properties, which could help to explain the occurrence and fate of these BFRs. In this study we analysed for the presence of HBB, PBT, and PBEB in diverse environmental samples from potential Norwegian BFR source zones. Additionally, environmental partitioning properties of these BFRs as well as brominated benzenes were estimated and validated using experimental data for brominated benzenes. Of the three BFRs, HBB was identified in detectable quantities at most source zones, PBEB only near a metal recycling factory, and PBT only in a few additional locations from where PBEB was detected. Data from this study show that HBB is likely widely distributed, as verified both by chemical analysis and estimated properties. Measured HBB levels in wastewater treatment plants indicate that the treatment practices used in the study locations are not effective at lowering HBB levels, perhaps due to association with low density suspended solids (e.g. microplastics)."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention,1 - Type of study",21140013,

The primary aim of this study was to improve the method of EBV detection by exploring quantum dots in FISH detection, and compare QD-based FISH with conventional ISH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biopsy specimens were retrospectively retrieved from 35 NPC patients as paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. QD-FISH was developed to detect the presence of EBV encoded small RNA (EBER) using biotin-labeled EBER oligonucleotide probe indirectly labeled with streptavidin-conjugated quantum dots. Conventional ISH was also performed using a commercial kit to assess concordance between the two methods. RESULTS: All the 35 NPC cases were nonkeratinizing carcinoma (7 differentiated and 28 undifferentiated subtypes). EBER-positive signals were detected in 91.43% (32/35) and 80% (28/35) cases by QD-FISH and ISH, respectively. There was no significant difference in the number of EBER-positive cases by the two methods. A moderate concordance was found between QD-FISH and ISH for EBER status (Îº=0.55). Four EBER-negative cases by ISH showed EBER-positive signals when detected by QD-FISH. CONCLUSIONS: EBV is closely associated with NPC in Chinese patients.

With observations also made from the ice patrol vessel HMS Endurance in the same season and seabed samples collected from the RRS James Clark Ross, this was the widest survey for plastics ever undertaken around Antarctica. MAIN FEATURES: The 2008 visit of RRS James Clark Ross to the Amundsen Sea breached two last frontiers; the last and most remote sea from which biological samples and plastic debris have been reported. A plastic cup and two fishing buoys were seen in the Durmont D'Urville and Davis seas while two pieces of plastic packaging and a fishing buoy were observed in the Amundsen Sea. Agassiz trawls revealed rich biodiversity on the Amundsen (and south Bellingshausen) seabed but no sunken plastic pieces. We found no microplastics in five epibenthic sledge samples (300 microm mesh) from the Amundsen seabed. The seabeds immediately surrounding continental Antarctica are probably the last environments on the planet yet to be reached by plastics, but with pieces floating into the surface of the Amundsen Sea this seems likely to change soon.

Male New Zealand white rabbits (n = 5) underwent DCE MRI 12-14 days after Vx-2 tumor fragments were implanted into the left hind limb. Each contrast agent (PNs followed by Gd-DTPA) was evaluated using a DCE protocol and transendothelial transfer coefficient (K(i)) maps were calculated using a two-compartment model. Two regions of interest (ROIs) were located within the tumor core and hindlimb muscle and five ROIs were placed within the tumor rim. Comparisons were performed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The K(i) values estimated using PNs were significantly lower than those obtained for Gd-DTPA (p = 0.018). When PNs and Gd-DTPA data were analyzed separately, significant differences were identified among tumor rim ROIs for PNs (p < 0.0001), but not for Gd-DTPA data (p = 0.34). The mean K(i) for the tumor rim was significantly greater than that of either the core or the hindlimb muscle for both contrast agents (p < 0.05 for each comparison). In summary, the extravasation of Gd-DTPA was far greater than that of PNs, suggesting that PNs can reveal regional differences in tumor vascular permeability that are not otherwise apparent with clinical contrast agents such as Gd-DTPA.

DF-1 is a dendrofullerene nanoparticle with antioxidant properties previously found to be radioprotective in a zebrafish model. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the radioprotective effects of DF-1 in a murine model of lethal total body irradiation and to assess for selective radioprotection of normal cells versus tumor cells. METHODS: In vitro radioresponse was evaluated with clonogenic assays with human tumor cells and fibroblast lines in the presence of varying concentrations of DF-1 or vehicle. DNA double strand break induction and repair was evaluated with immunocytochemistry for gammaH2AX. Lethal total body irradiation was delivered with 137Cs after intraperitoneal delivery of DF-1 or vehicle control. Bone marrow hypoxia was evaluated with piminidazole uptake assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: DF-1 provided modest radioprotection of human cancer cell lines and fibroblast cell lines when delivered prior to irradiation (dose modifying factor or 1.1). There was no evidence of selective protection of fibroblasts versus tumor cells. Cells treated with DF-1 at radioprotective doses were found to have fewer gammaH2AX foci at 1 and 6 hours after irradiation compared to vehicle treated controls. The LD50/30 for C57Bl6/Ncr mice treated with a single 300 mg/kg dose of DF-1 pre-irradiation was 10.09 Gy (95% CI 9.58-10.26) versus 8.29 Gy (95% CI, 8.21-8.32) for control mice. No protective effects were seen with a single 200 mg/kg dose. No increase in pimonidazole uptake was appreciated in bone marrow of mice treated with DF-1 compared to vehicle controls.

This study provides evidence that at 10 microg/mL and above, TiO(2) nanoparticles cross the epithelial lining of the intestinal model by transcytosis, albeit at low levels.

Live/dead analysis results did not show cell death after exposure to TiO(2). In addition, at 10 microg/mL (and above) TiO(2) nanoparticles begin alteration of both microvillar organization on the apical surface of the epithelium as well as induce a rise in intracellular-free calcium. The latter is a mechanism cells use to respond to extracellular stimuli and may be linked to the alteration of the apical microvilli.

It has been shown that MRI can detect and quantify specific molecules of interest expressed in cardiovascular disease and cancer by measuring the unique fluorine signature of appropriately targeted perfluorocarbon (PFC) nanoparticles. In this study, we demonstrated specific binding of alphanubeta3 integrin targeted nanoparticles to neovasculature in a rabbit model of aortic valve disease. We also showed that fluorine MRI could be used to detect and quantify the development of neovasculature in the excised aortic valve leaflets. METHODS: New Zealand White rabbits consumed a cholesterol diet for ~180 days and developed aortic valve thickening, inflammation, and angiogenesis mimicking early human aortic valve disease. Rabbits (n = 7) were treated with alphanubeta3 integrin targeted PFC nanoparticles or control untargeted PFC nanoparticles (n = 6). Competitive inhibition in vivo of nanoparticle binding (n = 4) was tested by pretreatment with targeted nonfluorinated nanoparticles followed 2 hours later by targeted PFC nanoparticles. 2 hours after treatment, aortic valves were excised and 19F MRS was performed at 11.7T. Integrated 19F spectral peaks were compared using a one-way ANOVA and Hsu's MCB (multiple comparisons with the best) post hoc t test. In 3 additional rabbits treated with alphanubeta3 integrin targeted PFC nanoparticles, 19F spectroscopy was performed on a 3.0T clinical scanner. The presence of angiogenesis was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Valves of rabbits treated with targeted PFC nanoparticles had 220% more fluorine signal than valves of rabbits treated with untargeted PFC nanoparticles (p < 0.001). Pretreatment of rabbits with targeted oil-based nonsignaling nanoparticles reduced the fluorine signal by 42% due to competitive inhibition, to a level not significantly different from control animals. Nanoparticles were successfully detected in all samples scanned at 3.0T. PECAM endothelial staining and alphanubeta3 integrin staining revealed the presence of neovasculature within the valve leaflets. CONCLUSION: Integrin-targeted PFC nanoparticles specifically detect early angiogenesis in sclerotic aortic valves of cholesterol fed rabbits. These techniques may be useful for assessing atherosclerotic components of preclinical aortic valve disease in patients and could assist in defining efficacy of medical therapies."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",18817557,PMC2561020

Tissue concentration of stented arteries exceeded that of contralateral nonstented arteries by 100-fold 24 hours after administration of 1 mg/kg TRM-484 and resulted in significant reduction of percent stenosis compared to saline and placebo treated rabbits (22.5+/-4.4 versus 31.0+/-8.4 and 29.5+/-8.1%, P<0.03). CONCLUSIONS: TRM-484 at doses of 1 mg/kg resulted in significant suppression of in-stent neointimal growth in atherosclerotic rabbits. Site-specific targeting by this nanoparticle steroid in injured atherosclerotic areas might be a valuable and cost-effective approach for the prevention of in-stent restenosis."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",18688017,

The goal of this work was to develop in vivo lymph tests using the principles of flow cytometry. Cells in living animals were counted by laser (420-2,300 nm) generation of photoacoustic (PA) signals in individual cells hydrodynamically focused by lymph valves into a single file flow, and using endogenous absorption as intrinsic cell-specific markers, or gold nanorods, nanoshells, and carbon nanotubes as multicolor probes. PA data were verified by high-speed transmission, photothermal, and fluorescent imaging. Counting of melanoma and immune-related cells in normal, apoptotic, and necrotic states in lymphatics in vivo was demonstrated to have the unprecedented sensitivity as one metastatic cell among millions of white blood cells. The time-resolved PA spectral identification of flowing cells was achieved using multicolor labels and laser pulses of different wavelengths and time delays. Multiparameter, noninvasive, portable flow cytometer can be used for preclinical studies on animals with the potential of translation to humans for in vivo PA mapping of colorless lymph vessels and sentinel nodes with simultaneous single cell detection and metastasis assessment without labeling or use of contrast dyes and/or novel low-toxic multicolor probes with different absorption spectra."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",18677768,PMC2606693

As portals of uptake, diffusion and endocytosis were identified resulting in nanoparticle accumulation in endocytotic vesicles, lysosomes, mitochondria and nuclei. Dramatic decrease of lysosomal membrane stability occurred after 12h of exposure. Lysosomal damage was followed by excessive lipofuscin accumulation indicative of severe oxidative stress. Increased phagocytosis by granulocytes, autophagy and finally apoptosis of epithelial cells of gills and primary and secondary digestive tubules epithelial cells indicated progressive cell death. These pathological responses are regarded as general indices of toxic cell injury and oxidative stress.

This study presents an analysis of risk to freshwater ecosystems from silver released from these nanoparticles incorporated into textiles and plastics. The analysis is presented in four stages; (i) silver mass flow analysis and estimation of emissions, (ii) assessment of the fate of silver in a river system and estimation of predicted environmental concentrations (PECs), (iii) critical evaluation of available toxicity data for environmentally relevant forms of silver and estimation of predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs), and (iv) risk characterization. Our assessment is based on estimated silver use in the year 2010, focusing on the Rhine river as a case study. In 2010, biocidal plastics and textiles are predicted to account for up to 15% of the total silver released into water in the European Union. The majority of silver released into wastewater is incorporated into sewage sludge and may be spread on agricultural fields. The amount of silver reaching natural waters depends on the fraction of wastewater that is effectively treated. Modeled PECs in the Rhine river are in satisfactory agreement with monitoring data from other river systems. Because a complete characterization of the toxicity of environmentally relevant silver species is lacking, only a limited risk assessment is possible at this time. However, our study indicates that PEC/PNEC ratios greater than 1 cannot be ruled out for freshwater ecosystems, in particular sediments.

Here, we evaluated the radioprotective effect of the nanoparticle DF-1, a fullerene with antioxidant properties, in zebrafish embryos. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Zebrafish embryos were exposed to different doses of ionizing radiation ranging from 20 to 80 Gy in the presence and absence of DF-1. Toxicity and radioprotective effects were assessed by monitoring overall survival and morphology as well as organ functions by employing assays to measure kidney excretory function and development of sensory nerve cells (neuromasts). Antioxidant properties of DF-1 were assessed in whole fish. RESULTS: DF-1 had no apparent adverse effects on normal zebrafish morphology or viability throughout the concentration range tested (1-1,000 micromol/L). Ionizing radiation (10-40 Gy) caused time-dependent and dose-dependent perturbations of normal zebrafish morphology and physiology, notably defective midline development resulting in dorsal curvature of the body axis (""curly-up""), neurotoxicity, impaired excretory function, and decreased survival of the exposed embryos. DF-1 (100 micromol/L) markedly attenuated overall and organ-specific radiation-induced toxicity when given within 3 hours before or up to 15 minutes after radiation exposure. By contrast, DF-1 afforded no protection when given 30 minutes after ionizing radiation. The degree of radioprotection provided by DF-1 was comparable with that provided by the Food and Drug Administration-approved radioprotector amifostine (4 mmol/L). Protection against radiation-associated toxicity using DF-1 in zebrafish embryos was associated with marked reduction of radiation-induced reactive oxygen species. CONCLUSION: The fullerene DF-1 protects zebrafish embryos against deleterious effects of ionizing radiation due, in part, to its antioxidant properties."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",17145832,

Primary microplastics are plastics originally manufactured to be that size, while secondary microplastics originate from fragmentation. Nanoplastics can originate from engineered material or can be produced during fragmentation of microplastic debris. Microplastics range from 0.1 to 5,000 mu m and nanoplastics from approximately 1 to 100 nm (0.001-0.1 mu m). There is no legislation for microplastics and nanoplastics as contaminants in food. Methods are available for identification and quantification of microplastics in food, including seafood. Occurrence data are limited. In contrast to microplastics no methods or occurrence data in food are available for nanoplastics. Microplastics can contain on average 4% of additives and the plastics can adsorb contaminants. Both additives and contaminants can be of organic as well of inorganic nature. Based on a conservative estimate the presence of microplastics in seafood would have a small effect on the overall exposure to additives or contaminants. Toxicity and toxicokinetic data are lacking for both microplastics and nanoplastics for a human risk assessment. It is recommended that analytical methods should be further developed for microplastics and developed for nanoplastics and standardised, in order to assess their presence, identity and to quantify their amount in food. Furthermore, quality assurance should be in place and demonstrated. For microplastics and nanoplastics, occurrence data in food, including effects of food processing, in particular, for the smaller sized particles (< 150 mu m) should be generated. Research on the toxicokinetics and toxicity, including studies on local effects in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, are needed as is research on the degradation of microplastics and potential formation of nanoplastics in the human GI tract.

First, the combined acute toxicity of PCB-18 and 100 nm PS to Daphnia magna (D. magna) in water was evaluated.

The results showed that a low concentration of the PS could decrease the toxicity to D. magna, which might be originated from the decreased free concentration of PCB-18. However, when the PS concentration was high enough, an opposite effect was observed because the PS dominated the lethality instead of PCB-18.

They may also comprise very harmful chemicals that are implemented in plants and animals when MPs/NPs are used that may lead to higher accumulation of these compounds in food chains. In addition, higher surface area-to-volume ratio, characteristic of MPs/NPs can contribute to their potentially harmful impact as other pollutants, like continuous organic contaminants, can also be bio-accumulated and adsorbed. A complex issue correlated with MPs/NPs is their ability to absorb and interact with other common pollutants in the environment, such as metals, pharmaceuticals, and other contaminants.

The present study aims to elucidate the effects of microplastics on the growth, accumulation and oxidative stress response in the liver of Eriocheir sinensis. Fluorescent microplastic particles (diameter = 0.5 mu m) accumulated in the gill, liver and gut tissues of E. sinensis were investigated when crabs were exposed to a concentration of 40000 mu g/L for 7 days. A 21 day toxicity test suggested that the rate of weight gain, specific growth rate, and hepatosomatic index of E. sinensis decreased with increasing microplastic concentration (0 mu g/L, 40 mu g/L, 400 mu g/L, 4000 mu g/L and 40000 mu g/L). The activities of AChE and GPT in crabs exposed to microplastics were lower than those in control group. GOT activity increased significantly after exposure to a low concentration of microplastics and then decreased continuously with increasing microplastic concentrations. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), aspartate transaminase (GOT), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) increased in specimens exposed to low concentrations of microplastics (40 and 400 mu g/L) compared to the control and decreased in organisms exposed to high concentrations (4000 and 40000 mu g/L). In contrast, the activities of acetylcholinesterase, catalase (CAT), and alanine aminotransferase were significantly lower in the organisms exposed to microplastics compared to control animals. Upon exposure to increasing microplastic concentrations, the expression of genes encoding the antioxidants SOD, CAT, GPx and glutathione S-transferase in the liver decreased after first increasing. Exposure to microplastics increased the expression of the gene encoding p38 in the MAPK signaling pathway and significantly decreased the expressions of genes encoding ERK, AKT, and MEK. The results of this study demonstrate that microplastics can accumulate in the tissues of E. sinensis and negatively affect growth. In addition, exposure to microplastics causes damage and induces oxidative stress in the hepatopancreas of E. sinensis. The findings provide basic biological data for environmental and human risk assessments of microplastics of high concern."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

Nanoplastics can originate from engineered material or can be produced during fragmentation of microplastic debris. This paper presents an analysis of the research available in the literature on the content of microplastics in food, tap water, and bottled water. There is no legislation for microplastics as contaminants in food. Available data are from seafood species such as fish, shrimp, and bivalves, and also in other foods such as honey, beer, and table salt. In tap water, the measured amount of microplastic particles varies extensively and depends on the place of intake, type of conditioning, and water distribution system. Studies concerning bottled water have shown that water contains microplastics from disposable plastic bottles, bottles made of recycled material, and even glass bottles. The lack of analytical standards related to the adoption of the method of determination and identification of the size and form of microplastic particles was found to be problematic. The abovementioned particles were mainly identified as polyethylene ( PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polyamides (PA), polyether sulfone (PES), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride ( PVC), and were between 1 and 150 mu m in size. The most common shapes of the particles were fragments, followed by fibres and flakes. Toxicity and toxicokinetic data are lacking for microplastics for a human risk assessment."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Over the last decade, several methods have been applied and advanced to monitor and quantify microplastics, to identify the polymer material and to describe the particle properties, such as size, shape or colour. In most cases, the overarching aim is to elucidate patterns of occurrence that might result from (micro)plastic emissions and environmental fate. But the applied methods are subject to uncertainties and boundary conditions, be it spatial resolution that excludes the smallest microplastics or limitations in distinguishing microplastic particles from natural particles. This critical review provides an overview of the state-of-the-art procedures in microplastic analysis, gives examples of potential ways ahead and remaining challenges and classifies available methods according to the underlying research question. The resulting decision tree for the selection of analytical methods starts with a common research question and takes specificities of the environmental matrix into account. The procedural range consequently ranges from fast screening methods based on visual identification to a highly sophisticated combination of analytical methods that provide information on polymer type, particle number or mass and eventually particle size but are very time-consuming and expensive. Standardization of microplastic analytical methods on the basis of the research aim will help to make study results comparable and obtain a more comprehensive picture of microplastic abundance and fate in the environment."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Biochemical markers and metabolomics were used to determine whether MPs could enhance the toxicity of OPFRs. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) increased (p < 0.05) by 21% and 26% respectively in 10 mu g/L TDCPP + PE group compared to TDCPP group.

Plastic waste can fragment into smaller debris, some with a diameter < 5 mm (microplastics). Microplastics are of growing concern especially since 2014, however to date research on microplastic pollution has mainly focused on marine environments, partly because it has been mistakenly thought that sewage treatment plants could remove all plastic debris. To understand the impact of microplastic pollution in freshwater environments, an assessment of research on the sources, distribution and effects of microplastics, and trends in their analysis and policy has been carried out. Main sources of microplastic found in freshwater environments include synthetic textiles, personal care products, industrial raw materials and the improper disposal of plastic waste. Microplastic pollution is a global issue that presents with a broad range of concentration: for example, 3.5 x 10<^>(3) microplastic units.L-1 were reported in sediment of Lake Huron, in the US and as low as 1.2x10(-4) units.L-1 in countries with sparse population such as Mongolia. The main polymer constituents of microplastics found in freshwaters have been identified as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), accounting for 70% of the total, each with a very similar frequency of occurrence. Despite microplastics being relatively inert, they are found to cause some effects in aquatic organisms. Future work should focus on monitoring microplastic pollution in regions from where there is currently scarce published data (e.g. South America, Africa and North Asia) and the study of their sources, stability, transport and effects to freshwater ecosystems. The establishment of standardized monitoring methods will allow for the comparison of data from different geographic areas.

Six batches of three seafood species were examined for the presence of microplastics using FTIR spectroscopy. A total of 107 seafood individuals from three species (hard clam Meretrix lusoria, oyster Crassostrea gigas, Loligo squid Loliginidae spp.) weighing a total of 994 g yielded a total of 100 microplastic particles consisting of nine different polymer types.

In light of the potential for microplastic fibers and fragments to be taken up by small marine organisms, we examined plastic ingestion by two foundation species near the base of North Pacific marine food webs, the calanoid copepod Neocalanus cristatus and the euphausiid Euphausia pacifia. We developed an acid digestion method to assess plastic ingestion by individual zooplankton and detected microplastics in both species. Encounter rates resulting from ingestion were 1 particle/every 34 copepods and 1/every 17 euphausiids (euphausiids > copepods; p = 0.01). Consistent with differences in the size selection of food between these two zooplankton species, the ingested particle size was greater in euphausiids (816 +/- A 108 mu m) than in copepods (556 +/- A 149 mu m) (p = 0.014). The contribution of ingested microplastic fibres to total plastic decreased with distance from shore in euphausiids (r (2) = 70, p = 0.003), corresponding to patterns in our previous observations of microplastics in seawater samples from the same locations. This first evidence of microplastic ingestion by marine zooplankton indicate that species at lower trophic levels of the marine food web are mistaking plastic for food, which raises fundamental questions about potential risks to higher trophic level species. One concern is risk to salmon: We estimate that consumption of microplastic-containing zooplankton will lead to the ingestion of 2-7 microplastic particles/day by individual juvenile salmon in coastal British Columbia, and a parts per thousand currency sign91 microplastic particles/day in returning adults."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Materials and methods We analyzed distribution and abundance of microplastics in 100 soils, representing different land use types that include forest, urban (traffic and residence), and agriculture the environs of Yeoju City. Sampling plots were located on a systematic grid with 2.5 km x 2.5km spacing. Topsoil (0-5 cm) was collected with a hand auger and samples were pretreated by drying, density separation using ZnCl(2)solution, organic matter digestion, and decompression filtration. Abundance of microplastics was measured by counting using a digital stereo microscope; microplastics were grouped by shapes (fragment, film, fiber, and sphere) and color (black, red, green, blue, yellow, white, and transparent). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis was used to identify polymer type of the microplastics. Results and discussion Soils of Yeoju contained an average 700 pieces center dot kg(-1)of microplastics, but this greatly varied with land use types. Roadside soils had more microplastics (1108 pieces kg(-1)), mostly black styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) fragments associated with tire dust. Unexpectedly, the largest amount of microplastics was detected not from urban soils but from an upland soil (3440 pieces kg(-1)). The mean abundance of microplastics in agricultural soil was 664 pieces kg(-1), varying with farming types; the highest abundance was at orchard sites, followed by upland, greenhouse, and then paddy field sites. Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) were identified from microplastics sampled at upland, greenhouse, and orchard sites, while SBR-derived microplastics were found more widely in all farmland soils, implicating that mulching film usage and farm machinery. Conclusions Soil microplastic contamination is significant and widespread in urban and agricultural soils of Yeoju, but differs in form and distribution, according to the locality of traffic and farming. Atmospheric fallout to forest soils is quantified and found to be significantly impacted by microplastics. The use of mulching film as a source of PE and PP presents particular concern in terms of the effects of microplastic contamination on soil quality, health, and functionality in agroecosystems."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

A growing body of literature describes the occurrence and effects of microplastics in commercial species, primarily from Europe, Asia, and South America; however, there are far fewer studies conducted in North America. In this article, we review the evidence available for the presence and effects of microplastics on commercially valuable fishery species of North America and possible consequences of human consumption. We identify key priorities for future research on this topic including geographic and taxonomic representativeness; physiological, organismal, and population level effects; microplastics as multiple stressors; human health risks; and standardization of field and lab protocols.        Commercial fisheries yield essential foods, sustain cultural practices, and provide widespread employment around the globe. Commercially harvested species face a myriad of anthropogenic threats including degraded habitats, changing climate, overharvest, and pollution. Microplastics are pollutants of increasing concern, which are pervasive in the environment and can harbor or adsorb pollutants from surrounding waters. Aquatic organisms, including commercial species, encounter and ingest microplastics, but there is a paucity of data about those caught and cultured in North America. Additional research is needed to determine prevalence, physiological effects, and population-level implications of microplastics in commercial species from Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Investigations into possible human health effects of microplastic exposure from seafood are also greatly needed. This synthesis summarizes current knowledge, identifies data gaps, and provides future research directions for addressing microplastics effects in commercially valuable North American fishery species."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Much of this is not recycled and is disposed into the natural environment, has a long environmental residence time and accumulates in sedimentary systems worldwide, posing a threat to important ecosystems and potentially human health. We synthesize existing knowledge of seafloor microplastic distribution, and integrate this with process-based sedimentological models of particle transport, to provide new insights, and critically, to identify future research challenges. Compilation of published data shows that microplastics pervade the global seafloor, from abyssal plains to submarine canyons and deep-sea trenches (where they are most concentrated). However, few studies relate microplastic accumulation to sediment transport and deposition. Microplastics may enter directly into the sea as marine litter from shipping and fishing, or indirectly via fluvial and aeolian systems from terrestrial environments. The nature of the entry-point is critical to how terrestrially sourced microplastics are transferred to offshore sedimentary systems. We present models for physiographic shelf connection types related to the tectono-sedimentary regime of the margin. Beyond the shelf, the principal agents for microplastic transport are: (i) gravity-driven transport in sediment-laden flows; (ii) settling, or conveyance through biological processes, of material that was formerly floating on the surface or suspended in the water column; (iii) transport by thermohaline currents, either during settling or by reworking of deposited microplastics. We compare microplastic settling velocities to natural sediments to understand how appropriate existing sediment transport models are for explaining microplastic dispersal. Based on this analysis, and the relatively well-known behavior of deep-marine flow types, we explore the expected distribution of microplastic particles, both in individual sedimentary event deposits and within deep-marine depositional systems. Residence time within certain deposit types and depositional environments is anticipated to be variable, which has implications for the likelihood of ingestion and incorporation into the food chain, further transport, or deeper burial. We conclude that the integration of process-based sedimentological and stratigraphic knowledge with insights from modern sedimentary systems, and biological activity within them, will provide essential constraints on the transfer of microplastics to deep-marine environments, their distribution and ultimate fate, and the implications that these have for benthic ecosystems. The dispersal of anthropogenic across the sedimentary systems that cover Earth's surface has important societal and economic implications. Sedimentologists have a key, but as-yet underplayed, role in addressing, and mitigating this globally significant issue."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

It is also important to understand the microplastics' uptake and their potential risks to freshwater species. The Australian glass shrimp Paratya australiensis (Family: Atyidae) is commonly found in fresh waterbodies in eastern Australia, and are sensitive to anthropogenic stressors but have a wide tolerance range to the natural environmental conditions. This study aimed to understand the microplastics' occurrence and types in water samples and the shrimp P. australiensis, and identify if the shrimp could be a suitable bioindicator for microplastic pollution. Surface water and P. australiensis across ten urban and rural freshwater sites in Victoria were sampled. In total, 30 water samples and 100 shrimp were analysed for microplastic content, and shrimp body weights and sizes were also recorded. Microplastics were picked, photographed and identified using FT-IR microscopy: in water samples, 57.9% of items including suspect items were selected to identify; all microplastics found in shrimp samples were identified. Microplastics were present in the surface waters of all sites, with an average abundance of 0.40 +/- 0.27 items/L. A total of 36% of shrimp contained microplastics with an average of 0.52 +/- 0.55 items/ind (24 +/- 31 items/g). Fibre was the most common shape, and blue was the most frequent colour in both water and shrimp samples. The dominant plastic types were polyester in water samples, and rayon in shrimp samples. Even though results from this study show a relatively low concentration of microplastics in water samples in comparison with global studies, it is worth noticing that microplastics were regularly detected in fresh waterbodies in Victoria, Australia. Compared with water samples, shrimp contained a wider variety of plastic types, suggesting they may potentially behave as passive samplers of microplastics pollution in freshwater environments.

In a laboratory bioassay, T. chuii cultures were exposed for 96 h to similar to 5 nm diameter gold nanoparticles (AuNP) and to virgin 1-5 mu m diameter microplastics (MP), alone and in mixture. The treatments were: control; citrate-control; AuNP alone (0.1, 0.3 and 3 mg/L); MP alone (0.3, 0.9 and 4 mg/L) and mixture of the two substances in three different concentrations (0.1 mg/L AuNP + 0.3 mg/L MP; 0.3 mg/L AuNP + 0.9 mg/L MP; 3 mg/l AuNP + 4 mg/L MP). The effect criterion was the inhibition of the average specific growth rate. AuNP alone and MP alone did not cause significant decrease of T. chui average specific growth rate up to 3 mg/L and 4 mg/L, respectively. The mixture containing 3 mg/L AuNP + 4 mg/L MP significantly reduced the average specific growth rate of the microalgae. Therefore, this mixture was more toxic to T. chuii than its components individually. Overall, the results of the present study indicated that the MP and AuNP tested have a relatively low toxicity to T. chuii, but the toxicity increases when they are in mixtures containing high concentrations of both substances.

It remains unclear whether and how the consumption of aquatic products contaminated with microplastics affect human health. Therefore, it is advised that future research should focus on the transfer, accumulation, and effects of microplastics in the food chain. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a growing number of investigations on the abundance and distribution of microplastics in different water bodies and biota worldwide, with relatively few studies conducted in Latin America, however, the current knowledge of microplastics sources, occurrence, transport, fate and potential impacts remains largely unexplored. This review presents the current trends and advances of microplastics on a lesser known region of the world by compiling the research performed to date in different environmental compartments. The sampling techniques and methods for microplastics extraction in the existing literature data are also summarized. Among 78 published studies reviewed, 34% of studies were from Brazil and 46% of studies have mainly focused on biota. The main findings showed that micro plastics are not negligible across Latin America significantly varying in their distribution, with the prevalence of fibers comprising 62% of the total. Polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene have been identified as the most common polymer types, accounting for 80% of the total. Limited studies and lack of standardized methodologies render difficulties to establish fundamental information on microplastics abundance and types in most countries of this region. Therefore, this review will primarily serve as a baseline when evaluating the environmental relevance of microplastics in Latin America and would stimulate discussions focusing on this topic, calling for more research in future.

Eight common polymer types were used to assess the influence of reagent exposure on particle integrity. Organic matter removal efficiencies were established for test sludge and soil samples. Fenton's reagent was identified as the optimum protocol. All other methods showed signs of particle degradation or resulted in an insufficient reduction in organic matter content. A further validation procedure revealed high microplastic extraction efficiencies for particles with different morphologies. This confirmed the suitability of Fenton's reagent for use in conjunction with density separation for extracting microplastics. This approach affords greater comparability with existing studies that utilize a density-based technique. Recommendations for further method optimization were also identified to improve the recovery of microplastic from complex, organic-rich environmental samples."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Existing scientific evidence shows that microplastics exposure triggers a wide variety of toxic insult from feeding disruption to reproductive performance, physical ingestion, disturbances in energy metabolism, changes in liver physiology, synergistic and/or antagonistic action of other hydrophobic organic contaminants etc. from lower to higher trophics. Thus, microplastic accumulation and its associated adverse effects make it mandatory to go in for risk assessment and legislative action.

Nevertheless, the effects of chronic exposure to nanoplastics remain largely unclear in nematodes. In this study, we employed C. elegans as an animal model to determine the effects of nanopolystyrene (30 nm) exposure from adult day-1 for 8-day. After the exposure, only 1000 mu g/L nanopolystyrene reduced the lifespan. In contrast, nanopolystyrene >= 1 mu g/L decreased locomotion behavior and activated oxidative stress. Meanwhile, in 10 mu g/L nanopolystyrene exposed nematodes, both expression of SOD-3, a Mn-SOD, and autophagy induction as indicated by LGG-1:GFP expression were significantly increased. RNAi knockdown of daf-2 encoding an insulin receptor enhanced the autophagy induction, and RNAi knockdown of daf-16 encoding a FOXO transcriptional factor in insulin signaling pathway suppressed the autophagy induction in 10 mu g/L nanopolystyrene exposed nematodes. Moreover, DAF-16 acted upstream of LGG-1, an ortholog of Atg8/LC3, to regulate the toxicity of nanopolystyrene toxicity in inducing ROS production and in decreasing locomotion behavior at adult day-9.

This article reviews the progress of microplastics research in the Yellow Sea in China, including studies on surface water, the seawater column, sediments, and marine organisms. The results indicate that plastic debris exists throughout the west Yellow Sea, with higher abundance of microplastics in water columns and sediments in the north part than those in the south part. Fibers <1 mm and transparent-colored particles dominated the samples collected. Polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and cellophane (CP) were the dominant debris types. The wide distribution of microplastics in the environment also results in animal ingestion. Sea cucumbers, accordingly, ingest more microplastic debris than other biologic taxa (zooplankton, shellfish, and fish) that have a bearing on their surrounding environment. By providing basic environmental assessment data regarding the Yellow Sea, this paper demonstrates that actions should be taken to reduce the consumption and emission of plastics into the environment."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

This review summarizes studies between 1999 and 2020 in relation to microplastics in aquatic ecosystems and human food products, their potential toxic effects as elicited in animal studies, and policies on their use and disposal. There is a paucity of information on the toxicity mechanisms of microplastics in animal studies, and despite their documented presence in food products, no policy has been in place so far, to monitor and regulates microplastics in commercial foods meant for human consumption. Although there are policies and regulations with respect to plastics, these are only in a few countries and in most instances are not fully implemented due to socioeconomic reasons, so they do not address the problem across the entire life cycle of plastics from production to disposal. More animal research to elucidate pathways and early biomarkers of microplastic toxicity that can easily be detected in humans is needed.

This diversity, as well as their microscopic size range, presents numerous barriers to identification and enumeration. These issues are addressed with the application of physical and chemical analytical procedures; however, these present new problems associated with researcher training, facility availability and cost, especially for large-scale monitoring programs. Perhaps more importantly, the classifications and nomenclature used by individual researchers to describe microplastics remains inconsistent. In addition to reducing comparability between studies, this limits the conclusions that may be drawn regarding plastic sources and potential environmental impacts. Additionally, where particle morphology data is presented, it is often separate from information on polymer distribution. In establishing a more rigorous and standardized visual identification procedure, it is possible to improve the targeting of complex analytical techniques and improve the standards by which we monitor and record microplastic contamination. Here we present a simple and effective protocol to enable consistent visual processing of samples with an aim to contribute to a higher degree of standardization within the microplastic scientific community. This protocol will not eliminate the need for non-subjective methods to verify plastic objects, but it will standardize the criteria by which suspected plastic items are identified and reduce the costs associated with further analysis."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Although wild animals might be contaminated with microbeads and/or other pharmaceuticals, data regarding the long-term effects remain limited. To clearly elucidate the effects of microbeads, studies of long-term exposure using animal models are necessary. Our aim was to elucidate the effects of microbeads alone on the growth and fecundity of medaka following long-term exposure (12 weeks). In experiment 1, fish groups (except controls) were temporarily exposed to polyethylene microbeads (10-63 mu m diameter) a low dose of 0.065 microbeads-mg/L and high dose of 0.65 microbeads-mg/L. In experiment 2, see-through medaka and fluorescent polyethylene microbeads (10 -45 mu m diameter) were used to estimate the retention time of ingested microbeads in the digestive tract, which was 4-9 days. The low dose of microbeads did not affect growth but did decrease the number of eggs and the hatching rate. The high dose decreased growth, the number of eggs, and hatching rate. Growth differences were recognized for the first time at 7 weeks, and differences in the number of eggs at 12 weeks. Thus, long-term tests using medaka indicated that microbeads per se exhibit growth inhibition and reproductive toxicity. These effects could be associated with nutritional factors resulting from the long retention time of microbeads in the digestive tract. We also determined the dose that affects only fecundity. This suggests that normal growth of medaka in the wild does not mean the environment is free from microbead contamination. We are thus attempting to identify new biological indexes for monitoring the status of microbead contamination using our system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Marine fauna subject to MPs exposure from various environmental sources are most likely to have detrimental effects on their immune system. However, studies of potential risks of MPs on marine ecosystems in light of environmental concentrations are largely limited. To this end, we presented an approach for assessing potential impact of MPs on marine ecosystems based on marine mussel Mytilus-based probabilistic risk assessment framework. The immunotoxic-based biomarkers of Mytilus were used to assess the impact of MPs on marine environment appraised with datasets by compiling oceanic region-specific and comprehensive MPs-environment studies along with published toxicity experiments. The immunological effects of MPs on lysosomal destabilization and phagocytosis in hemocytes of Mytilus were reconstructed as the concentration-response functions. We assessed the risk for marine environment exceeding a threshold of Mytilus-based immunological toxicity based on the benchmark concentration (BMC) approach corresponding to a 10% inhibition effect (BMC10). We estimated BMC10 values for inhibitions of lysosomal membrane stability and phagocytosis to be 1.4 and 0.4 mg L-1, respectively. Here we showed that the overall MPs-associated impact potential was low among South Pacific Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and South Atlantic Ocean. However, we found that MPs from North Pacific Ocean were very likely (> 90% probability) to pose a potential threat to marine mussels. Our findings have important implications for understanding the linked relationships between environmental MPs and likelihood of exposure risk for marine organisms in different oceanic regions around the world. We suggest that Mytilus-based risk indicator for estimating risk metrics of essential marine ecosystems posed by environmentally relevant MPs concentrations can help inform practices for the sustainable management and for mitigating the environmental MPs-induced negative impact on marine organisms."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",,

Our results showed that these original commercial products exhibited obvious physical (e.g., color) and chemical (e.g., spectra) changes after UV weathering and agent (H2O2 and KOH) digestion treatments. The changes of 4 characteristic bands (1735, 1425/1419, 1105, 1060-1053/1030-1027 cm(-1)) were evaluated.

The mixture of semi-synthetic and natural fibers from the real field samples was also easily distinguished using the characteristic band at 1105 cm(-1). Our results suggest that the characteristic band at 1105 cm(-1) could be an ideal reference to distinguish natural and semi-synthetic fibers in field microplastic investigations.

The more severe activation of oxidative stress and suppression of SOD-3:GFP expression and mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mt UPR) were associated with this observed toxicity enhancement induced by nanopolystyrene exposure. Moreover, the more severe C. albicans colony formation and suppression of innate immune response as indicated by the alteration in expression of anti-microbial genes (abf-2, cnc-4, cnc-7, and fipr-22/23) further contributed to the formation of this toxicity enhancement induced by nanopolystyrene exposure.

While adverse health effects induced by bisphenol A and its analogues on marine animals are well documented in the literature, the endocrine potential of bisphenolic compounds on human health remains elusive. We applied next generation sequencing (NGS) with the estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) positive human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 treated with 17-beta-estradiol (E2), bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol B (BPB), bisphenol Z (BPZ) and tetramethyl bisphenol A (4MeBPA). We used molecular docking, microscale thermophoresis, ER alpha activation assay, and cell cycle experiments on MCF-7 and ER alpha overexpressing HEK293 cells to verify the impact of the compounds on ER alpha. 14 genes were found upregulated (ADORA1, DDIT4, CELSR2, FOSL2, JUN, HSPA13, IER3, IGF1R, PGR, RUNX2, SLC7A11, SLC7A2, SLC7A5, STC2) and 3 genes were downregulated (BCAS3, PHF19, PRKCD) in almost all samples. These genes are associated with cell growth, invasion, migration, apoptosis and cancer development. We further confirmed the binding, activation and proliferative effect of BPA, BPB, BPZ, and 4MeBPA on ER alpha.

C. and Abrantes, N.",,,,,"The accumulation of plastics in aquatic systems constitutes an emerging scientific and societal concern, because of their ubiquity, high persistence and insufficient management by sewage and wastewater treatment processes. Microplastics (< 5 mm), a group of particles differing in physico-chemical properties (e.g. size, shape, colour, density and polymer type), are of particular concern as they can reach high densities and can interact with biotic and abiotic environment. Moreover, potential of bioaccumulation increases with decreasing of particle size. Although microplastics have been widely investigated in marine systems, very little attention is paid to freshwater systems. As the concern about microplastics started appearing recently, there is no unified method for microplastic isolation, which result in inconsistent data that differs in quality and resolution. Hence, this work aims to assess the effectiveness of distinct isolation methods as an attempt to identify and establish a unified method for environmental monitoring of aquatic systems. For that, artificial samples containing eleven plastics belonging to the most common types of polymers (e.g. low/high-density polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate) were prepared and subjected to different methods, including density separation methods using sugar, olive oil and zinc chloride, as well as organic matter degradation methods with hydrogen peroxide (wet peroxide oxidation) and multienzymatic detergent (enzymatic digestion). The samples then underwent the detection, quantification, and identification of polymers using a stereomicroscope and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Several criteria were considered in order to achieve the aims of this work: efficiency of density separation and organic matter degradation, the total mass of recovered polymers, cost of each procedure, the time spent with each method, the simplicity, and the quality of recovered polymers. Based on this multi-criteria approach, this study concludes that the wet peroxide oxidation with addition of zinc chloride was the most effective method."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Concerns over the effects of plastic polymers in marine ecosystems is reflected in the high number of toxicological studies, regarding microplastics (<5 mm) and marine fauna. Although several studies reported that organisms ingest and subsequently eliminate microplastics (MP), the potential effects at organ and tissue level remain unclear, especially considering exposure to different microplastic sizes and concentrations. The present study aimed at investigating potential pathophysiological effects of the ingestion of MP by marine filter-feeders. For the purpose, Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) was exposed to spherical polystyrene MP (2 and 10 pm 0) over short- and medium-term exposure periods, under single and combined concentrations that represent high, yet realistic doses (10 and 1000 MP mL(-1)). Overall, results suggest rapid MP' clearance from water column by filtering, regardless of MP size. Ingestion occurred, identified by MP in the lumen of the gut (mostly in midgut region), followed by excretion through faeces. However, no MP were found in gills or digestive gland diverticula. Biochemical indicators for oxidative stress were generally irresponsive regardless of organ and time of exposure. Small foci of haemocytic infiltration in gastric epithelia were found, albeit not clearly related to MP ingestion. Globally, no evident histopathological damage was recorded in whole-body sections of exposed animals. The present findings highlight the adaptative ability of filter-feeding bivalves to cope with filtration of suspended MP, resulting in rapid elimination and reduced internal damage following ingestion of spherical MP. Nevertheless, the fact that the animals are able to translocate MP to the gut reveals that filter feeding organisms may indeed became a target of concern for fragmented materials with smaller, mixed sizes and sharper edges.

Because of properties such as buoyancy and extreme durability, synthetic polymers are present in rivers, lakes, and oceans and accumulate in sediments all over the world. However, freshwater sediments have attracted less attention than the investigation of sediments in marine ecosystems. For this reason, river shore sediments of the rivers Rhine and Main in the Rhine-Main area in Germany were analyzed. The sample locations comprised shore sediment of a large European river (Rhine) and a river characterized by industrial influence (Main) in areas with varying population sizes as well as sites in proximity to nature reserves. All sediments analyzed contained microplastic particles (<5 mm) with mass fractions of up to 1 g kg(-1) or 4000 particles kg(-1). Analysis of the plastics by infrared spectroscopy showed a large abundance of polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene, which covered more than 75% of all polymer types identified in the sediment. Short distance transport of plastic particles from the tributary to the main stream could be confirmed by the identification of pellets, which were separated from shore sediment samples of both rivers. This systematic study shows the emerging pollution of inland river sediments with microplastics and, as a consequence thereof, underlines the importance of rivers as vectors of transport of microplastics into the ocean."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Weaker peak intensities were detected for small particles compared to large particles, and the reflectances were weaker at longer wavelengths when the particles were measured on a wet filter. These phenomena are explainable due to the effect of the correlation between the particle size and the absorption of infrared light by water. We constructed robust classification models that are capable of classifying polymer types, regardless of particle size or filter conditions (wet vs. dry), based on hyperspectral data for small particles measured on wet filters. Using the models, we also successfully classified the polymer type of polystyrene beads covered with microalgae, which simulates the natural conditions of microplastics in the ocean. This study suggests that hyperspectral imaging techniques with appropriate classification models allow the identification of microplastics without the time- and labor-consuming procedures of drying samples and removing biofilms, thus enabling more rapid analyses."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

This study investigated the bleaching and necrosis extent of A. formosa caused by LDPE contamination via laboratory assay. The staghorn coral ingested the microplastics, resulting in bleaching and necrosis that concomitantly occurred with the release of zooxanthellae. P100-A experimentation was the worst case, showing bleaching by day 2 (10.8 +/- 2.2%) and continued bleaching to 93.6% +/- 2.0 by day 14 followed by 5.9 +/- 2.5% necrosis. The overall results confirmed that the LDPE concentration impacts coral health. We highlighted that microplastics have been ingested and partially egested. Their presence showed either a direct or indirect impact on coral polyps via direct interaction or through photosynthesis perturbation due to microplastics that cover the coral surface.

All the sediments were found to contain mesoplastics (>5 mm) and microplastics (<5 mm) particles with varying degree of the mass fraction (11.48 to 63.79 ng/g sediments), numerical abundance (99.27-409.86 items/kg) and morphotypes. Analysis of the mesoplastics with FT-IR revealed polyethylene terepthalate (39%) as the major contributing plastic debris in the sediments followed by polyethylene (30%).

Microplastics (MP), in particular, can pose risks reaching humans through the food web via various marine organisms. Among these organisms, since they are consumed as a whole, mussels are vital vectors of MP transfer during human consumption. Hence, here we analyzed MP pollution in Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) sampled from 23 different locations all along the Turkish coasts of the Black Sea, Sea of Marmara, and the Aegean Sea. After digestion of the mussels with H2O2, the micro-particles were determined under a stereomicroscope and characterized by confirming with FTIR analyses. 48% of the sampled mussels were found to have MPs. The average MP abundance was 0.69 item/mussel and 0.23 item/g fresh weight (fw) of soft tissue. Morphology was ordered as follows: fragments (67.6%)> fibers (28.4%)> films (4.05%). The dominant size of MPs was detected less than 0.5 mm (26.58%). 12 different polymers have been identified by FTIR and PET (32.9%), PP (28.4%), and PE (19.4%) were found to constitute 80% of the total MPs. The annual average exposure amount for mussel consumers in Turkey was estimated as 1918 MPs item/per year. Even though international organizations such as FAO, JECFA, or EU have not declared permissible limits, our data may inform human health uptake of MP ingestion via mussels. This data might also serve as a reference data-set for further MP monitoring research in Turkish and European Seas. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

It is toxic to aquatic organisms and can spread through the food chain to ultimately pose a threat to humans. In the environment, MP can interact with microbes and act as a microbial habitat.

We observed that oral exposure to 1000 mu g/L of 0.5 and 50 mu m polystyrene MP decreased the body, liver and lipid weights in mice. Mucus secretion in the gut decreased in both sizes of polystyrene MP-treated groups. Regarding the gut microbiota, at the phylum level, polystyrene MP exposure decreased the relative abundances of Firmicutes and alpha-Proteobacteria in the feces. Furthermore, high throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene revealed significant changes in the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota in the cecums of polystyrene MP-treated mice. At the genus level, a total of 6 and 8 types of bacteria changed in the 0.5 and 50 mu m polystyrene MP-treated groups, respectively. Furthermore, an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) analysis identified that 310 and 160 gut microbes were changed in the 0.5 and 50 mu m polystyrene MP-treated groups, respectively. In addition, the hepatic triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TCH) levels decreased in both 1000 mu g/L 0.5 and 50 mu m polystyrene MP-treated groups. Correspondingly, the relative mRNA levels of some key genes related to lipogenesis and TG synthesis decreased in the liver and epididymal fat. These results indicated that polystyrene MP could modify the gut microbiota composition and induce hepatic lipid disorder in mice; while the mouse is a common mammal model, consequently, the health risks of MP to animals should not be ignored.

However, these mechanisms are highly dependent on buffer conditions or require hybridization with another DNA strand. Herein, we report a new mechanism based on Her-induced cleavage of phosphorothioate (PS) modified RNA. Among the various metal ions tested, Hg2+ induced the most significant cleavage (similar to 16%), while other metals cleaved less than 2% of the same substrate. The undeaved substrate undergoes desulfurization in the presence of He. This cleavage reaction yields a similar amount of product from pH 3.5 to 7 and in the temperature range between 20 and 90 degrees C. Various PS RNA junctions can be cleaved with a similar efficiency, but PS DNA junctions cannot be deaved. A molecular beacon containing three PS RNA modifications is designed, detecting Hg2+ down to 1.7 nM with excellent selectivity.

To better quantify global plastic pollution transport and effectively reduce the sources and risks imposed, a clear understanding of the origin, transport, fate, and effects of riverine plastic debris is important. In this review paper, we discuss the current state of knowledge of plastic pollution in aquatic systems in Bangladesh and evaluate existing research gaps. Bangladesh has been recognized as an internationally significant nation in the plastic pollution crisis, but this paper identifies a major disconnect in knowledge, understanding and capacity to understand and address this critical environmental and public health issue. Here, we review all available scientific publications on plastic pollution in the freshwater and marine environment in Bangladesh and identify key research themes. A total of 24 studies relevant to plastic pollution were published from 2006 to 2019, of which 18 were selected for this study under the authors' criteria. Nine focused on plastic pollution in the marine environment, eight focused on plastic waste generation and management and only one focused on the freshwater environment. We compared our findings with three other countries in the Global South with comparable per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and mismanaged waste, namely Cambodia, Kenya, and Tanzania, revealing similar knowledge gaps. This lack of research demonstrates a need for further work to monitor and model riverine plastic transport and examine the implications for aquatic organisms. This will facilitate the formulation of national management strategies aimed at addressing plastic pollution. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Occurring at the land-sea interface, estuarine habitats such as mangroves are at risk of plastic pollution. This study compared MP pollution (level, morphotype, polymer composition, size and colour) across four South African estuaries, in relation to the built and natural environment. Mouth status, surrounding human population densities and land-use practices influenced the level and type of MP pollution. Systems that were most at risk were predominantly open estuaries surrounded by high population densities and diverse land use types. Microplastic levels and the diversity of types detected increased with increasing levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Overall, microfibres dominated in estuarine water (69%) and mangrove sediment (51%). Polyethylene (43%) and polypropylene (23%) were the dominant polymers overall. Weathered fishing gear, weathered packaging items and run-off from urban/industrial centres are probable sources of MP pollution. Increased run-off and river input during the wet/rainy season may explain the markedly higher MP loads in estuarine waters relative to the dry season. By contrast, MP deposition in mangrove sediment was higher during the dry season. Sediment MP abundance was significantly positively correlated with both pneumatophore density and sediment size (500-2000 mu m). This study highlights the role of mangroves as MP sinks, which may limit movement of MPs into adjacent environments. However, under conditions such as flooding and extreme wave action, mangroves may shift from sinks to sources of plastic pollution."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

MPs were found in all the investigated individuals with an average of about 17 MPs/individual. Fragments were predominant over fibers with a ratio of about 3:1. The majority of MPs were in the dimensional range 50-100 mm. The predominant polymers were polyester, polyamide 6, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene, which together constitute about 61% of all the MPs found. Frag-ments were more concentrated in the hepatopancreas, with no significant difference between gut and tail, while fibers were more concentrated in the gut than in the tail with hepatopancreas somehow in between. The dimensional class of the MPs influences their anatomical distribution. There were no statistical differences among individuals from the two sampling sites.

The release of Me-ENPs has been demonstrated from some products, and thus, particles are likely to enter the aquatic environment where they have been shown to be taken up by a variety of species. Therefore, there is a possibility that Me-ENPs will enter and pass through aquatic food webs, but research on this topic is limited. In this tutorial review, we discuss the factors contributing to trophic transfer of Me-ENPs, and where this information is scarce, we utilize the existing literature on aqueous metal trophic transfer as a potential starting point for greater mechanistic insight and for setting directions for future studies. We identify four key factors affecting trophic transfer of Me-ENPs: (1) environmental transformations of Me-ENPs, (2) uptake and accumulation in prey organisms, (3) internal fate and localization in the prey, and (4) digestive physiology of the predator. Whilst much research has been conducted on the first two of these factors, key knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of how Me-ENP trophic transfer is affected by the internal distribution in prey organisms and the digestive physiology of the predator. Additionally, we suggest that the ENP association with sediments may be a key process that results in the transfer of intact particles within aquatic food webs."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

After density separation in saline solution, MPs were counted by a stereomicroscope. The number of MPs was at the range of 3-18 items/g sediment (3000-18,000 items/kg dry sediment) and the most contaminated site was of Menzel Abderrahmane (MA) followed by Carrier Bay (CB), Menzel Jemil (MJ) and Channel of Bizerte (C). The MPs gathered during the survey varied in size from 0.3 to 5 mm, and appear in a variety of shapes and colours. The dominant shape was fibre (88.88% in MA, 91.00% in CB, 82.35% in C and 21.05% in MJ). The rest of MPs are fragments whilst no micro beads were found. Colours are clear, white, blue, green, red and black. Cities discharges, fishing activity and industrial production sites are the most likely sources of MPs. This first work provides original data on the presence of MPs that determines their bioavailability to organisms as seafood, and then possibly transfers of to human. The high MP concentrations registered in the complex lagoon-channel of Bizerte suggest that this site is a hotspot for MP pollution and there is an urgency to understand their origins and effects on marine life.

We tested the widely used methods for MPs extraction from water and sediment to six agriculture surface soils and three sewage sludges from municipal wastewater treatment plants and included an additional pre-digestion procedure with 30% H2O2 before floatation to remove soil or sludge organic matter (OM). Extraction efficiency of MPs were evaluated under different separation conditions, including floatation solution (NaCl, ZnCl2, and Nal), filtration membrane, and oxidation solution. Results showed that H2O2 pre-digestion significantly increased MPs extraction in soil and sludge, especially the samples with high OM contents, particularly sludge. Floatation solution with higher densities recovered more MPs. The extra released MPs were mainly small fibrous MPs, probably because they are easily retained by aggregates. Our results provide an feasible separation method for MPs in soil and sludge, i.e., pre-digestion with 30% H2O2 at 70 degrees C, floatation with Nal solution, filtration through nylon membrane, and further oxidation with 30% H2O2 + H2SO4 or 30% H2O2 at 70 degrees C. About 420-1290 MP items/kg soil were detected in soil samples, while much higher numbers (5553-13460 MP items/kg) were found in sludge samples. The dominate morphology of MPs was white fiber with a size of 0.02-0.25 mm, while the main types of MPs, identified by a micro-Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (mu-FTIR), were polyethylene and polypropylene in soil samples and polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polyacrylonitrile in sludge samples.

In the marine ecosystem, zooplankton are an important link between phytoplankton and higher trophic levels in the marine food web. Among them, copepods and gelatinous species have been recently reported to ingest MPs, but no potential MP transfer has been verified yet. In this study, a simplified two-level trophic chain - formed by nauplii of theTigriopus fulvuscopepod as prey, and the ephyrae stage ofAurelia sp.as predator - was selected to investigate MP trophic transfer. The experimental setup consisted in feeding ephyrae with nauplii previously exposed to fluorescent 1-5 mu m polyethylene MPs and evaluating two ecotoxicological end-points: jellyfish immobility and pulsation frequency. After 24 h, the jellyfish ingested nauplii contaminated with MPs; however, neither immobility nor behavior was affected by MP transfer. These findings show that MPs can be transported at different trophic levels, but more research is needed to identify their potential effects on the marine food web."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Water samples were collected in the lake and its principal affluent, an irrigation channel, from winter 2018 to summer 2019 with a zooplankton net (47 mu m). MPs were present in all analyzed samples, with a dominance of fibers, black color, and <= 1000 mu m range size. MPs concentration was maximum during summer at the lake (180 MPs m(-3)) while during spring (140 MPs m(-3)) at the channel. Rotifers and cyclopoids dominated the zooplanktonic fraction at both sites which range sizes (< 200 to 600 mu m) included most of the size range found for MPs (50-950 mu m). According to our results, the MPs found represents a potential risk for the first levels of the food web. In the lake, the concentration of MPs concerning total zooplankton abundance was higher when the channel was closed. Nevertheless, when the channel was open, the higher concentration in summer matches with the increase of tourism and an extraordinary rainfall. Our results suggest that while the runoff of agro-industrial waste regulates the MPs concentration in the channel, its water management, the touristic activities, and the runoff of MPs from nearby urban settlements regulate the concentration of MPs in the lake. These findings emphasize the need for better treatment of urban and agro-industrial waste that develops near continental aquatic systems, mainly in those where tourism activities are frequent and treatment facilities scarce."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Although some plastic items derive from offshore sources (mainly fishing and other maritime activities, but also long-distance transport), the importance of local, land-based sources is indicated by the composition of beach debris and the concentration of macro-, meso- and microplastics close to urban source areas. Some 60-90% of plastic from land-based sources is expected to strand on beaches, but plastic standing stocks on beaches are much lower than global model predictions of land-based pollution. Burial in beaches and transport into backshore vegetation are significant sinks, although this plastic is likely to be released as the climate crisis leads to rising sea levels and more extreme storms. Most buried items are fairly small, while many larger items, which account for most of the mass of plastic, are removed from beaches by cleaning efforts. However, even daily accumulation rate estimates - which exclude the effects of cleaning - fall well short of model predictions of plastic leakage from land-based sources. Oceanographic models predict that plastics entering the sea from South Africa are exported to the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, with the proportion depending on source location and item density. At sea, floating macroplastic is concentrated close to urban centres. Farther offshore, plastic items tend to be large and buoyant because biofouling causes small, low buoyancy items to sink. Size-selective removal of plastics by biota might also contribute to the paucity of floating microplastics (<1 mm). The seabed is likely to be the main long-term sink for waste plastics, but the limited data available indicate low levels of plastics on the seabed off South Africa. Only a small proportion of plastic predicted to leak into the sea from South Africa can be accounted for. However, this should not delay the implementation of effective mitigation measures to limit plastic leakage.        Significance:        High densities of waste plastic around urban centres indicate that most macro- and microplastics come from local, land-based sources and do not disperse far at sea.        Beach clean-ups remove up to 90% of the mass of stranded plastic, largely found in macroplastic items (>25 mm).        The seabed is a long-term sink for marine plastics, but densities of plastic on the seabed around South Africa are still modest.        The global model prediction of plastic leakage from South Africa into the sea probably is a gross overestimate."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

This window can be utilized to reduce the background noise, and thus enhance visualization of contrast agents. Exogenous contrast agents have been investigated and co-applied with photoacoustic imaging such as organic materials (indocyanine green, astaxanthin, Prussian blue) and inorganic materials (gold nanorods, gold nanostars). However, these available contrast agents are usually associated with low thermal stability or large size, leading to unreliable photoacoustic signal. Conventional gold nanoparticles have an absorption peak of 520 nm, which corresponds to the absorption spectrum of hemoglobin. This study investigated the synthesis of novel ultrapure, biocompatible, and photostable chain-like gold nanoparticles (CGNPs), which shift the peak absorbance of GNPs from visible window (520 nm) to NIR window, while keeping the GNPs at a smaller size. These GNPs were fabricated by a femtosecond laser and were combined together with two organic polymers. The surface was then modified with PEG and conjugated with RGD ligands. The capacity of CGNPs for photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) and OCT were examined on 4 white New Zealand rabbits using a choroidal neovascularization (CNV) model. CNV was created by laser-induced retinal vein occlusion. Then, all animals were administered GNPs at concentration of 5 mg/mL. PAM and OCT were obtained before and after the injection at various time points, including 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24 h, days 2, 3, 5, 7, 9. 11, and 14. In vivo PAM and OCT imaging demonstrated that CNV was observed after the injection of CGNPs. In comparison with the signal before the injection, CGNPs produces 18fold greater photoacoustic contrast and exhibits a 176 % increase in OCT signal, given the reduced background signal in the NIR window. The newly fabricated CGNPs have the capacity to improve visualization in living animals, while minimizing signal from hemoglobin and other endogenous contrast agents."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",,

The occurrence of MP in Malaysia is also unknown. Thus, the present study has characterised the abundance of MP between Skudai and Tebrau River. The quantification of MP levels in these channels are pertinent since both rivers are listed among polluted rivers in Malaysia with high amount of rubbish. Surface sediments were collected with a box corer and MP were extracted via density separation. The inspection of particles was carried out under microscope and were categorized based on shape, colour, and size. Preliminary results showed that the concentration of MP was much higher in Tebrau than of Skudai River.

In comparison, only a few studies provide evidence for the presence of plastic debris in freshwater environments. However, owing to the numerous differences between freshwater studies (including studied species and habitats, geographical locations, social and economic contexts, the type of data obtained and also the broad range of purposes), they show only fragments of the overall picture of freshwater plastic pollution. This highlights the lack of a holistic vision and evidences several knowledge gaps and data biases. Through a bibliometric analysis we identified such knowledge gaps, inconsistencies and survey trends of plastic pollution research within freshwater ecosystems.        We conclude that there is a continued need to increase the field-data bases about plastics (all size fractions) in freshwater environments. This is particularly important to estimate river plastic emissions to the world's oceans. Accordingly, data about macroplastics from most polluted and larger rivers are very scarce, although macroplastics represent a huge input in terms of plastics weight. In addition, submerged macroplastics may play an important role in transporting mismanaged plastic waste, however almost no studies exist. Although many of the most plastic polluted rivers are in Asia, only 14% of the reviewed studies were carried out in this continent (even though the major inland fisheries of the world are located in Asia's rivers). The potential damage caused by macroplastics on a wide range of freshwater fauna is as yet undetermined, even though negative impacts have been well documented in similar marine species. We also noted a clear supremacy of microplastic studies over macroplastic ones, even though there is no reason to assume that freshwater ecosystems remain unaffected by macro-debris.        Finally, we recommend focusing monitoring efforts in most polluted rivers worldwide, but particularly in countries with rapid economic development and poor waste management. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

No toxicity was observed from N-SWCNT and PEG-SWCNT exposure. We demonstrated that water dispersibility, surface chemistry, biomedical properties and salinity were important factors in assessing the aquatic toxicity of nanomaterials.

Among the 14 prey groups identified in the stomachs of red mullet, the predominant one was Bivalvia, followed by Nematoda, Polychaeta, Brachyura and Cumacea. Data analysis revealed significant differences in prey species composition between seasons (ANOSIM, R = 0.089, p < 0.001). Moreover, the prey groups that constituted the majority of the diet changed significantly with a season. SIMPER analysis revealed that the prey item contributing the most to the differences between seasons was Bivalvia, Microplastic was also found in the samples. Analysis of the daily rhythm diet variation in stomach contents allowed the identification of 8 prey groups, namely Bivalvia, Amphipoda and Cumacea. In 24 -hour examinations, feeding began in the first hours of the day, then showed an increase in the following hours and decreased after the evening. The results of this study could be used to describe the diversity of prey species and intraspecific food competition in the Black Sea."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

It is very valued for biomedical application but remained challenging due to the lack of ideal FL PDT agent. In this work, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active FL probe (AIE-FR-TPP) by conjugation of a far red/near-infrared (FR/NIR) emitting AIE fluorogen with the mitochondria-targeting group, is reported as a multi-functional fluorophore for mitochondrial imaging and PDT. As for bioimaging, AIE-FR-TPP can selectively light up the cellular mitochondria with low working concentration, short staining time and good biocompatibility. As for PDT, the probe can target mitochondria precisely and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) efficiently both in living cells and zebrafish embryos. Moreover, AIE-FR-TPP is capable of monitoring the morphological changes of mitochondria based on the AIE effect. These results demonstrate that a real-time visual PDT process at the organelle level in living zebrafish embryos is achieved for the first time by using the AIE PS to induce mitochondrial ROS collapse and report the morphological change on site and in time."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention,1 - Type of study",,

This study quantified MPs down to 10 mu m in marine waters of the most populated region in Greenland. A new plastic-free pump-filter system was used to collect MPs from surface waters in the fjord Nuup Kangerlua close to Nuuk. Additionally, we took samples by horizontal tows with a bongo net (300 mu m mesh-size). The median concentrations were 142 MPs m(-3) and 0.12 MPs m(-3) in the pump and bongo samples, respectively. The most abundant polymer was polyester across stations and sampling types. Fibers were the dominant shape in the bongo samples, while non-fibrous particles dominated in the pump samples. MP abundance was lower in the fjord and increased close to Nuuk and towards the open ocean, indicating that Nuuk is an important point source for MPs. In both samples, concentrations of MPs increased with decreasing size, illustrating the importance of quantifying the smallest fraction of MPs. Thus, the use of methods allowing for a quantification of the smallest MPs is vital to reduce the underestimation of MP concentrations in the environment. The smallest size fraction is also most available to plankton-feeding marine invertebrates and an important entry point for MPs into marine food webs. At the found concentrations, immediate adverse effects on the pelagic food webs are unlikely. However, growing anthropogenic activities could increase the risk of MPs to affect the sensitive Arctic ecosystem. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This study evaluated the bacterial toxicity of a wide range of nanomaterials with different surface coatings on Escherichia con K-12 MG1655. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay, which quantifies the threshold for growth inhibition in suspensions of bacteria, was used to rank the toxicity of silver (Ag), cupric oxide (CuO), cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum dots, titanium dioxide (TiO2), nanodiamonds and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Bacteria were exposed for 12 h at 37 degrees C to a dilution series of the test suspensions in 96-well plates. The precision and accuracy of the method was good with coefficients of variation < 10%. In terms of the measured MIC values, the toxicity order of the ENMs was as follows: CdTe quantum dots ammonium-coated, 6 mg L-1 > Ag nanoparticles, 12 mg L-1 > CdTe quantum dots carboxylate-coated, 25 mg L-1 > CdTe quantum dots polyethylene glycol-coated, 100 mg L-1. The MIC values were above the highest test concentration used (100 mg L-1) for CuO, TiO2, nanodiamonds and MWCNTs, indicating low toxicity.

Due to its chemical instability and low water solubility, microencapsulation represents a good alternative to provide better results when employing resveratrol as a nutraceutical ingredient. The main purpose of our work was to use low shear membrane emulsification to produce resveratrol-loaded emulsions of low polydispersity and integrate this process to spray drying to produce a powdered product. Resveratrol was dispersed with palm oil in a continuous phase obtained via Maillard reaction. We evaluated the influence of process conditions and phases composition on emulsions properties and performed the characterization of the spray-dried powder. Emulsions droplet size and span decreased as shear stress was increased. Higher dispersed phase fluxes provided increased droplet size polydispersity. Process conditions were set on 60.0 Pa shear stress and 70 L m(-2)h(-1) of dispersed phase flux, obtaining emulsions with mean diameter around 30 mu m and span of 0.76. Despite this relatively high droplet size of the infeed emulsions, the spray drying process resulted in particles with high encapsulation efficiency (97.97 +/- 0.01%), and water content (similar to 3.6%) and diameter (similar to 10.2 mu m) similar to particles obtained from fine emulsions in previously reported works."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Prioritising management actions that target marine plastic pollution require spatial information on the dispersal and settlement of plastics from both local and external sources. However, there is a mismatch between the scale of most plastic dispersal studies (regional, national and global) and the scale relevant to management action (local). We use a fine-resolution hydrodynamic model to predict the potential exposure of coastal habitats and species (mangroves, coral reefs and marine turtles) to plastic pollution at the local scale of a management region (the 1,700 km(2) Whitsunday Islands, Queensland, Australia). We assessed the potential exposure of mangroves, coral reefs and marine turtles to plastics during the two dominant wind conditions of the region; the trade wind and monsoon wind seasons. We found that in the trade wind season (April to September) all habitats and species had lower exposure than during the monsoon wind season (October to March). In both wind seasons we found a small proportion of coral reef habitat and large area of turtle habitat were in high potential exposure categories. Unlike coral reefs or marine turtles, mangroves had consistent hotspots of high exposure across wind seasons. Local scale management requires data at fine resolution to capture the variability that occurs at this scale. The outputs of our study can inform the development of conservation resources and local scale management action. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Overall, 19 litter particles were found in the GIT of 13 demersal elasmobranchs (%O = 21) and for the first time, evidence of litter ingestion byR. clavatain Mediterranean waters was also reported. InG. melastomus and R. clavata all anthropogenic particles were plastics, whereas in S. caniculaother litter categories were also found. No litter ingestion was instead observed in E. spinax. More than 50% of litter particles belonged to microlitter category (<5 mm). Polyamide was the only polymer typology found in all examined species. We described the procedures to control the airborne contamination applied at each step of laboratory analysis and, thanks to the application of our control method, it was possible to exclude the 95% of fibers found in samples from the assessment. Moreover, we compared fibers abundances observed in samples and controls.

Although numerous investigations of shoreline, surface and near-surface plastic debris provide important information on plastic types, distribution, accumulation, and degradation, studies of submerged plastic debris have been sporadic in the past and have become more prominent only recently. The distribution of benthic debris is controlled mainly by combinations of urban proximity and its association with fishing-related activities, geomorphology, hydrological conditions, and river input. High density plastics, biofouled products, polymers with mineral fillers or adsorbed minerals, and plastic-metal composites all have the potential to sink. Once deposited on the bottoms of water basins and channels, plastics are shielded from UV light, thus slowing the degradation process significantly. Investigations of the interactions between benthic plastic debris and bottom-dwelling organisms will help shed light on the potential dangers of submerged plastic litter."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

GRF was also better than the suture when comparing fixation of cartilage to the periosteum and inflammatory reaction. Objective: Cartilage grafting is an interesting option for refinements on rhinoplasties. The objective of this study was to compare butyl-2-cyanoacrylate to GRF and suture to determine the efficacy of these methods in restraining grafted cartilage in rabbits. Materials and methods: Fifteen male adult New Zealand rabbits underwent surgery with the aim of collecting six auricular cartilage grafts from each animal. Two of these grafts in each animal were glued together with butyl-2-cyanoacrylate, two were glued together with compound GRF, and two were sewn together with nylon suture. These sandwich grafts were then glued or sutured to the periosteum of the glabella. After 2, 6, and 12 weeks, groups of five animals were sacrificed and histological analysis for inflammation was performed. Cartilage graft migration, adhesion, and deformities of the grafts were also evaluated. Results: There was less migration of the cartilages glued with GRF than with cyanoacrylate and suture. GRF showed statistically less inflammatory reaction and angiogenesis than the other two methods. The three methods showed a tendency to decrease of fibrosis, inflammation, and angiogenesis as weeks passed. There was no detachment or deformity in the cartilage sandwiches sutured to the glabella's periostium. The majority of detached and deformed cartilages were those glued with cyanoacrylate. The number of detached cartilages was directly related to the number of deformed cartilages.

In response, concerns about risks to marine wildlife upon exposure to the varied forms of plastic debris have increased, stimulating new research into the extent and consequences of plastics contamination in the marine environment. Here, I present a framework to evaluate the current understanding of the sources, distribution, fate, and impacts of marine plastics. Despite remaining knowledge gaps in mass budgeting and challenges in investigating ecological impacts, the increasing evidence of the ubiquity of plastics contamination in the marine environment, the continued rapid growth in plastics production, and the evidence-albeit limited-of demonstrated impacts to marine wildlife support immediate implementation of source-reducing measures to decrease the potential risks of plastics in the marine ecosystem."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

APN entrains silt and organic matter and increases sediment temperatures degrading habitat underneath the APN. APN present hazards to fish and wildlife and is a source of plastics to the marine environment.

The log-transformed leached proportions of BFRs at equilibrium were significantly correlated with logK(OW) of BFRs (p < 0.05).

Although less catch efficient than nylon gillnets, biodegradable PBSAT gillnets show great potential for reducing ghost fishing and plastic pollution at sea, which are major problems in these fisheries."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Plastic particles were found in 2.6% of the examined fish and in five of the seven species. No plastics were found in gray gurnard and mackerel. In most cases, only one particle was found per fish, ranging in size from 0.04 to 4.8 mm. Only particles larger than 0.2 mm, being the diameter of the sieve used, were considered for the data analyses, resulting in a median particle size of 0.8 mm. The frequency of fish with plastic was significantly higher (5.4%) in the southern North Sea, than in the northern North Sea above 55 degrees N (1.2%). The highest frequency (>33%) was found in cod from the English Channel. In addition, small fibers were initially detected in most of the samples, but their abundance sharply decreased when working under special clean air conditions. Therefore, these fibers were considered to be artifacts related to air born contamination and were excluded from the analyses. No relationship was found between the condition factor (size-weight relationship) of the fish and the presence of ingested plastic particles."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Purpose: In this study, subacute effect due to co-exposure to low-dose silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and lead acetate (Pb) on cardiovascular system was detected in Sprague Dawley male rats.        Materials and Methods: Histopathological and ultrastructural changes of heart, aortic arch and abdominal aorta were detected. Blood routine and blood biochemistry examinations were used to show the changes of blood components. The fibrinolytic and plasmin factors, inflammation-related factors and myocardial-related enzyme in serum were analysised by ELISA and Western blot assay.        Results: Histopathological and ultrastructural examination of heart, aortic arch, and abdominal aorta showed that serious damage occurred in co-exposure group (n= 6/group). Blood routine examination showed that leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia increased markedly, while changes in the erythrocyte count were not obvious in the co-exposure group. The expression of alanine transaminase (ALT) decreased obviously in co-exposure group, while no significant changes were noted in the expression of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), cholesterol (CHO), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in the co-exposure group on blood biochemistry analysis. In addition, data from ELISA analysis showed that the levels of fibrinolytic and plasmin factors, including thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), and antithrombin III (AT III), were decreased, while those of human fibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer (D2D) increased significantly in the co-exposure group. Moreover, the myocardial-related enzyme in serum, tested by ELISA, and cardiovascular-related protein expression of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide, tested by Western blot assay, was increased in the heart. Furthermore, the expression of inflammation factors such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was increased in heart tissue subjected to combined exposure, which was manifested by Western blot assay, while the protein levels of angiotensin II (ANG II) and endothelin 1 were (ET-1) elevated in blood vessels in the co-exposure group.        Conclusion: In conclusion, the major interactions involved in subacute toxicity due to coexposure to low doses of SiNPs and Pb on cardiovascular system were expected to be additive and synergistic in nature. Co-exposure to SiNPs and Pb could aggravate the cardiovascular toxicity via endothelial damage, hypercoagulation, and cardiac injury in vivo."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

The naturally slow biological and chemical processes operating at depth, coupled with the types of materials that are used commercially, suggest that debris is likely to persist in the deep ocean for long periods of time, ranging from hundreds to thousands of years. However, the realized scale of marine debris accumulation in the deep ocean is unknown due to the logistical, technological, and financial constraints related to deep-ocean exploration. Coordinated deep-water exploration from 2015 to 2017 enabled new insights into the status of deep-sea marine debris throughout the central and western Pacific Basin via ROV expeditions conducted onboard NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer and RV Falkor. These expeditions included sites in United States protected areas and monuments, other Exclusive Economic Zones, international protected areas, and areas beyond national jurisdiction. Metal, glass, plastic, rubber, cloth, fishing gear, and other marine debris were encountered during 17.5% of the 188 dives from 150 to 6,000 m depth. Correlations were observed between deep-sea debris densities and depth, geological features, and distance from human-settled land. The highest densities occurred off American Samoa and the main Hawaiian Islands. Debris, mostly consisting of fishing gear and plastic, were also observed in most of the large-scale marine protected areas, adding to the growing body of evidence that even deep, remote areas of the ocean are not immune from human impacts. Interactions with and impacts on biological communities were noted, though further study is required to understand the full extent of these impacts. We also discuss potential sources and long-term implications of this debris."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

In emerging economies such as those in the Coral Triangle, the communities affected are among the poorest of their countries. To understand the consequences of ocean plastic pollution in coastal regions, through the eyes of local people, this study examines the knowledge, use, disposal and local consequences of single use plastics in remote island communities in two archipelagos of southern Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using mixed methods-a survey of plastic literacy and behaviour, household interviews about purchasing and disposal, and focus group discussions to generate shared mental models-we identify a complex set of factors contributing to extensive plastic leakage into the marine environment. The rising standard of living has allowed people in low resource, remote communities to buy more single-use plastic items than they could before. Meanwhile complex geography and minimal collection services make waste management a difficult issue, and leave the communities themselves to shoulder the impacts of the ocean plastic crisis. Although plastic literacy is low, there is little the coastal communities can do unless presented with better choice architecture both on the supply side and in disposal options. Our results suggest that for such coastal communities improved waste disposal is urgent. Responsible supply chains and non-plastic alternatives are needed. Producers and manufacturers can no longer focus only on low-cost packaged products, without taking responsibility for the outcomes. Without access to biodegradable, environmentally friendly products, and a circular plastic system, coastal communities and surrounding marine ecosystems will continue to be inundated in plastic waste."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANG: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The results were compared with those previously determined from Lake Huron, where abundant plastic pellets characterize the southeastern shoreline. Lake Erie and St. Clair shorelines contained some pellets, but were mainly characterized by plastic fragments and intact products, respectively. The potential sources for the pellets include spillage within factories or during transport and off-loading; whereas intact products were derived from urban waste. Once entering the lake environment low density floating polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene were degraded by UVB radiation at either the water surface or once deposited on shorelines. Mechanical degradation by wave action and/or sand abrasion fragmented intact products into cm-size particles. Certain textures identified on the surfaces of plastic particles could be related to the nature of the depositional environment. Plastics sampled from infrequently visited muddy, organic-rich shorelines were characterized by more adhering particles and less mechanical pits than those from sandy shorelines. In terms of relative distribution, the Lake St Clair shoreline contained the least amount of plastic debris of. the three lakes. This is a function of the breakwaters and retaining walls built along Lake St. Clair, which replace natural sandy or muddy sinks for floating polymers. This study represents the first detailed record of plastics distribution along multiple, but related fresh water shorelines. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Inputs from shipping and fishing activities with additional contributions from society's throw away lifestyle has inundated healthy seas, endangered wildlife and degraded the health of the oceans. International, European and Scot's law governing the marine environment exists on a legally and non-legally binding basis, with the strictest of regulations concerning marine litter more commonly found on a non-legally binding basis. A global response is necessary to curb the issue but despite commitments to protect the marine environment, many States that have committed to reducing environmental pollution via international treaties are lagging on their promises. The introduction of marine planning to reduce conflict between users and the marine environment has the potential to address marine litter and to uphold commitments for healthy seas under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. This paper, using a scientific literature-based analysis, evaluates international, European and Scottish environmental law that addresses aspects of marine litter, including inputs, types of marine litter and the outcomes of parties found guilty of contributing to the issue. Integration of these policies within regional marine plans utilising local knowledge has become the first step in tackling this ubiquitous problem, as well as increasing awareness of policies and marine planning amongst the public. A survey was carried out in Scotland to establish awareness levels on these topics: awareness of marine litter (100%), marine planning (34%) and regional marine plans (33%). Raising public awareness of marine planning will aid its effectiveness in reducing the presence and impact of marine litter."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

This study is a review of plastic pollution reports from the African aquatic environment with regard to causes, current status, toxicological implications and implications for ecosystem services. A total of 59 plastic pollution studies from 1987 to September 2020 were reviewed. They comprised 15 from North Africa (NA) (Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia), six from East Africa (EA) (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda), 13 from West Africa (WA) (Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Nigeria), and 25 studies from Southern Africa (SA) (South Africa). This shows that plastic pollution studies in Africa, according to the sub-regions, are in the order: SA > NA > WA > EA. High human population in the basins of African large aquatic systems is identified as the greatest driver enhancing plastic surge in the aquatic environment. The occurrence of plastics was mostly reported in the estuarine/marine environment (42 studies) compared to the freshwater environment (only 17 studies). Plastics have also been reported in the three compartments of the aquatic environment: water column, benthic sediment and animals. Zooplankton, annelids, molluscs, insects, fishes and birds were reported as bioindicators of plastic ingestion in the inland and coastal waters of Africa. Polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (polyester) and polypropylene were the common plastic polymers observed in the African aquatic environment. In situ toxicological implications of the ingested plastic polymers were not reported in any of the studies. However, reports from laboratory-controlled experiments showed that these polymers are deleterious to aquatic animal health. More research efforts need to delineate the plastic pollution status of the East, West and North of Africa. Furthermore, such studies are required to identify the plastic polymers and in situ ecotoxicological impacts of plastics on both animal and human health."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

This material comes directly from offshore disposal or by fishing debris, other marine activities, and by marine currents and winds, as well as urban drainage systems and estuaries. Specifically, in the case of plastic pellets, which are spheres with 2-5 mm that constitute the raw material for the manufacture of plastic products, the Santos Port and the plastic factories in Cubatao city (Brazilian southeastern coast), are considered the main local sources for the Sao Paulo state coast. Consequently, the beaches most affected by this pollutant are those near Santos estuary, like Enseada do Guaruja ' beach. However, some questions are still open, such as: what are the mechanisms which control the pellets deposition, and which locations are most favorable for deposition on the beach? To answer these questions, a four-step research was carried out at Enseada beach: 1) Plastic pellets geodetic survey based on GNSS positioning; 2) Beach geomorphometric parameters (altitude, aspect, and slope) derived by Digital Elevation Model (DEM); 3) Strandline altitude estimated through wave climate and tide height; and, 4) Plastic pellets deposition Suitability Index (PSI). The joint analysis of the altimetric, geomorphometric and meteoceanographic aspects showed that the beach areas with altitudes higher than those calculated for the strandline (>2.06 m), slope similar to 3 degrees and facing the same direction of the higher energy waves (157.5-202.5 degrees) were more susceptible to pellet deposition. This indicates that the accumulation of this pollutant on the beach is controlled not only by its physical characteristics, but mainly by storm surge events. Besides, surveys with geodetic reference (fixed, univocal, and relatively stable on time) bring up altimetric information as a result of all interactions and can be compared with other beaches anywhere on the planet - thus contributing to a standardization of the survey methodology."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The aim of this study was to quantify the released amount of embedded C-14-MWCNT epoxy (E) nanocomposites. Furthermore, bioaccumulation of the released material was investigated in Lumbriculus variegatus.        The release of radioactivity (RA) from irradiated (+SSR) E/C-14-MWCNT composites was quantified after a series of mechanical treatments and in a quartz sandwater system. Non-irradiated composites served as control group (-SSR). Unlabeled +/- SSR-nanocomposites were analyzed by means of electron microscopy. The exposure of blackworms to the released material and the amount of RA in the water phase, the quartz sand, and the faeces was quantified.        About 0.1% of the embedded RA was released from +SSR-nanocomposites by mechanical treatment and exposure in the quartz sand-water system, which was about 23 times higher compared to -SSR composites. This corresponds to around 3 mg C-14-MWCNT m(-2) for both approaches. Based on the released mass per composite area, +SSR plates set free a 50-fold higher amount of RA. A detectable amount of 7.3 +/- 1.8 ng of C-14-MWCNT was also found in the water phase of the quartz sand-water systems. Electron microscopy revealed an enhanced surface degradation of the composites after SSR and mechanical treatments. Released polymer particles also contained protruding MWCNT. An amount of 2.4 +/- 1.8% of released RA was taken up by blackworms after 2 d and about 66% of ingested material was eliminated again after 24 h.        The results of this study show that SSR leads to an enhanced release of mostly E-polymer associated MWCNT from nanocomposites that are bioavailable for sediment-dwelling organisms, although the absolute amount of released material is low. Follow-up studies examining toxicological effects after uptake are essential for the environmental risk assessment of MWCNT and E/MWCNT-composites."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""Angelo""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,ANG: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,
