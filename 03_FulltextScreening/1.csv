As improperly disposed masks enter the ocean, the risk to the marine ecological system is further aggravated, especially in the shoreline environment. The objective of this study is to explore the changing characteristics and environmental behaviors of disposable masks when exposed to the shoreline environment. The transformation of chain structure and chemical composition of masks as well as the decreased mechanical strength of masks after UV weathering were observed. The melt-blown cloth in the middle layer of masks was found to be particularly sensitive to UV irradiation. A single weathered mask can release more than 1.5 million microplastics to the aqueous environment. The physical abrasion caused by sand further exacerbated the release of microplastic particles from masks, with more than 16 million particles released from just one weathered mask in the presence of sand. The study results indicate that shorelines are not only the main receptor of discarded masks from oceans and lands, but also play host to further transformation of masks to plastic particles.

However, most research is limited to treatment-level effects, ignoring that there may be substantial within-population variation in responses to anthropogenic stressors. MP exposure experiments often reveal considerable, yet largely overlooked, inter-individual variation in particle uptake within concentration treatments. Here, we investigated to what degree treatment-level responses to MP exposure may be affected by variation in MP ingestion rates in the early life stages of a marine fish, the Gilt-head seabream, Sparus aurata. First, we tested whether MP ingestion variation is repeatable. Second, we assessed to what degree this variation may determine individual-level effects of MP exposure on fitness-related behavioural performance (i.e., escape response). We found that consistent inter-individual variation in MP ingestion was prevalent and led to differential impacts within exposure treatments. Individuals with high MP ingestion rates exhibited markedly inferior escape responses, a result that was partially concealed in treatment-level analyses. Our findings show that the measured response of populations to environmental perturbations could be confounded by variation in individual-level responses and that the explicit integration of MP ingestion variation can reveal cryptic patterns during exposure experiments.

Due to their generally short timeframe and recent focus, contemporary studies of microplastics in fish are unable to inform past patterns of microplastic ingestion, and as such there is a knowledge gap regarding when microplastics began showing up in fishes. We examined n = 185 historical (museum) fish samples representing seven species from five freshwater systems across 51 years in order to look for microplastic samples over time. We found only three microplastic particles, two of which were in the more recent years of collection (1996 and 2006). Although our results are not conclusive toward understanding the true nature of microplastic occurrence over time in fishes, our findings present strong evidence that southeast U.S. stream fish likely did not ingest large numbers of microplastics during the 20th century.

The contamination has been threatening animals such as fish, wild birds, domesticated poultry, and waterfowls. This preliminary research aimed to reveal the evidence of microplastic contamination in domesticated duck to prove that plastic contamination has spread massively and depicts how far the local duck ingests microplastic. Total 25 duck samples were collected from local duck intensive husbandry in five cities, i.e., Semarang and Pati (coastal area), Salatiga (lowland area), and Temanggung and Magelang (highland area). Duck intestinal tract samples were collected and were further digested using 10 N KOH at 60â€“80 Â°C for 24 h. The mixture was then collected into vial tubes and was centrifuged to get the pellet. The microplastic identification was conducted using a stereo microscope based on its size and shape. Based on the observation result, microplastic debris in the form of the filament was 49, 39, and 27 per individual in the duck sample from Salatiga, Semarang, and Magelang, respectively. The ingestion of plastic may come from duck feed, such as rough fish (mainly were obtained from the Java Sea) and water. This finding is essential to disseminate since microplastic contamination can be transferred from animals to humans and threaten health. Also, this result can contribute to policymakers deciding on plastic reduction.

In recent years, microplastics have attracted more attention due to their ubiquitous environmental distribution, especially in water environment. Little is known about the pollution of microplastics in the terrestrial environment, especially in areas where there is no active input of MPs. It has been documented that MPs are widely detected in atmospheric dustfall and sewage sludge. However, there are few studies on the input fluxes of MPs to terrestrial environment, such as dust deposition and land-application of sludge. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a thermally stable and chemically inert polyester and can be used to produce polyester fabrics, beverage bottles, plastic films, etc. PET accounts for one-third of total plastics in China, with an annual consumption of 37.5 million tons. In this study, we optimized an alkali-assisted chemical depolymerization method coupled with liquid chromatographymass spectrometry to detect PET polymers in the environmental samples. The limits of quantification for PET MPs in atmospheric dustfall and sewage sludge were 195 ng (per 50 mg dustfall) and 180 ng (per 100 mg sludge), respectively. The method was applied to quantify PET polymers in atmospheric dustfall and sewage sludge samples collected in Tianjin, China. The results showed that PET could be detected in all dustfall samples with concentrations ranging from 776 to 5399 Î¼g/g. The input fluxes of PET MPs via dust deposition were calculated as 100-586 Î¼g m-2 d-1 in Tianjin. Additionally, region- and season-related fluxes were estimated. High deposition fluxes were observed in the upper and lower directions of the prevailing wind in Tianjin. There was a significant difference in the deposition flux of PET polymers between dry season and rainy season. The annual settlement of PET MPs in Tianjin was estimated to be 4.8-28 t. The concentrations of PET polymers in sewage sludge were 296-519 Î¼g/g. The laundry water of polyester fabric clothing may be the main source of PET polymer in sewage treatment system. The total amounts of PET MPs discharged with sludge were calculated to be 186-326 t/a in Tianjin and 2370-4150 t/a in China. This accounts for roughly 0.006%- 0.011% of its total annual consumption in China. Assuming that 15% of the sewage sludge is applied as fertilizer, the estimated annual input of PET MPs to farmland is 28-49 t in Tianjin and 356-622 t in China. Besides, concentrations of PET polymers were found as high as 73-944 Î¼g/g in the mineralized garbage soil from a landfill. This indicates an estimated input of ~20000 tons of PET MPs to terrestrial environment, through the utilization of mineralized garbage soil for municipal application. Atmospheric deposition is an important way for microplastics to enter the terrestrial environment, and the spatial and temporal distribution of the input flux is relatively uniform. The utilization of sludge and mineralized garbage soil may lead to the intensive investment of microplastics in farmland and urban environment, and its ecological risk is worthy of attention.

Sampling points were selected considering the location of industrial, urban and Hara forest protected areas. In November 2017, a total of 18 sediment samples from coastal sediments (top 0â€“10 cm) and the most consumed bivalve species in the region were collected from two stations, Lengeh and Bandar Abbas Ports. The average concentration of heavy metals (except for Ni and Cd) in the sediments were lower than their average shale and the upper continental crust. Enrichment factors revealed significant enrichment of Ni, Mn, Cr, Cd and As. The fractionation of heavy metals using the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction scheme indicated the high bioavailability of Zn, As, Mn, and Co. In general, the highest concentration of Mo, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cr, Cu, Mn, Hg, and Sb was detected in areas with frequent human activities including Shahid Rajaee Port, Shahid Bahonar Port, and Tavanir station. Shahid Rajaee and Shahid Bahonar Ports are the most important ports on the coast of Hormozgan province. The Risk Assessment Code calculated for the study elements indicates that As, Co, Zn, and Cu pose a moderate environmental risk a threat to the aquatic biota. Health risks of most heavy metals arising from bivalves consumption were safe, except for As which is associated with the high target cancer risk values. With reference to the type of microplastics found, they were mainly fibeours with lengths ranging between 100 and 250 Î¼m in sediments and bivalves. Most of the microfibers found in the sediments were made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP), and the fibers found in the bivalves were made of PP.

The paramagnetism and high atomic number of Tb provide TbNRs with both magnetic relaxivity and X-ray attenuation capabilities. After surface functionalization with a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-derived ligand, TbNRs showed high colloidal stability in physiological media. Additionally, toxicity studies conducted in cell cultures and zebrafish embryos demonstrated the safety of the as-synthesized TbNRs, thus supporting their potential use as CAs. Lastly, in vivo imaging experiments in mice demonstrated that TbNRs produce remarkable contrast enhancement on both MRI and CT.

While many studies have focused on the toxicity of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) in aquatic environments there is no clear conclusion on their environmental risk, which can be attributed to a lack of standardization of protocols for in situ sampling, laboratory experiments and analyzes. There are also far more studies concerning marine environments than fresh or brackish waters despite their role in the transfer of plastics from continents to oceansWe systematically reviewed the literature for studies: (1) using plastics representative of those found in the environment in laboratory experiments, (2) on the contamination of plastic particles in the continuum between fresh and marine waters, focusing in particular on estuaries and (3) on the continuum of contamination of plastic particles between species through trophic transfer in aquatic environments. We found that the exposure of aquatic organisms in the laboratory to plastic particles collected in the environment are very scarce. Moreover, plastic exposures of estuarine species in the laboratory are generally carried out for a single salinity and a single temperature that do not reflect the fluctuating environmental conditions of estuaries. Finally, the trophic transfer of plastic particles is mainly studied in the laboratory through simple food chains which are not representative of the complexity of the trophic networks observed in the aquatic environment. We pointed out that future studies in the laboratory should include both MPs and NPs sampled in the environment and focus on the precise characterization of the composition and surface of these plastics as well as on their absorbed pollutants, additives or biofilms.

Our ability to judge the severity of observed behavioral responses is hampered by limited knowledge regarding how subtle behavior modifications in prey fish affect ecosystems. Here we show that anthropogenic stressors affecting fish boldness are not expected to cause population collapse, but rather elusive effects on fish length, population biomass, reproduction and ecosystem state shifts. We use a physiologically structured population model (three trophic levels), well fed with empirical data, to simulate how previously suggested alterations of fish boldness traits due to anthropogenic stressors affect ecosystem structure. Our results suggest that these stressors may cause ecosystem structure effects, such as skewed size distributions, reduced fish biomass and reduced reproduction success, by altering the foraging behavior of fish. However, the specific structure effects depend on where the boldnessâ€“shyness continuum change occurs and on the species-specific life stages. The model also highlights somewhat counterintuitive effects leading to possible extinction of predators when the foraging behavior of the prey is hampered. We conclude that anthropogenic forcing of fish behavior may be a hidden mechanism behind ecosystem structure changes in both freshwater and marine ecosystems.

There are also high levels of plastic contamination reported across benthic sediments and shorelines of the Great Lakes. Citizen science data reveals macroplastic across Great Lakes shorelines, with more than three million pieces of plastic litter recorded over a span of three years. We completed a second systematic review of plastic pollution and its impact on freshwater ecosystems in general to inform how plastic in the Great Lakes may impact wildlife.

It was found that EHS concentrations in F0 and F1 in co-exposure groups were higher than those in single exposure. The hatching rates of F0 and F1 decreased and the malformation and mortality rates of F1 increased, especially in co-exposure groups. For F0, antioxidant indicators (including glutathione, reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde contents, and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities) and thyroid indicators (e.g.triiodothyronine contents and thyroid receptor A, thyroid receptor B and deiodinase 2 expression levels) in all test groups containing EHS were all increased, while the thyroxin content and deiodinase 1 expression levels were reduced compared with the corresponding control group. F1 showed similar or even stronger biochemical effects, while the indicators mentioned above for F0 and F1 in co-exposure groups were further intensified on the basis of EHS alone. Our results showed that the presence of PS-NPs may promote the bioaccumulation of EHS and its transfer from parents to offspring. EHS could induce growth and developmental toxicity, oxidative stress and thyroid toxicity on both parents and offspring, while PS-NPs and EHS exerted interactive effects on the transgenerational effects of EHS on zebrafish. Ultimately, two associated potential adverse outcome pathways of transgenerational toxicity were identified in EHS and PS-NP co-exposure: 1) destruction of thyroid hormone homeostasis; 2) generation of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde.

Most of the New Zealand records were not identified in recently published global assessments of plastic ingestion by fish; the likely reasons for this are discussed. Consumption of anthropogenic debris by fish in New Zealand waters is probably a widespread phenomenon, particularly for inshore demersal species with an algal dietary component and for offshore pelagic species that prey on gelatinous biota. Based on currently available data, this behaviour may occur relatively less frequently in deeper water demersal habitats, although no studies investigating the ingestion of microplastic particles by fish in this section of the New Zealand marine environment have yet been completed.

Controlled feeding studies can help advance our understanding of dietary uptake, bioaccumulation, and associated effects of (nano)particulate contaminants in fish, and also provide information about their likelihood to be transferred along the trophic chain and or to act as vector for other, surface-adsorbed pollutants. However, traditional approaches to prepare test feed for dietary exposure studies where commercial fish feed such as flakes, granules or pellets are soaked or spray-spiked with dissolved chemicals are not well suitable for (nano-)particulate contaminants. Microplastics, which often have sizes in the Âµm to mm range, and manufactured nanomaterials, in particular those which are soluble, such as metal/metal oxide nanoparticles, have to be incorporated into the feed to avoid their dissociation and or dissolution before the feed is ingested by the animal to avoid undesired waterborne exposure, which may confound results. â€¢ Here we describe a methodological approach to produce worm-shaped food packages, that is a practical diet, of controlled diameter and length (in the millimeter range), which allows to prepare food rations with a weight in the order of a few milligrams and to adjust the food rations to the individual body wet weight of small experimental fish with high accuracy (Â±0.5 mg) without the need for weighing/proportioning the feed using a scale. â€¢ The method can be used to prepare test feed with internally incorporated particulate contaminants, such as manufactured nanomaterials and nano- and microplastics, to assess the latter's dietary uptake, bioaccumulation and associated toxicity in fish. We described two protocol variations: One using dry starting material, such as feed flakes, and one using liquid starting material, such as worm homogenate. â€¢ The method has been developed for academic research environments with no access to specialized equipment for test feed preparation, and uses utensils and inexpensive plastic ware belonging to the standard inventory of ecotoxicological research laboratories.

Exosomes are intracellular endosome-originating, cell-secreted, small nano-size EV. They can transfer cargo molecules like miRNAs to act intracellularly in targeted acceptor cells, to then mediate epigenetic functional alterations. Exosomes among EV, are universal nanoparticles of life that are present across all species. Some critics mistakenly hold exosomes to concepts and standards of cells, whereas they are subcellular nanospheres that are a million times smaller, have neither nuclei nor mitochondria, are far less complex and currently cannot be studied deeply and elegantly by many and diverse technologies developed for cells over many years. There are important concerns about the seeming impossibility of biologically significant exosome transfers of very small amounts of miRNAs resulting in altered targeted cell functions. These hesitations are based on current canonical concepts developed for non-physiological application of miRNAs alone, or artificial non-quantitative genetic expression. Not considered is that the natural physiologic intercellular transit via exosomes can contribute numerous augmenting carrier effects to functional miRNA transfers. Some of these are particularly stimulated complex extracellular and intracellular physiologic processes activated in the exosome acceptor cells that can crucially influence the intracellular effects of the transferred miRNAs. These can lead to molecular chemical changes altering DNA expression for mediating functional changes of the targeted cells. Such exosome mediated molecular transfers of epigenetic functional alterations, are the most exciting and life-altering property that these nano EV bring to virtually all of biology and medicine.

In fine sediments, nematodes account for up to 90% of the meiobenthic organisms and have an important position in benthic food webs, by connecting lower (bacteria) and higher (e.g., macrofauna, fish) trophic levels. Due to their high ecological relevance, ubiquitous occurrence and very high individual densities, nematodes can serve as bioindicators of environmental pollution and especially MP pollution, since the ingested microscopic particles can be easily detected in the transparent bodies of these organisms. Single-species toxicity tests with Caenorhabditis elegans have revealed dose-dependent inhibitory effects on reproduction in nematodes exposed for 96 h to relatively high concentrations of polystyrene (PS) beads. Thus, in this study, we examined whether longer-term multigenerational tests of nematodes under continuous PS bead exposure are able to reveal more subtle impacts of MPs on population growth and whether the observed effects can be linked to the species-specific life history traits of the nematodes. We therefore tested three bacterial-feeding nematode species (C. elegans, Acrobeloides nanus, Plectus acuminatus) by exposing them to 1.0-Âµm PS beads at an exposure concentration of 107 beads mlâˆ’1. The experiment was conducted in semi-fluid medium for 21â€“49 days depending on the life-cycle characteristics of each nematode species. Ingested PS beads were quantified by fluorescence microscopy observations. Population growth rates, carrying capacities as well as doubling time and the time at which the maximum sustainable yield was reached were used to assess the effects of PS bead exposure on nematode population dynamics. All three nematode species readily ingested 1.0-Âµm PS beads in semi-fluid medium, but the number of ingested PS beads varied between species. PS bead exposure significantly decreased the carrying capacity of C. elegans, whereas A. nanus populations grew significantly faster in the presence of the beads. Long-term multigeneration tests revealed more subtle impacts of MP on C. elegans than occurred following short-term exposure scenarios. Our results show that MP-induced changes in nematodes population dynamics can alter nematode communities, which in term may impact the benthic food web.

Oyster tissues contained 51% of all sequenced bacterial pathogens that are considered to be both detrimental and of emerging concern to human health. Using infrared spectroscopy, we examined a total of 1225 individual microdebris particles, from which we detected 78 different types of contaminant materials. The predominant microdebris contaminants recovered from oyster tissues included polymers (48%), followed by non-native minerals (20%), oils (14%) and milk supplement powders (14%).

However, complex sample matrices, such as lipid-rich tissues, require multiple pre-treatment steps which may lead to increased sample processing time and costs, and a reduction in microplastic recovery rates thereby hindering monitoring efforts. Lipid-rich (fat) tissues often pose difficulties for traditional potassium hydroxide (KOH) digestion methods due to saponification. This reaction produces a suspension of glycerol and fatty acids (soaps), which may entrap microplastics inhibiting their recovery and clog filters thus reducing the efficiency of the filtration or inhibiting it altogether. In this study, the incorporation of 100% ethanol (EtOH) to existing KOH digestion methods was found to completely redissolve the viscous saponified gel formed in these reactions, with a digestion efficiency greater than 97% for all treated lipid-rich tissue samples. Recovery of spiked polyethylene and polystyrene fragments, and rayon and polyester fibers, ranged from 93% to 100%. The addition of EtOH did not induce physical or chemical degradation on these polymers. The inclusion of an ad hoc decision-making tool within the digestion workflow reduced pre-processing time for samples and allowed for solid saponified samples to be completely redissolved. This validated workflow facilitates high through-put sampling of biota, by enabling lipid-rich tissues to be filtered with a high degree of efficiency thereby successfully separating microplastics from their gelatinous matrix.

Even with immediate and concerted action, 710 million metric tons of plastic waste cumulatively entered aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. To avoid a massive build-up of plastic in the environment, coordinated global action is urgently needed to reduce plastic consumption; increase rates of reuse, waste collection, and recycling; expand safe disposal systems; and accelerate innovation in the plastic value chain.

However, previous studies have employed mainly commercial, chemically synthesized polystyrene model particles. Commercial NPs made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is widely used in drinking bottles and packaging, are rarely manufactured, and thus have not been frequently studied in the laboratory. This seriously limits our understanding of their real environmental and biological effects. Herein, we employ a simple method for producing PET NPs directly from plastic bottles, preserving the PET chemical properties, and mimicking the mechanical breakdown process of plastics in nature. Using developing zebrafish embryos as an animal model, we investigate the bioaccumulation and in vivo toxicity of the produced PET NPs, which have diameter sizes of 20, 60-80, and 800 nm and are capped by two dispersing agents, i.e., BSA and SDS. This study demonstrates the size-dependent distribution and the size- and concentration-dependent toxicity of PET NPs in terms of hatching rate, heart rate, and ROS generation. It also reveals that the PETBSA NP treatment groups exhibited higher-level abnormalities in heart rate and more severe oxidative damage than the PETSDS NP treatment groups. Taken together, this work proposes a novel mechanical preparation protocol for PET NPs and provides evidence relating to the toxicity of environmentally relevant NPs towards aquatic organisms.

However, they remain largely under-represented in microplastic ecotoxicity studies. The present study aims to investigate particle interaction with, and retention time in, aquatic organisms comparing microfibers, and microbeads. We used brine shrimp (Artemia sp.) and fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as invertebrate and vertebrate models, respectively. Organisms were exposed to a mixture of microbeads (polyethylene, 27â€“32 Î¼m) and microfibers (dope dyed polyester; 500 Î¼m-long) for 2 h, at high concentrations (100,000 part./L) in order to maximize organism-particles interaction. Artemia were exposed in the presence or absence of food. Fish were exposed either via the trophic route or directly via water, and water exposures were performed either in freshwater or seawater. In the absence of food, Artemia ingested high numbers of microbeads, retained in their digestive tract for up to 96 h. Microfiber ingestion was very limited, and its egestion was fast. In the presence of food, no microfiber was ingested, microbead ingestion was limited, and egestion was fast (48 h). Limited particle ingestion was observed in fish exposed via water, and particle retention time in gut did not exceed 48 h, both for direct and trophic exposure. However, water exposures resulted in a higher number of particles present in gills, and average retention time was higher in gills, compared to gut. This suggests that gills are organs susceptible to microplastic exposure and should be taken into account in fish exposure and effect studies. Our results show that particle ingestion and retention by organisms differ between microbeads and microfibers, suggesting particle selection based on size, shape, and/or color and species-specific selective feeding. We also showed that the presence of food results in limited particle ingestion and retention in Artemia and that microbeads are more likely to be transferred to organisms from upper trophic levels than microfibers. Finally, fish exposure to particles was not significantly different between freshwater and seawater conditions.

The investigations of dielectric permittivity and dielectric loss were carried out in the temperature range 300-390 K, the time of irradiation with UV rays were 50, 100, 70 and 150 h, and the filler contents were 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 vol.% and nanoparticles 1 vol.% Al (Fe). It was found that the dielectric constant of UV-irradiated biocomposites with FB additives increases and the dielectric loss decreases. An increase in dielectric constant is also observed with an increase in the volume content of a biological origin filler. Note that the effect of UV irradiation causes the appearance of a new region of dielectric loss in the temperature-dependent tan Î´ of the polyethylene. However, in modified samples after irradiation, under the same conditions, the change in dielectric properties is much less pronounced than in the initial ones, i.e. the dielectric constant increases monotonically, and the value of tan Î´ in the maximum of the new loss region is much smaller. Moreover, the effect of the additive is manifested in slowing down the process of LDPE oxidation in the irradiation zone, since the main losses of the polyethylene are primarily caused by the relaxation of the carbonyl groups. Thus, the observed dependences of and tan Î´ on the time of exposure to UV rays are explained by a change in the physical structure of the polymer matrix and the boundary layer of the components composition under the action of charges formed during irradiation.

First, PMMA blocks were prepared by normal ATRP with controlled degree of polymerizations and grafting density. In a second step, the PS block was synthesized through a chain extension using low parts per million of Cu catalyst. Variation of the SiO2-g-PMMA-Br macroinitiator concentration had a pronounced effect on the modality of the chain extension product. In the limit of small concentration, partial termination resulted in bimodal brush architectures, while more uniform brush architectures were observed with increasing concentration of macroinitiator. Brush nanoparticles with bimodal architectures assembled into string-like aggregates that bore a resemblance to structures found in systems comprised of sparse (homopolymer) brush particles. The unexpected effect of modality on structure formation points to opportunities in controlling microstructures in brush particle materials.

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have been identified as the main executors of liver fibrosis. Unfortunately, no drug has yet been approved for clinical use against liver fibrosis, largely because the tested drugs have been unable to access HSCs and efficiently remove the collagen accumulation involved in fibrogenesis. Here, we designed an efficient HSC-targeting lipid delivery system that carried dual siRNAs intended to both inhibit collagen synthesis and promote collagen degradation, with the goal of realizing enhanced anti-liver fibrosis by bidirectional regulation of collagen accumulation. The delivery system was constructed by using amphiphilic cationic hyperbranched lipoids (C15-PA) for siRNA complexation and helper lipoids (cholesterol-polyethylene glycol-vitamin A, Chol-PEG-VA) for HSCs targeting. The generated vitamin A-decorated and hyperbranched lipoid-based lipid nanoparticles (VLNPs) showed excellent gene-binding ability and transfection efficiency, and enhanced the delivery of siRNAs to HSCs. Fibrotic mice treated with dual siRNA-loaded VLNPs showed a great reduction in the collagen accumulation seen in this model; the enhanced effect of bidirectional regulation reduced the collagen accumulation level in treated mice to almost that seen in normal mice. There was no notable sign of toxicity or tissue inflammation in mice exposed to repeated intravenous administration of the dual siRNA-loaded VLNPs. In conclusion, our results indicate that biocompatible VLNPs designed to exploit precise targeting and an effective bidirectional regulation strategy hold promise for treating liver fibrosis.

In fish and crustacean species, the presence of microplastics has in most cases been investigated and detected only in the gastrointestinal tract, which is commonly not eaten, and when present, only a very small number is usually found. Bivalves are probably the main source of microplastics when consuming seafood. Preliminary assessments have suggested that the contribution of hazardous chemicals from microplastics for top consumers of bivalves is very small compared to other sources.

Research on microplastic pollution in freshwaters has barely begun in New Zealand, and few studies from smaller lotic systems such as streams exist globally. We investigated the extent of microplastic pollution within urban streams across New Zealand and determined if microplastic concentrations were related to human population density and urbanisation of streams. Fifty-two streams were surveyed across five urban agglomerations in January 2019. Microplastics were found in samples from all sites at densities ranging from &lt;1 to 44 items/m3. This concentration range was comparable to global data but lower than reported in another recent New Zealand study, probably due to differences in sampling methodology. Microplastic pollution was similar across all urban centres, and neither length of urbanised catchment nor urban proportion of the stream were significant predictors of microplastic concentrations. These findings suggest microplastic pollution in New Zealand streams are comparable to larger aquatic systems globally, and that smaller urban streams are significant transport pathways for microplastics. We also recommend standardising microplastic sampling methods to a greater extent in the future, to improve comparability across studies.

We evaluated if removal rates were affected by the presence of the coral natural prey (i.e., Artemia salina) and by biofouling on the surface of the microplastic. We found that the coral quickly interacts both actively and passively with microplastics and that the probability for the coral to ingest and retain microplastics was higher when the surface of the microplastic was biofouled.

Plastic polymers being hazardous to the environment, significant efforts have been devoted to evaluate various bio-based polymers as alternatives to synthetic plastic packaging. Chitin and its deacetylated derivative, chitosan, is primarily a by-product of crustacean, fish and seafood processing and handling. Chitosan possesses antimicrobial activities and film forming property, making them attractive biopolymers for food packaging and food preservation applications applied through spraying, dipping, coating, or wrapping by films. Scope and approach: This comprehensive review of contemporary research focuses on applications of chitosan and chitosan based nanocomposites in the area of food packaging and preservation. It includes different properties and functionalities of chitosan, various blends and nanocomposites of chitosan, their fabrication techniques, and applications in shelf life extension of fruits, vegetables, meat and fish products. Key findings and conclusions: Chitosan is an attractive alternative to synthetic plastics polymers due to its biodegradability, antimicrobial activity, and film forming properties. Incorporation of nanomaterials into chitosan based food-packaging systems can prevent the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms, improve food quality and safety, and extend shelf-life of food. It has been reported that applications of chitosan-based films or coatings or treatments have resulted in shelf life extension of fresh produce, meat products, bread, and dairy products such as cheese which has been highlighted.

The prepared material (IIP@ZnS:Mn QDs) was based on Mn-doped ZnS quantum dots coated with (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane and an As(III) ionic imprinted polymer. The novel use of vinyl imidazole as a complexing reagent when synthesizing the ionic imprinted polymer guarantees that both inorganic arsenic species (As(III) and As(V)) can interact with the recognition cavities in the ionic imprinted polymer. After characterization, several studies were performed to enhance the interaction between the targets (As(III) and As(V) ions) and the IIP@ZnS:Mn QDs nanoparticles. The optimization and validation process showed that the composite material offers high selectivity (high imprinting factor) for inorganic arsenic species. The limit of quantification for total inorganic As was 29.6Â Î¼gÂ kgâˆ’1, value lower than the EU/EC regulation limits proposed for other foodstuffs than fish, such as rice. The proposed method is therefore simple, requires short analysis times and offers good sensitivity, precision (inter-day relative standard deviations lower than 10%), and quantitative analytical recoveries. The method has been successfully applied to assess total inorganic arsenic in several fishery products, showing good agreement with the total inorganic arsenic concentration (As(III) plus As(V)) found after applying other advanced and expensive methods such those based on high-performance liquid chromatography hyphenated to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.

The assemblage of estuarine-resident fishes showed high tolerance to environmental variations since these were present all along the estuary and throughout the year. The assemblage of marine estuarineâ€“dependent species was associated with the rainy season and low salinities and temperatures. The assemblages of marine estuarine opportunist fishes were associated with areas of higher environmental variability in both seasons, dry and rainy. Fish species belonging to the same functional group showed variations in their response to environmental changes which evidenced complex spatial and temporal dynamics.

Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine MP pollution of river fish. To this end, we obtained Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) from Tama River Tokyo and Ugui (Tribolodon Hakonensis) from Komaoi River, Hokkaido. We also collected MP samples from the river water in both locations in order to examine the relationships of MP pollution between fishes and river water. Our findings were as follows. In the Komaoi River, MPs were detected in 2 out of 8 Ugui with 0.25 particles on average and up to 1 particle per individual. In the Tama River, MPs were detected in 2 out of 2 Ayu with 4 particles on average and up to 4 particles per individual. Thus, the MP pollution in the Ayu was higher than in the Ugui. In addition, the MP numerical concentrations in the Tama and Komaoi Rivers were 3.75 and 0.50 particles/m3, respectively. Together, these facts show that the MP pollution in the Tama River was greater than that in the Komaoi River and consequently had a greater tendency within its fish.

Microplastics are the most common litters in the marine environment corresponding to 60-80% of the total litter in the worldâ€™s seas. The risk factor of plastics is inversely associated with the size of the plastic. In the present study, we reviewed the state of knowledge regarding the impact of plastic pollution on marine environment and marine species, assessing the ingestion incidences, elimination of plastics, interactions of plastics with other pollutants, and effects on photosynthesis. Records of marine species ingesting plastic have increased and begin to attract considerable attention. Metadata generated from the review of related papers in the present study was used to evaluate the current knowledge on the plastic ingestion by different marine species. The retrieved data from reviewed articles revealed that the ingestion of plastic by marine animals have been documented in more than 560 species including fish, crustaceans, mammals, sea turtles, bivalves, gastropods even in sea stars and limpets. The size of ingested plastics varied from species to species generally depending on the feeding behavior. Microplastics showed the highest number of bibliographic citations in the plastic ingestion studies. They are mostly ingested by planktivorous and filter feeder species. Meso, macro, and occasionally megaplastics are reported in marine mammals and sea turtles since they often confuse plastic for their prey. The sensitivity and size of the detected plastics may vary based on the analytical plastic detection methods. Â© 2020, Central Fisheries Research Inst.

Among potential responses to the issue of marine pollution, the group briefly consideredâ€”but eventually dismissedâ€”the possibility of creating a liability or compensation regime. This essay evaluates the prospects for such a regime. As the essay will show, compensation faces significant conceptual problems, not the least of which is the absence of an obvious recipient. However, some form of liability could be imposed on corporations that produce plastic, or on states that fail to regulate them. Such a liability regime, even without financial compensation, could foster the prevention of further marine plastic pollution. Â© Sandrine Maljean-Dubois and BenoÃ®t Mayer 2020.

In order to establish more comprehensive monitoring programs it is necessary to identify a suit of methods and species that can be systematically used to assess MP pollution in different environmental compartments. The present study had a two aims: (1) to assess the content of MPs in the viviparous blenny Zoarces viviparus (eelpout) sampled in Roskilde Fjord, Denmark, and (2) evaluate whether the eelpout could serve as a relevant indicator organism for MP pollution in relation to monitoring under the MSFD. MPs were found in eelpout from all three stations sampled demonstrating that MPs are ubiquitously present in Roskilde Fjord. The frequency of occurrence (FO%) of MPs in collected eelpout was relatively low (FO% =10.1%) compared to fish species sampled in other locations, which could indicate that eelpout may not be a favorable species for MP biomonitoring, possibly due to its benthic feeding mode. More data is however needed and it is recommended that samples collected for other monitoring purposes are examined for MPs in the coming years together with water and sediment samples collected simultaneously to determine the environment/biota MP ratio for eelpouts.

This is the first study to investigate the contamination status and human health risks of MPs in commercial fish and bivalves collected from fishery markets of two major cities in Fujian province of China and compare them both nationally and internationally. The MP abundances in the bivalves from both cities were found to be lower when compared nationally (Qingdao and Shanghai) as well as internationally to several European countries (Italy, UK, France and Belgium). The MP abundances in the fish from both cities were also lower than reported nationally (Shanghai), but higher when compared internationally (Indonesia, USA and Portugal). In general, a higher percentage of fish than of bivalves tested positive for MPs. Moreover, fish contained higher abundances of total MPs and higher percentages of fibers, polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), blue and longer MPs than bivalves. In contrast, bivalves possessed higher percentages of fragments, films and particles together with polyethylene terephthalate (PET), transparent and shorter MPs than fish. Regarding regional differences, seafood collected at Xiamen had relatively higher abundances of total MPs and higher percentages of PET, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), fragments, films and particles along with black, white and transparent MPs. Whereas seafood from Fuzhou contained higher percentages of other polymers, fibers, and blue MPs. Finally, the polymer risk indexes caused by MPs in seafood were calculated based on the chemical hazards of polymers. The outcome of the risk assessment indicated human health risks posed by MPs via seafood consumption from both cities is likely to be higher than those from Shanghai, UK and South Korea due to greater percentages of PAN contamination.

FET assays were performed in three laboratories using slightly different husbandry and exposure conditions, which, however, were all fully compatible with the limits defined by OECD TG 236. This allowed for testing of potential changes in the FET assay due to protocol variations. The standard endpoints of the FET (acute embryotoxicity) did not reveal any acute toxicity for both virgin MPs and MPs spiked with BP3, BaP, and PFOS. With respect to sublethal endpoints, EROD activity was increased after exposure to MPs spiked with BP3 (3 h pulse) and MPs spiked with BaP (96 h continuous exposure). Cyp1a transcription was increased upon exposure to MPs spiked with BP3 or BaP. For the selected combination of MPs particles and contaminants, the basic FET proved not sensitive enough to reveal effects of (virgin and spiked) MPs.

To monitor the level of plastic waste in an area, and the prospect of it entering the food chain, bioindicator species are used extensively throughout Northern European Seas, however due to their distribution ranges many are not applicable to the Mediterranean Sea. Guidance published for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive suggests that the contents of fish stomachs may be analyzed to determine trends of marine plastic ingestion. In order to equate transnational trends in marine plastic ingestion, the use of standardized fish species that widely occur throughout the basin is favoured, however for the Mediterranean Sea, specific species are not listed. Here we propose a methodology to assess how effective Mediterranean fish species, that are known to have ingested marine plastic, are as bioindicators. A new Bioindicator Index (BI) was established by incorporating several parameters considered important for bioindicators. These parameters included species distribution throughout the Mediterranean basin, several life history traits, the commercial value of each species, and the occurrence of marine litter in their gut contents. By collecting existing data for Mediterranean fish, ranked scores were assigned to each trait and an average value (BI value) was calculated for each species. Based on their habitat preferences, Engraulis encrasicolus (pelagic), Boops boops (benthopelagic), three species of Myctophidae (Hygophum benoiti, Myctophum punctatum and Electrona risso) (mesopelagic), Mullus barbatus barbartus (demersal) and Chelidonichthys lucerna (benthic), were identified as currently, the most suitable fish for monitoring the ingestion of marine plastics throughout the Mediterranean basin. The use of standardized indicator species will ensure coherence in the reporting of marine litter ingestion trends throughout the Mediterranean Sea. Using a novel index, seven species of fish were identified as the most suitable to monitor marine plastic ingestion trends in the Mediterranean Sea.

Using the zebrafish embryo as an animal model, we investigated the bioaccumulation and in vivo toxicity of polystyrene (PS) nanoplastics individually or in combination with the Au ion. We showed that smaller PS nanoplastics readily penetrated the chorion and developing embryos and accumulated throughout the whole body, mostly in lipid-rich regions such as in yolk lipids. We also showed that PS nanoplastics induced only marginal effects on the survival, hatching rate, developmental abnormalities, and cell death of zebrafish embryos but that these effects were synergistically exacerbated by the Au ion in a dose- and size-dependent manner. Such exacerbation of toxicity was well correlated with the production of reactive oxygen species and the pro-inflammatory responses synergized by the presence of PS, supporting the combined toxicity of PS and Au ions. The synergistic effect of PS on toxicity appeared to relate to mitochondrial damage as determined by ultrastructural analysis. Taken together, the effects of PS nanoplastics were marginal but could be a trigger for exacerbating the toxicity induced by other toxicants such as metal ions.

This large gap is evidence of our ignorance about the fate of plastics, as well as transformations and sinks in the oceans. One of the current challenges consists of identifying and quantifying plastic particles at the microscale, the small microplastics (SMP, 25-1000 Î¼m). The aim of the present study is to investigate SMP concentration in count and in mass at the sea surface in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre during the sea campaign Expedition 7 th Continent. After isolation, SMP were characterized by micro-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Microplastic distribution was modeled by a wind-driven vertical mixing correction model taking into account individual particle properties (dimension, shape and density). We demonstrate that SMP buoyancy is significantly decreased compared to the large microplastics (LMP, 1-5 mm) and consequently more susceptible to vertical transport. The uncorrected LMP concentration in count was between 13000 and 174000 pieces km -2 , and was between 5 and 170 times more abundant for SMP. With a wind-driven vertical mixing correction, we estimated that SMP were 300 to 70000 times more abundant than LMP. When discussing this in terms of weight after correction, LMP concentrations were between 50 and 1000 g km -2 , and SMP concentrations were between 5 and 14000 g km -2 .

Microplastics (plastics < 5. mm in size) in particular, have induced alarm among scientific and management bodies as an emerging marine and coastal contaminant. Recent studies suggest that these small plastic particles are ubiquitous in the marine system, as they have been recorded in every coastal and marine habitat around the world. The presence of microplastics in the environment has been shown to have negative consequences for many marine wildlife species, such as marine birds, turtles, and fish. To mitigate the harm caused by plastic pollution, it is essential to understand the life cycle of plastic products, beginning with plastic use and disposal, to the arrival at coastal marine environments. Therefore, this chapter focuses on the issue of plastic pollution in the coastal environment and reviews the current knowledge base on sources, dispersal, accumulation, and most importantly solutions for the problem of plastic pollution. This chapter also discusses and gives examples of current initiatives to reduce the plastic load, including the circular economy approach, and other successful campaigns around the world. Lastly, it discusses the importance of the behavioral, social, and economic changes needed to reduce plastic demand and use for lasting systematic solutions. Â© 2019 Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and Polypropylene (PP) are the most widely used plastics in manufacture of packaging, fibres, and drinking bottles, etc. The degradation of these plastics to micro sizes leads to environmental threats, especially when the micro plastics interact with fresh water microorganism such as microalgae. Therefore, the study on the interaction between micro plastics and microorganisms is really important. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of microplastics on the growth of microalgae Spirulina sp and also to evaluate the contribution of microalgae Spirulina sp to the plastic degradation. The interaction between microalgae and microplastics was evaluated in a 1 L glass bioreactor contained microalgae Spirulina sp and PP and PET microplastics with the size of 1 mm at various concentrations (150 mg/500 mL, 250/500 mL and 275 mg/500 mL) for 112 days. The results showed that the tensile strength of micro plastic PET decreased by 0.9939 MPa/day while PP decreased by 0.1977 MPa/day. The EDX analysis of microplastics showed that the decreasing carbon in PET (48.61%) was higher as compared to PP (36.7%). FTIR analysis of Spirulina sp cells showed that the CO2 evolution of cells imposed by PET microplastic was higher than imposed by PP. The growth rate of Spirulina sp applied by micro plastic was lower than the control and the increase of microplastic concentration significantly reduced the growth rate of algae by 75%. This research concluded that biodegradation has important role in the degradation process of plastic.

The switch from a linear economy with its throwaway culture to a circular economy with efficient reuse of waste plastics is therefore mandatory. Hydrocarbon polymers, accounting for more than half the world's plastics production, enable closed-loop recycling and effective product-stewardship systems. High-molar-mass hydrocarbons serve as highly versatile, cost-, resource-, eco- and energy-efficient, durable lightweight materials produced by solvent-free, environmentally benign catalytic olefin polymerization. Nanophase separation and alignment of unentangled hydrocarbon polymers afford 100% recyclable self-reinforcing all-hydrocarbon composites without requiring the addition of either alien fibers or hazardous nanoparticles. Recycling of durable hydrocarbons is far superior to biodegradation. The facile thermal degradation enables liquefaction and quantitative recovery of low molar mass hydrocarbon oil and gas. Teamed up with biomass-to-liquid and carbon dioxide-to-fuel conversions, powered by renewable energy, waste hydrocarbons serve as renewable hydrocarbon feedstocks for the synthesis of high molar mass hydrocarbon materials. Herein, an overview is given on how innovations in catalyst and process technology enable tailoring of advanced recyclable hydrocarbon materials meeting the needs of sustainable development and a circular economy.

Ecological impacts in the subtropical gyres include invasive species transport and rampant ingestion and entanglement; yet plastics have also created substantial new habitat, resulting in population increases in some species. Though estimates of surface abundance and weight indicate over a quarter million tons and particle counts in the trillions, there is also a rapid removal of microplastics from the sea surface. Recent studies show widespread occurrence of these microplastics throughout the vertical column and in benthic and coastal sediments. It is likely that sedimentation is the ultimate fate for plastic lost at sea. Before microplastics sink, they likely cause significant impacts to marine food chains and ecosystems. In the open ocean, plastics are mingled with marine communities, making removal at sea prohibitive. This new understanding informs mitigation efforts to divert attention away from open-ocean cleanup. Similar to the way societies dealt with widely distributed particulate contamination in the air above cities, the â€œsmogâ€ of microplastics destined to pass through marine ecosystems before finally settling on the seafloor is best addressed with preventative measures.

Public health plays an important role in preventing such diseases to improve individualsâ€™ quality of life. Conventional dosage schemes used in public health to cure various diseases generally lead to undesirable side effects and renders the overall treatment ineffective. For example, a required concentration of drug cannot reach the lungs using conventional methods to cure asthma. Microspheres have emerged as a confirmed drug-delivery system to cure asthma. Method: In this paper, a salbutamol-loaded poly lactic acid-co-glycolic acid-polyethylene glycol (PLGA-PEG) microsphere (SPP)-based formulation was prepared using a Buchi B-90 nanospray drier. Face-centered central composite design (CCD) was applied to optimize the spray-drying process. Results: The drug content and product yield were found to be 72%Â±0.8% and 86%Â±0.4%, respectively; drug release (91.1%) peaked for up to 12 hrs in vitro. Microspheres obtained from the spray dryer were found to be shriveled. The experiments were carried out and verified using various groups of rabbits. In our study, the particle size (8.24 Âµm) was observed to be an essential parameter for drug delivery. The in vivo results indicated that the targeting efficacy and drug concentration in the lung was higher with the salbutamol-loaded PLGA-PEG SPP formulation (1,410.1Â±10.11 Âµg/g, 15 mins), as compared to the conventional formulation (92Â±0.56 Âµg/g, 10 min). The final product was stable under 5Â°CÂ±2Â° C, 25Â°CÂ±2Â°C, and 40Â°CÂ±2Â°C/75%Â±5% relative humidity. In addition, these co-polymers have a good safety profile, as determined by testing on human alveolar basal epithelium A549 cell lines. Conclusion: Our results prove that microspheres are an alternative drug-delivery system for lung-targeted asthma treatments used in public health.

The popular phrase today, evoked at all political meetings, in all speeches and at all cocktail parties, is that by 2050, there will be more plastics than fish in the ocean. This is a simple and valid prediction naturally, since global fish stocks are fished at capacity and therefore not increasing in numberâ€”whereas the inflow of plastics into the ocean is continuous and rising. Stopping litter from entering the marine ecosystem is therefore the logical step to stop the prediction from coming true. Do we have time to wait for the international community to come together to ratify a treaty text on this, with the required years of negotiations in between, though? Granted, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) passed 13 nonbinding resolutions in December of 2017 of which one was on marine microplastics. They are still nonbinding though and without any teeth or financial instruments attached. The General Assembly, however, adopted resolution 72/249 also in December 2017, on a conference spanning a 2-year period, starting in 2018, where the end goal is to agree on a treaty on the protection of biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ). We argue in this article that, rather than waiting for a treaty that is plastics specific, a path to fast action could be to incorporate this into these negotiations, since plastic is interweaved as a substantial stressor to the system and to biodiversity in all areas of the ocean.

This study evaluates performance of nylon 6,6 nanofiber membrane (NFM) to a conventional polyvinylidene fluoride phase inverted membrane (PVDF PIM) for filtration of Chlorella vulgaris. Results show that nylon 6,6 NFM is superhydrophilic, has higher size of pore opening (0.22 vs 0.18 Î¼m) and higher surface pore density (23 vs 18 pores/Î¼m2) leading to higher permeance (1018 vs 493 L/m2hbar) and better fouling resistant. Such advantages help to outperform the filterability of PVDF PIM by showing much higher steady-state permeance (286 vs 120 L/m2hbar), with comparable biomass retention. In addition, unlike for PVDF PIM, imposing longer relaxation cycles further enhances the performance of the NFM (i.e., 178 L/m2hbar for 0.5 min and 236 L/m2hbar for 5 min). Overall findings confirm the advantages of nylon 6,6 NFM over the PVDF PIM. Such advantages can help to reduce required membrane area and specific aeration demand by enabling higher flux and lowering aeration rate. Nevertheless, developments of nylon 6,6 NFM material with respect to its intrinsic properties, mechanical strength and operational conditions of the panel can still be explored to enhance its competitiveness as a promising fouling resistant membrane material for microalgae filtration.

Microplastics may pose certain risks to marine ecosystems because they are very small in particle size, high in abundance, and ubiquitous in distribution and hence readily ingested by marine organisms, such as fish, shellfish, etc. and to wetland ecological environments, too. Recent years have witnessed rapid growth of the number of research reports about microplastics pollution the world over, but just initiation in China. In this study, the Leâ€™an River Section of the Poyang Lake, a tract of wetland, was defined as its research site and samples of sediments were collected from the wetland for analysis of content of microplastics so as to explore distribution and sources of the microplastics in the region, and provide some scientific data for studies of microplastic pollution in inland lake and river wetlands. ã€Methodã€‘This study combined field surveys and sampling for indoor analysis methods. Samples of sediments were collected from the nine sampling sites distributed in three typical sections of the region, that is,, the upper-stream of the Leâ€™an River, the tributary (the Dawu River) of the Leâ€™an River and the mid- and down-streams of the river, for microscopic, SEM-EDS and FTIR analyses. Abundance, surface morphology, composition and source of the microplastics in the sediments was determined. ã€Resultã€‘ Results show that the microplastics in the surface sediments of the region were composed mainly of those in the shape of fragment (58.3ï¼…), fiber (21.5ï¼…), films (13.8ï¼…) and foam (6.4ï¼…). The average of the 9 sampling sites in abundance of microplastics was 1 800 indÂ·kg-1,whih tended to be on the high side as compared with the findings of the researches in other areas. The average of the upstream of the Leâ€™an River, the tributary River (Dawu River) and the downstream of the Leâ€™an River, was 1 121 indÂ·kg-1, 2 871 indÂ·kg-1 and 1 366 indÂ·kg-1, respectively, forming an order of tributary &gt; upper-stream &gt; mid- and lower-streams. Source analysis of the microplastics reveals that industrial pollutants discharged from industries in the neighborhood, and plastic wastes discarded from cities and towns alongside the river and fishery activities were the major sources; SEM-EDS analysis shows that the microplastics were weathered to a varying degree with rough surface and apparent tears; And energy spectrum analysis demonstrates that onto the surface of the microplastics adsorbed were substances and elements, such as Si, Fe, Mg, O, Al, Ca, etc., which aggravated hazardness of the microplastics to the environment and the organisms therein. ã€Conclusionã€‘There are 4 kinds of microplastics in the sediments of the Leâ€™an River and the Poyang Lake, in terms of morphology, that is, are fragments, foams, films and fibers. The average abundance of microplastics in the region is 1 800 indÂ·kg-1, which is sorted to be moderate tending to be on the high side, compared with that of other regions similar in environment. The microplastics come mainly from nearby industries, residential settlements and fishery activities. The microplastics appear to be weathered to a varying degree with rough surface and obvious tears and gibbosities, which lead to expansion of their specific surface areas, and enhancement of their adsorption capacities for organic pollutants, heavy metal ions and microbes, thus aggravating their hazardness to the environment and organisms therein.

About 1.4 million cases took place with 693,900 deaths in 2012. It can occur either in colon or rectum. Thus, we aimed to develop and optimize oxaliplatin (OP) loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). Materials and methods: SLNs containing tristearin, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE), Lipoid S75, and Tween 80 was developed. Boxâ€“Behnken design was applied for optimization of SLNs and optimized formulation was selected for conjugation with folic acid (FA). Optimized formulations were evaluated for various physiochemical parameters viz., particle size (PS), zeta potential, %entrapment efficiency (EE), morphology, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Results and discussion: OP loaded uncoupled SLNs (OPSLNs) and OP loaded FA coupled SLNs (OPSLNFs) formulations revealed good EE, 49.2 Â± 0.38% and 43.5 Â± 0.59%, respectively and small PS, 146.2 Â± 4.4 nm, and 158.8 Â± 5.6 nm, respectively. XRD pattern and DSC results confirmed that OP was uniformly distributed in amorphous form within SLNs. In vitro drug release study of OPSLNs and OPSLNFs formulation revealed sustained drug release pattern of OP for up to 6 d. Anticancer activity on HT-29 cell line indicated the highest potency of OPSLNFs as compared to OPSLNs and OP solution. Conclusion: The present work illustrated the higher sensitivity of HT-29 cells to the drug entrapped in OPSLNFs as compared to OPSLNs and OP solution. Hence, this novel strategy might be a promising approach for the management of CRC.

Then, there is an increase in the social demand for appropriate policy by the government. To prepare appropriate countermeasures, it is essential to estimate the environmental damage cost of microplastics in the ocean in advance. Therefore, this study estimates willingness to pay of residents in Seoul metropolitan area in South Korea for removing the microplastics to provide the quantitative information of the environmental damage cost of microplastics in the ocean. This study employed one-and-one-half-bound dichotomous choice with spike model to collect the WTP responses data. To deal with the outliers, we assumed that the distribution of WTP is the contaminated normal distribution, which is heavy-tailed in comparison to normal distribution used in previous studies. In addition, to deal with the numerous zero WTP responses, this study employs the Bayesian censoring regression with data augmentation method. The estimate of the average yearly WTP is KRW 2845.6 (USD 2.59). Additionally, total WTP of households in Seoul metropolitan area was KRW 10.8 billion (USD 9.80 million) annually.

The health risks related with the exposure to EDs are typically underestimated, less well characterized, and not regulated to the same extent as, for example, carcinogens. The increased production and utilization of identified or suspected EDs in many different technological processes raises new challenges with respect to occupational exposure settings and associated health risks. Due to the specific profile of health risk, occupational exposure to EDs demands a new paradigm in health risk assessment, redefinition of exposure assessment, new effects biomarkers for occupational health surveillance and definition of limit values. The construction and plastics industries are among the strongest economic sectors, employing millions of workers globally. They also use large quantities of chemicals that are known or suspected EDs. Focusing on these two industries, this short communication discusses: (a) why occupational exposure to EDs needs a more specific approach to occupational health risk assessments, (b) identifies the current knowledge gaps, and (c) identifies and gives a rationale for a future occupational health paradigm, which will include ED biomarkers as a relevant parameter in occupational health risk assessment, surveillance and exposure prevention.

Aglaia elaeagnoidea, commonly known as Priyangu, is widely employed in Asian traditional medicine and pest control. Medicinal activities include anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anticancer, and anesthetic actions. Flavaglines, six cyclopenta[b]benzofurans, a cyclopenta[bc]benzopyran, a benzo[b]oxepine, and an aromatic butyrolactone showed antifungal properties, and aglaroxin A and rocaglamide were effective to control moth pests. Here, we determined the larvicidal action of A. elaeagnoidea leaf aqueous extract. Furthermore, we focused on Priyangu-mediated synthesis of Ag nanoparticles toxic to Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi. The plant extract and the nanolarvicide were tested on three mosquito vectors, following the WHO protocol, as well as on three non-target mosquito predators. Priyangu-synthesized Ag nanoparticles were characterized by spectroscopic (UV, FTIR, XRD, and EDX) and microscopic (AFM, SEM, and TEM) analyses.

Microplastic particles stimulate biofilm formation (plastisphere) throughout the water column and have the potential to affect microbial community structure if they accumulate in pelagic waters, especially enhancing the proliferation of biohazardous bacteria. To test this scenario, we simulated the inflow of treated wastewater into a temperate lake using a continuous culture system with a gradient of concentration of microplastic particles. We followed the effect of microplastics on the microbial community structure and on the occurrence of integrase 1 (int1), a marker associated with mobile genetic elements known as a proxy for anthropogenic effects on the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes. The abundance of int1 increased in the plastisphere with increasing microplastic particle concentration, but not in the water surrounding the microplastic particles. Likewise, the microbial community on microplastic was more similar to the original wastewater community with increasing microplastic concentrations. Our results show that microplastic particles indeed promote persistence of typical indicators of microbial anthropogenic pollution in natural waters, and substantiate that their removal from treated wastewater should be prioritised. Increasing microplastic concentrations allow the persistence of integrase 1 on the plastic pollutants.

In this review, the ingestion of microplastics by marine organisms, its attendant potential consequences and specific hypothetical questions for further studies are discussed. The formation of heteroaggregates in the gut of prey organisms may delay microplastic clearance, potentially increasing the chances of microplastic trophic transfer to predators. Also, the survival and energetics of keystone species at lower trophic levels are negatively affected by ingestion of microplastics, thereby raising questions about the transfer of energy and nutrients to organisms at higher trophic levels. Further, since microplastics are able to adsorb and concentrate organic pollutants up tâ€¦illion times more than the pollutant concentration in ambient waters, the ingestion of such small plastic fragments isâ€¦robable route for the entrance and biomagnification of toxic chemicals in the marine food web. However, the equilibrium state between pollutant concentration in marine organisms and that of surrounding waters makes it unclear whether the ingestion of microplastics actually increases the pollutant load of organisms. Finally, microplastic ingestion can cause endocrine disorders in adult fish, which could result in neoplasia via epigenetic programming. Therefore, microplastic pollution may bâ€¦ontributory cause of increased incidents of neoplasia in marine animals.

The study focuses, for the first time, on the existence of plastic debris in the stomach contents of some commercially important marine fishes caught from the lower Gulf of Thailand during August to November of 2017. Size and weight range of the samples were 8.5 to 37.1 cm and 8 to 133 g. Results highlighted the ingestion of plastics in the 66.67% samples (110 out of 165 samples). The plastics ingested were microplastics (79.52%) (<5 mm), mesoplastics (20.48%) (5-25 mm). No macroplastic was found during this study since the study dealt with small fishes only. Transparent color plastics were the most dominant colors found in the stomach of fishes examined. Net fibres were the major types of plastics found during this study. There was no relationship found between size of plastics and different biological features of the investigated fishes. These initial findings signify an imperative phase in exploring ecotoxicological perspectives such as the existence and impact of plastic debris on the food chain; the probable effects related to the transmission of contaminants on human health etc. Â© 2018, ALÃ–KI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Cited By :8 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The dwindling resources are in sharp contrast to the increasing demands for drinking water, irrigation of crop plants as well as industrial usage by a rapidly growing human population. Simultaneously, the available freshwater reserves are being polluted by municipal and industrial effluents, inorganic toxicants including heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants as well as personal care products and pharmaceuticals. The growing use of fertilizers and the indiscriminate application of pesticides in agriculture add to the burden of pollutants. As a result, an estimated 780 million people do not have access to clean freshwater, and about 2.2 billion lack safe sanitation. Marine ecosystems are also being polluted by terrestrial runoff, accidental spills, and plastic debris, which affect both coastal regions and open oceans. Terrestrial ecosystems are contaminated by heavy metals from mining and industry as well as organic pollutants which may be taken up by and accumulate in crop plants. Additional pollutants are air-born which may drift over hundreds or thousands of miles. Recently nanoparticles have found increasing attention since they may affect human health and cause mortality. Another stress factor is increasing solar UV radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion by anthropogenically released fluorochlorocarbons and other gaseous pollutants. The large numbers of natural and synthetic chemicals, which count in the thousands, render systematic chemical analysis of pollutants in ecosystems almost impossible. Only major classes of chemicals are being analyzed and toxic substances are often not identified. Upper limits for concentrations of toxic substances differ between countries and change over time. In addition, reactions with other substances or environmental stress factors may increase the toxicity of chemicals and multifactorial pollution may exert synergistic effects on the biota and pose a threat for human health. An alternative is the employment of bioassays. By definition, these systems do not identify the chemical nature of a pollutant but provide a warning when toxic levels exceed a threshold and pose a hazard for the ecosystem or humans. This volume discusses a multitude of bioassays based on bacteria, cell lines, invertebrates and vertebrates, unicellular or multicellular algae and plants. The endpoints cover biochemical reactions, growth, and photosynthesis as well as motility, orientation, and mortality. Modern bioassays need to be sensitive, accurate, fast, inexpensive, and easy to use. The technology and the application of these bioassays will also be discussed. Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This paper compiles the fragmented knowledge on tyre wear and tear characteristics, amounts of particles emitted, pathways in the environment, and the possible effects on humans. The estimated per capita emission ranges from 0.23 to 4.7 kg/year, with a global average of 0.81 kg/year. The emissions from car tyres (100%) are substantially higher than those of other sources of microplastics, e.g., airplane tyres (2%), artificial turf (12â€“50%), brake wear (8%) and road markings (5%). Emissions and pathways depend on local factors like road type or sewage systems. The relative contribution of tyre wear and tear to the total global amount of plastics ending up in our oceans is estimated to be 5â€“10%. In air, 3â€“7% of the particulate matter (PM2.5) is estimated to consist of tyre wear and tear, indicating that it may contribute to the global health burden of air pollution which has been projected by the World Health Organization (WHO) at 3 million deaths in 2012. The wear and tear also enters our food chain, but further research is needed to assess human health risks. It is concluded here that tyre wear and tear is a stealthy source of microplastics in our environment, which can only be addressed effectively if awareness increases, knowledge gaps on quantities and effects are being closed, and creative technical solutions are being sought. This requires a global effort from all stakeholders; consumers, regulators, industry and researchers alike. Â© 2017 by the authors.

Even though transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) provide an efficient route of drug administration, the advantages of combination chemotherapy have rarely been extended into TDDS. In the present work, a polymer capable of simultaneously encapsulating two anti-cancer drugs: 5-flurouracil (5-FU) and curcumin (CUR), and releasing them with varying kinetics as a function of the leaching solvent was developed. The prepared TDDS had two copolymers: alginate coated aminated nanodextran (ALG@AND) and chitosan coated folate decorated aminated Î²-CD nano particles (CS@FA-g-AÎ²CD). After inducing surface charges, both copolymers were coupled together by electrostatic forces. All the synthetic procedures for the preparation of TDDS were monitored using FTIR, DLS, Zeta Potential, SEM and TEM. The final TDDS was then evaluated for its solvent selectivity. Sustained release of 5-FU and CUR was observed with ethanol (EtOH) and 1-butanol (BuOH) respectively. However, these solvents could also release a small amount of the second drug which led to combinatorial therapy. The in vitro solvent selective drug permeation profiles were evaluated using Franz diffusion cell on rat skin. In order to evaluate the economic feasibility of the prepared TDDS, in vivo skin adhesion tests, skin irritation analysis, water vapour permeability and average visible transmittance were performed. Results proved that solvents could not only elute the drugs in a sustained manner, but could also act as penetration enhancers. Biological and histological studies carried out on skin and cancer cell lines suggested the potential usefulness of the prepared material in combinatorial chemotherapy.

Here, we critically review methods for sampling, isolating and identifying microplastics ingested by environmentally and laboratory exposed fish and invertebrates. We aim to draw attention to the strengths and weaknesses of the suite of published microplastic extraction and enumeration techniques. Firstly, we highlight the risk of microplastic losses and accumulation during biotic sampling and storage, and suggest protocols for mitigating contamination in the field and laboratory. We evaluate a suite of methods for extracting microplastics ingested by biota, including dissection, depuration, digestion and density separation. Lastly, we consider the applicability of visual identification and chemical analyses in categorising microplastics. We discuss the urgent need for the standardisation of protocols to promote consistency in data collection and analysis. Harmonized methods will allow for more accurate assessment of the impacts and risks microplastics pose to biota and increase comparability between studies.

Their small size makes them bioavailable to a range of organisms and studies have reported ingestion across the food chain. Few studies have demonstrated physical transfer of microplastics between organisms, and no research has assessed the ecological impacts of transferred microplastics and contaminants over different trophic levels. Contaminants associated with plastics can alter animal behaviour; thus, exploring changes in behaviour may be fundamental in understanding ecosystem effects of microplastics. This study explored the effects of microplastics and associated contaminants through the food chain in the marine intertidal zone. We exposed beach hoppers, Platorchestia smithi, to environmentally relevant concentrations of microplastics and then fed them to Krefft's frillgobies, Bathygobius krefftii, ray-finned fish that inhabit shallow coastal ecosystems. We tested fish personality to see whether there were any changes that could be attributed to trophic transfer of microplastics, as even subtle changes in behaviour can have cascading effects on other organisms and the wider ecosystem. Exploring behavioural changes in response to contaminant exposure is a developing area in ecotoxicology due to its increased sensitivity compared with the traditional LD50 approach. While gobies readily ingested contaminated beach hoppers, we detected no effect of microplastic trophic transfer on fish personality relative to control groups. While chronic exposure studies assessing a suite of behaviours are required, it is possible that the transfer of microplastics via trophic interactions does not provide an additional exposure pathway for contaminants through the food web.

One alternative to traditional antibiotics is bacteriophage (phage) therapy. Phage therapy utilizes bacteria-specific viruses to infect and kill bacteria cells. The specificity of these viruses is beneficial in that phage used for therapeutic purposes do not harm the human microbiota, nor do phage infect eukaryotic cells. It has been discovered that iron-doped apatite nanoparticles (IDANPs) significantly enhance phage killing of bacteria cells. The biocompatibility of apatite, coupled with its effectiveness as an adjuvant to enhance an alternative antibiotic therapy, makes it of interest for medical applications. Previously, researchers have encased phage in a microfluidic channel in coaxially electrospun fibers, allowing phage to remain viable after several weeks storage at 4 Â°C. Here, we have constructed a polymer fiber layer using electrospinning (ES) for delivery of IDANP adjuvants to compliment phage treatment delivery fibers. The IDANP delivery layer constructed is composed of polyethylene oxide (PEO) doped with the nanoparticles. When compared to media-only and IDANP-only controls, results show IDANPs delivered through a PEO fiber mesh remain effective at enhancement of phage infectivity.

The influence of nanoparticles on the surface morphology, physicochemical properties, crystalline structure and thermal stability of FG was investigated. The surface morphology assay showed a considerable increase in roughness parameters by incorporating the nanoparticles in FG matrix. Contact angle measurements ranged from about 45C to 60â€“97C as filler concentration increased, indicating that reinforced films had higher superficial hydrophobicity than neat FG ones. The X-ray diffraction results also suggested a higher crystallinity in FG matrix due to CSNPs nucleating effect. The glass transition of the nanocomposites was shifted to lower temperatures with respect to the pure FG. Thermal stability tended to increase in accordance with CSNPs content, in which the highest shift of degradation temperature was observed at 6% (w/w) loading content. Practical Applications: In recent years, bio-based polymers have attracted more and more attention due to growing environmental concern and decreasing reserve of fossil fuel.

Plastic debris were ubiquitous and although it presented diel trends, no other spatiotemporal patterns was showed. Larval Oxyporhamphus micropterus was the most important taxa (29.37% of the total catch), followed by Ceratoscopelus warmingii and Entomacrodus vomerianus. Exocoetidae eggs represented 41.01%. Mesopelagic fish larvae dominated the community. Myctophidae had the highest species richness (15). Four larval fish assemblages occurred: (1) night-time demersal/bathydemersal (Anguillidae, Congridae); (2) daytime mesopelagic/bathypelagic/epipelagic (Myctophidae, Cyclothone acclinidens); (3) daytime epipelagic (Exocoetidae, Coryphaena hippurus, Thunnus albacares); and (4) night-time reef and demersal (Blennidae, Pomacentridae, Lutjanidae). The dry season (lower temperature, higher chlorophyll a and higher SW wind velocity) influenced the first two assemblages. The rainy season (higher temperatures and lower NW wind velocity) influenced the last two. Nighttime abundance of dominant species in the rainy season suggests diel vertical migration nearshore. Plastics were 2.12 times more abundant than the most abundant fish larvae. Comparable amounts of larvae and plastics in the water column increase the chances of interaction between these two compartments and might disturb the local marine food web and promote the transfer of microplastic from one habitat to another, especially when smaller taxa contaminated by ingested fragments are preyed by migratory animals such as marine birds and tuna. A study around the area concluded that at least a part of the plastic debris can have local source due to fishing activities. Small-scale oceanographic mechanisms such as the interaction between the topography and currents (SEC and EUC) seem to be responsible for the retention of fish eggs, fish larvae and plastics around SPSPA.

Samples were collected in the central Mediterranean Sea between 2010 and 2014. Plastics ingested belonged to small microplastics (0.2 - 2 mm), large microplastics (2 - 5 mm) and mesoplastics (5 - 25 mm), having mainly clear colors. Their frequency of occurrence in stomachs was equal to 2.7%, but it increases to 5.8% if only migratory species are considered. The higher number of plastics was found in E. risso and H. benoiti (5 in both species). The plastic ingestion may represent a risk for vertical migrant lanternfishes due to the increase in buoyancy. Ecotoxicological aspects linked to the potential effects of contaminants on lanternfish biology and to the transfer of pollutants throughout the marine trophic web up to top predators should be deepened.

MSCs were seeded onto GMPs of varying crosslinking densities and sizes to investigate their role on influencing MSC differentiation and aggregation. The MSC-seeded GMPs were then encapsulated in poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogels and cultured in serum-free, growth factor-free osteochondral medium. Non-seeded MSCs co-encapsulated with GMPs in the hydrogels were used as a control for comparison. Over the course of 35Â days, MSCsÂ seeded onÂ GMPs exhibited more cellâ€“cell contacts, greater chondrogenic potential, and a down-regulation of osteogenic markers compared to the controls. Although the factors of GMP crosslinking and size had nominal influence on MSC differentiation and aggregation, GMPs demonstrate potential as an adherent-substrate for improving cell delivery from hydrogel scaffolds by facilitating cellâ€“cell contacts and improving MSC differentiation.

The gastrointestinal tracts of locally fished Nile perch (Lates niloticus) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) were examined for plastics. Plastics were confirmed in 20% of fish from each species by Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. A variety of polymer types were identified with likely sources being urban waste and consumer use.

Oil pollution, wastewater, antifouling paint, ballast water and litter are all described in detail. Various sources of oil pollution exist, ranging from large accidents to small continuous leakages from, e.g., propeller shaft bearings. The behaviour of oil when it enters the sea can differ, ultimately affecting the environment. Wastewater from ships is divided into sewage and grey water, and different regulations can affect their characteristics. Fouling on ship hulls affects the drag on the ship, which increases fuel consumption when maintaining a constant speed. The various antifouling paints used today to combat fouling are described herein, and a review of the environmental implications of using these paints is provided. Ballast water contains organisms that can become invasive if released into a new geographical area. Invasive species can entail costs on the order of millions of euros. Finally, litter is discussed in this chapter. Litter is deposited in the ocean via several sources and can affect organisms over long periods of time. Plastic causes the largest litter-related problem because it does not biodegrade; such material only becomes smaller, ultimately reaching a microplastic state. Henee, litter can affect organisms in different ways. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.

Rivers close to urban centers tend to get filled with manmade waste materials, such as plastics and paper, gradually forming floating masses that further trap biological materials and animals. In addition, sewage from residences and industries, as well as rainwater runoff pour into rivers and lakes carrying solid wastes into the water bodies. As a result, the water surfaces get covered with a stagnant, thick layer of synthetic and biological refuse which kill the fish, harm animals and birds, and breed disease-carrying vectors. Such destruction of water bodies is especially common in developing countries which lack the technology or the means to clean up the rivers. A terrible consequence of plastic and synthetic waste being dumped irresponsibly into the oceans is the presence of several large floating masses of garbage in the worlds' oceans, formed by the action of gyres, or circulating ocean currents. In the Pacific Ocean, there are numerous debris fields that have been labeled the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. These patches contain whole plastic litters as well as smaller pieces of plastic, called microplastics, which are tiny fragments that were broken down by the action of waves. These waste products are ingested by animals, birds and fishes, causing death or harm. Some of the waste get washed ashore on beaches along with dead marine life. The best solution for eliminating all of the above waste management problems is by the application of MIPG systems to convert solid waste materials and contaminated water into syngas, organic fuels and raw materials. MIPG is the most efficient form of plasma gasification, which is able to process the most widest range of waste materials, while consuming only about a quarter of the energy released from the feedstock. MIPG systems can be scaled in size, power rating and wastetreatment capacity to match financial needs and waste processing requirements. MIPG systems can be set up in urban locations and on the shores of the waterbody, to filter and remove debris and contaminants and clean the water, while generating electric power to feed into the grid, and fuel or raw materials for industrial use. For eliminating the pelagic debris fields, the proposed design is to have ships fitted with waste collector and filtration systems that feeds the collected waste materials into a MIPG reactor, which converts the carbonaceous materials into syngas (H2 + CO). Some of the syngas made will be used to produce the electric power needed for running the plasma generator and onboard systems, while the remainder can be converted into methanol and other useful products through the Fischer-Tropsch process. This paper qualitatively describes the implementation schemes for the above processes, wherein MIPG technology will be used to clean up major waste problems affecting the earth's water bodies and to convert the waste into energy and raw materials in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner, while reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and the release of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.

The most abundant taxa were the clupeids Rhinosardinia bahiensis and Harengula clupeola, followed by the achirid Trinectes maculatus (78.7% of the catch). Estuarine and mangrove larvae (e.g. Anchovia clupeoides, Gobionellus oceanicus), as well as microplastics were ubiquitous. During drier months, the salt wedge reaches the upper estuary and marine larvae (e.g. Cynoscion acoupa) migrated upstream until the zones of coastal waters influence. However, the meeting of waterfronts in the middle estuary forms a barrier that retains the microplastics in the upper and lower estuary most part of the year. During the late dry season, a bloom of zooplankton was followed by a bloom of fish larvae (12.74 ind. 100 m-3) and fish eggs (14.65 ind. 100 m-3) at the lower estuary. During the late rainy season, the high freshwater inflow flushed microplastics, together with the biota, seaward. During this season, a microplastic maximum (14 items 100 m-3) was observed, followed by fish larvae maximum (14.23 ind. 100 m-3) in the lower estuary. In contrast to fish larvae, microplastics presented positive correlation with high rainfall rates, being more strictly associated to flushing out/into the estuary than to seasonal variation in environmental variables. Microplastics represented half of fish larvae density. Comparable densities in the water column increase the chances of interaction between microplastics and fish larvae, including the ingestion of smaller fragments, whose shape and colour are similar to zooplankton prey.

Methods: Thirty-two New Zealand white rabbits were used in this study. Biomaterials were surgically implanted into each rabbit in the back erector spinae and in tibia with induced defect. Polyethylene was implanted into rabbits in the control group and n-CDHA/PAA into those of the experimental group. Animals were examined at four different points in time: 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after surgery. They were euthanized after embolization. Back erector spinae muscles with the surgical implants were examined after hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining at these points in time. Tibia bones with the surgical implants were examined by X-ray and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at these points in time to evaluate the interface of the bone with the implanted biomaterials. Bone tissues were sectioned and subjected to HE, Masson, and toluidine blue staining. Results: HE staining of back erector spinae muscles at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after implantation of either n-CDHA/PAA or polyethylene showed disappearance of inflammation and normal arrangement in the peripheral tissue of implant biomaterials; no abnormal staining was observed. At 2 weeks after implantation, X-ray imaging of bone tissue samples in both experimental and control groups showed that the peripheral tissues of the implanted biomaterials were continuous and lacked bone osteolysis, absorption, necrosis, or osteomyelitis. The connection between implanted biomaterials and bone tissue was tight. The results of HE, Masson, toluidine blue staining and SEM confirmed that the implanted biomaterials were closely connected to the bone defect and that no rejection had taken place. The n-CDHA/PAA biomaterials induced differentiation of a large number of chondrocytes. New bone trabecula began to form at 4 weeks after implanting n-CDHA/PAA biomaterials, and lamellar bone gradually formed at 12 weeks and 24 weeks after implantation. Routine blood and kidney function tests showed no significant changes at 2 weeks and 24 weeks after implantation of both biomaterials. Conclusion: n-CDHA/PAA composites showed good compatibility in in vivo model. In this study, n-CDHA/PAA were found to be safe, nontoxic, and biologically active in bone repair.

We measured the mortality rate and the hatch rate of the zebrafish embryos injected with the PC-ANB particles and observed the distribution of the PC-ANB particles in the zebrafish embryos at different stages of growth development. The results show that the PC-ANB particles have negligible toxicity to the zebrafish embryos even at extrahigh concentration (1.2mgmlâˆ’1), while uncoated Ag nanoparticles, used in the form of nanospheres or nanoplates, were found to cause embryo deformation or even death. Additionally, we have investigated the distribution of the PC-ANB particles within the zebrafish in the interest of studying their behavior in the zebrafish using imaging. For this, we used the three-photon luminescence imaging technique and it has been found that the PC-ANB particles mainly assemble in the backside muscle tissues of the zebrafish, suggesting that the PC-ANB particles are mostly metabolized out after about 96 hours of growth development.

Upon damage, cartilage tissue has a low self-reparative capacity due to the lack of neural connections, vascularization, and a latent pool of stem/chondroprogenitor cells. Therefore, the healing of articular cartilage defects remains a significant clinical challenge, affecting millions of people worldwide. A plethora of biomaterials have been proposed to fabricate devices for cartilage regeneration, assuming a wide range of forms and structures, such as sponges, hydrogels, capsules, fibers, and microparticles. In common, the fabricated devices were designed taking in consideration that to fully achieve the regeneration of functional cartilage it is mandatory a well-orchestrated interplay of biomechanical properties, unique hierarchical structures, extracellular matrix (ECM), and bioactive factors. In fact, the main challenge in cartilage tissue engineering is to design an engineered device able to mimic the highly organized zonal architecture of articular cartilage, specifically its spatiomechanical properties and ECM composition, while inducing chondrogenesis, either by the proliferation of chondrocytes or by stimulating the chondrogenic differentiation of stem/chondro-progenitor cells. In this chapter we present the recent advances in the development of innovative and complex biomaterials that fulfill the required structural key elements for cartilage regeneration. In particular, multiphasic, multiscale, multilayered, and hierarchical strategies composed by single or multiple biomaterials combined in a welldefined structure will be addressed. Those strategies include biomimetic scaffolds mimicking the structure of articular cartilage or engineered scaffolds as models of research to fully understand the biological mechanisms that influence the regeneration of cartilage tissue.

Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a highly qualified tool to assess products and systems and has an increasing extent been applied to ENMs. However, still only 29 case studies on LCA of ENMs have been published in journals and this article investigates these studies. Generally, data on production of ENMs as well as the coverage of the life cycle are limited. In particular, within use and disposal stages data are scarce due to many unknowns regarding the potential release and fate of ENMs/ENPs to and in the environment. This study investigates the sensitivity of case studies with respect to ecotoxicity impacts through a quantification of the potential ecotoxicity impacts to algae, daphnia and fish as a result of direct release of Ag and TiO 2 ENPs (mainly &lt;200 nm in nominal diameter size) from various ENM products to the freshwater compartment. It was found that Ag and TiO2 release, from 1 g Ag or TiO2 ENM product, poses up to ca. 3.5 orders of magnitude higher ecotoxicity impact than the production of 1 g polymer (PP, PE and PET average) or 1 Wh of grid mix electricity from Scandinavia. ENMs from Ag had higher ecotoxic impact than those from TiO2 and there was a linear regression between Ag ENM content in the considered products and the potential ecotoxicity impacts to the freshwater species, according to release of total Ag during use (mainly washing).

The most commonly believed cause and most frequently studied aspect of AD is the aggregation of beta amyloid (AÎ²), both as soluble AÎ² and in the form of extracellular plaque. Treatment options are limited mainly due to the inability of drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier. Nanoparticulate drug carriers that have been targeted to the brain are able to pass through by virtue of their size, surface potential, surface coatings (e.g., polyethylene glycol, polysorbate), surface decoration with ligands or antibodies attached toward the receptors on the blood-brain barrier.

Infections following internal fixation in orthopaedic trauma can cause osteomyelitis in 22-66% of cases and, if uncontrolled, the mortality rate can be as high as 2%. We characterize a procedure for the synthesis of antimicrobial and biocompatible poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA) and poly-ethyleneglycol (PEG) bioscaffolds designed to degrade and absorb at a controlled rate. The bioscaffold architecture aims to provide a suitable substrate for the controlled release of silver nanoparticles (SNPs) to reduce bacterial growth and to aid the proliferation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) for tissue-engineering applications. The fabricated bioscaffolds were characterized by scanning transmission microscope (SEM) and it showed that the addition of tncreasing concentrations of SNPs results in the formation of dendritic porous channels perpendicular to the axis of precipitation. The antimicrobial properties of these porous bioscaffolds were tested according to a modified ISO 22196 standard across varying concentrations of biomass-mediated SNPs to determine an efficacious antimicrobial concentration. The bioscaffolds reduced the Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli viable colony-forming units by 98.85% and 99.9%, respectively, at an antimicrobial SNPs concentration of 2000ppm. Human ASCs were seeded on bioscaffolds and cultured in vitro for 20days to study the effect of SNPs concentration on the viability of cells. SEM analysis and the metabolic activity-based fluorescent dye, AlamarBlueÂ®, demonstrated the growth of cells on the efficacious antimicrobial bioscaffolds. The biocompatibility of in vitro leached silver, quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), proved non-cytotoxic when tested against hASCs, as evaluated by MTT assay.

A significant proportion of this is known to culminate as waste in the marine environment, though estimates vary as to the true extent. Of this, microplastics, defined as barely visible particles that can pass through a 500 Î¼m sieve, and composed of either virgin resin pellets or fragments of larger plastic debris, are now known to be an increasing component found both within marine sediments and the water column. Whilst the mechanisms by which such microplastics impact upon marine ecosystems have been documented there is an urgent need to quantify the magnitude of the problem, as well as to consider how best to manage the threat of rising levels of microplastics in the marine environment. This study determined the levels of microplastics present within the Solent estuarine complex in the UK, focusing specifically on the water column. A plankton net trawl survey was carried out, with samples analysed allowing for a qualification of the nature of the microplastics found; and in turn an identification of possible impacts. Overall the study identified significant quantities of plastics, ranging in colour and shape, with key local sources attributed to be wastewater treatment plants and the numerous boat yards found in the estuary. In eliciting the extent of a local problem that will undoubtedly be felt more widely in the marine environment, this paper also considers the challenges and difficulties inherent in trying to manage or control microplastics, as well as highlighting some potential mechanisms by which this could be pursued.","Export Date: 13 June 2021 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Contaminants released by these activities may eventually end up in the lake water, sediments and biota. For more than 40 years, the International Commission for Lake Geneva Protection (Commission Internationale pour la Protection des Eaux du LÃ©man), and research institutes located around the lake, look after these contaminants by following the evolution of analytical technics. This review particularly focuses on the evolution of the lake contamination by mercury, PCBs, pesticides, drugs and some emerging pollutants. Mercury and PCBs were the first contaminants detected in sediments in the 1970s. These contaminants were particularly targeted because of their propensity to bioaccumulate in organisms and biomagnify in the food chain, and because of their high ecotoxicity. If the contamination of fish by mercury seems controlled with values âˆ¼10 times lower than the legal limits, PCBs still pose problems for fatty fish such as Arctic char (Salvinus alpinus). Improved techniques for analyzing organic products revealed the presence in the waters of more than one hundred pesticides and thirty pharmaceuticals. In addition, contamination of Foramsulfuron in 2005, from industry, has almost reached the legal limit for drinking water. This review shows that the contamination of the lake over the last 40 years has evolved with the growing presence of many contaminants, either by the release of new substances or by improving analytical techniques. Monitoring of water quality is essential to act early enough to reduce inputs in the lake. And special vigilance must be maintained for both 'old' pollutants (Hg, PCBs) and emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals, microplastics, and products of industrial synthesis.","Cited By :7 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Here, we describe an algorithm that automatically minimizes the standard deviation in a series of related ion peaks with varying numbers of charges. The algorithm assumes that the mass is invariant and allows the determination of the correct charge state in a peak series. The analysis results in a periodic pattern, which can be interpreted as a harmonic oscillator, when the minimum standard deviation of a charge state series is found.We observed that a mass resolution of much less than 1 000 in the acquired mass spectra is sufficient to achieve a correct charge state assignment. Moreover, the boundaries of mixed species can be identified by examining the loss of periodicity in the pattern of the analysis. We tested our algorithm successfully on novel spectra and on spectra reported in the literature with sample masses up to several million Dalton, e.g., viral particles, polyethylene glycol polymers, and polystyrene nanoparticles.

Over the past few years, in the USA, there has been a huge increase in the use of fillers, especially for hyaluronic acid (400% in 2004). The causes of this increase have been the greater tolerability of this reabsorbable filler with respect to the others, and its prolonged efficacy in time due to chemical modifications of its molecular structure. In our study, we report the results of a double-blind comparative study between Puragen (latestgeneration hyaluronic acid with double cross-linking) and Captique (second generation hyaluronic acid with single cross-linking), in the treatment of nasolabial folds. Each patient received Puragen in one nasolabial fold and Captique in the contralateral fold, at random. Clinical efficacy was assessed independently by the investigator and the patient 2, 4 and 6 months after baseline or when the optimal cosmetic result was obtained. The tolerability assessment was made by the patient (using a daily diary to record any adverse events) for 2 weeks after each treatment, and by the operator 2, 4, and 6 months after baseline. Sixty-eight patients completed follow up at 6 months. From the results obtained in this study, Puragen remained stably in the treated tissues even after 6 months while less satisfactory results were obtained with Captique. The term ""filler"", in the field of plastic surgery and aesthetic medicine, refers to the vast and heterogeneous group of substances that can be applied by various injection techniques to fill wrinkles and skin sag for aesthetic and curative purposes. Over the past few years, there has been an unstoppable spread of these products in the field of plastic surgery, due to the ever-growing need for techniques that ensure high efficacy but minimum invasiveness. To eliminate blemishes caused by age, fillers currently represent a coded method. They are ever-increasingly refined and designed to meet the many needs in the field of plastic surgery, their use has increased by 25% over the past year and their growth since the year 2000 has been estimated at about 200% . The use of fillers is also indicated for a certain number of diseases in which they play a functional and curative, as well as an aesthetic role. In fact, they are used to correct inherited or traumatic defects of the soft tissues of the face, to cure patients suffering from scleroderma, progressive facial hemiatrophy, facial paralysis and finally, to treat patients suffering from lipodystrophy following treatment with antiretroviral drugs (1). Other indications for their use are represented by unilateral paralysis of the vocal cords, increase in size of the lips and soft palate in patients with labiopalatine cleft, anophthalmia and enophthalmos, and penis augmentation (2-4). The greatest demand for fillers, however, comes from patients with defects or disorders due to skin aging andlor photoaging (5). They are thus used to fill the lacrimal canaliculus/pit, remodel the shape and raise the tip of the nose, fill nasolabial folds and labial conmiissures, fill the cheeks and raise the zygomas, remodel the mandibular profile, rejuvenate the neck, increase andlor underline the profile and the labial contour. Numerous clinical results and studies conducted on animals have demonstrated a short and long-term efficacy according to the chemical structure and the surface characteristics of the microparticles making up the skin fillers. On the market there are various types of fillers that may be classified as reabsorbable (with temporary effect) and non-reabsorbable (with semi-permanent and permanent effect). Research is permanently oriented towards the discovery of new products that reach the ""ideal filler"" objective. Today, those that come the closest are those based on hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid (HA) was isolated for the first time in 1934 by Meyer and Palmer from the vitreous body of the eye of a cow (6). They found a substance containing two saccharidic fractions, one of which was HA.","Cited By :8 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",,

However, for nanoparticles the relation may not be strictly due to surface chemistry: The cumulative projected area of the particles may reflect the degree to which the inner or outer surface of the macrophage is shielded from other objects or molecules. We apply this alternative interpretation to in vitro measurements of macrophage uptake of 26-nm-diameter fluorescent beads and to in vivo data presented in a classic inhalation toxicology paper on nano-sized TiO 2 particles. In their paper, OberdÃ¶rster et al. ( Environ. Health Perspect. 102[suppl. 5]:173-179, 1994) reported that following inhalation exposure to 20-nm or 250-nm TiO 2 particles, the half-times for alveolar clearance of polystyrene test particles were proportional to square centimeters of TiO 2 particle surface per million macrophages; macrophage toxicity from TiO 2 particle surface was assumed to be the cause of the decrease in the clearance rate of polystyrene test particles. When TiO 2 particle projected area was incorporated into the in vivo macrophage dosimetry calculations, particle projected areas ranged in value from covering only a fraction (0.1) of the macrophage surface to covering the cell surface 4 times over. The observed decrease in macrophage mediated alveolar clearance of polystyrene test particles was directly related to the potential for TiO 2 particles to mask the surface of the macrophage - a possibility that was visualized in vitro with confocal laser scanning microscopy.

Early results show high promise for use of carbon nanofibers to enhance the physical properties, including electrical conductivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, strength, and modulus, of polymer composites. An artifact of high volume methods of production for carbon nanofibers and nanotubes is that fibers are generated in an entangled (""birdnested"") form, and are difficult to separate into a uniform dispersion throughout the matrix polymer during compounding. In order to disperse other nanoparticle additives such as carbon black or nanoclays, high shear mixing is frequently used; however, when applied to carbon nanofibers, the aspect ratio of the fibers may be seriously compromised, reducing their reinforcement value. As a result, the currently observed physical properties for carbon nanofiber reinforced polymers represent only a small fraction of the values predicted by theory. In this study, methods of low shear melt processing were explored to create masterbatch compounds of uniformly dispersed carbon nanofibers in which the high aspect ratio of the as-grown carbon nanofiber is preserved. The method used to disperse the nanofibers was based on emerging techniques for long fiberreinforced thermoplastics1 (LFT's). LFT's are reinforced with discontinuous fibers having a length on the order of millimeters to centimeters. Properties of LFT's have been shown to fall in the gap between the those of glass mat thermoplastics and continuous carbon fiber reinforced polymers. Extruders have been designed and successfully used for LFT's, resulting in higher tensile strength and tensile modulus over compounds of similar loading produced with traditional extruders. However, the relatively high shear engendered in the polymer by these devices is too aggressive for retention of aspect ratio in carbon nanofibers. Also the high cost of extruder equipment, on the order of $1 million, limits use of such methods to high volume applications such as automotive parts production. As an alternative, this work focuses on a novel piston blender process has been developed at the Delft University of Technology, Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, The Netherlands, demonstrating LFT's with tensile strength improvements in polyamide, polypropylene, and other thermoplastics.2 The concept of the piston blender is to simply use heated rotating rods to mix fiber into the polymer, with very low shear forces, thus minimizing the breakage of reinforcement. Samples containing PyrografÂ®-III carbon nanofibers nylon 6 were made using the piston blender, and then examined for microstructure, tensile properties, and shear properties and compared to the database under development for CNF reinforced polymer composites. Of particular interest are fiber-matrix interface, fiber distribution, and porosity. An electrical resistivity was 1.1 Â± 0.2 Î©-cm at 4.9 v% was achieved, which compared favorably to previously compounded samples using higher shear techniques.

The long-term effects of biodegradable microcapsules in mammals are relatively well studied, but this is not the case for non-biodegradable microcapsules, which may be even more generally applicable for physiological measurements. In the current study, we introduced non-biodegradable polyelectrolyte microcapsules coated with polyethylene glycol (PMs-PEG) into the circulatory system of zebrafish to assess their long-term effects on fish internal organs with histopathologic analysis. Implantation of PMs-PEG was not associated with the formation of microclots or thrombi in thin capillaries; thus, the applied microcapsules had a low aggregation capacity. The progression of the immune response to the implant depended on the time and the abundance of microparticles in the tissues. We showed that inflammation originated from recognition and internalization of PMs-PEG by phagocytes. These microcapsule-filled immune cells have been found to migrate through the intestinal wall into the lumen, demonstrating a possible mechanism for partial microparticle elimination from fish. The observed tissue immune response to PMs-PEG was local, without a systemic effect on the fish morphology. The most pronounced chronic severe inflammatory reaction was observed near the injection site in renal parenchyma and within the abdominal cavity since PMs-PEG were administered with kidney injection. Blood clots and granulomatosis were noted at the injection site but were not found in the kidneys outside the injection site. Single microcapsules brought by blood into distal organs did not have a noticeable effect on the surrounding tissues. The severity of noted pathologies of the gills was insufficient to affect respiration. No statistically significant alterations in hepatic morphology were revealed after PMs-PEG introduction into fish body. Overall, our data demonstrate that despite they are immunogenic, non-biodegradable PMs-PEG have low potential to cause systemic effects if applied in the minimal amount necessary for detection of fluorescent signal from the microcapsules.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention,1 - Type of study",33996284,PMC8106396

Zebrafish embryos were subchronically exposed to MPs (2Â mg/L), two sub-lethal concentrations of Cu (60 and 125Â Âµg/L) and binary mixtures of MPs and Cu using the same concentrations, from 2-h post fertilization until 14 days post fertilization. Lethal and sub-lethal responses (mortality, hatching, body length) were evaluated during the embryogenesis period, and locomotor, avoidance, anxiety and shoaling behaviors, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were measured at 14 dpf. The results showed that survival of larvae was reduced in groups exposed to MPs, Cu and Cu+MPs. Regarding the behavioral patterns, the higher Cu concentration and mixtures decreased significantly the mean speed, the total distance traveled and the absolute turn angle, demonstrating an adverse effect on swimming competence of zebrafish larvae. Exposure to MPs and Cu, alone or combined, also affected avoidance behavior of zebrafish, with larvae not reacting to the aversive stimulus. There was a significant inhibition of AChE activity in larvae exposed to all experimental groups, compared to the control group. Moreover, a higher inhibition of AChE was noticed in larvae exposed to MPs and both Cu+MPs groups, comparatively to the Cu alone groups. Our findings demonstrate the adverse effects of MPs, alone or co-exposed with Cu, on fish early life stages behavior.

Briefly, protein A was conjugated to chitosan-gold nanoparticles via glutaraldehyde chemistry. Then, Ag B was immobilized on the surface of a nitrocellulose membrane, which was followed by the addition of the sera sample and gold nanoprobes. The positive signals were easily detectable by naked eye. The signal intensity of this biosensor was proportional to the concentration of active anti-Echinococcus granulosus antibodies on the surface of the nanoparticles, titer of antibodies in the sera samples, and concentration of Ag B coated on the nitrocellulose membrane.

This paper briefly summarizes all the possible sources, routes, bioavailability, trophic transfer, and consequences of microplastics in fishes. The review article also intended to highlight various mitigation strategies like implementing Four R's concept (refuse, reduce, reuse, and recycle), integrated strategies, ban on single-use plastics, use bioplastics, and create behavioural changes with public awareness.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33743469,

Most of these pollutants can induce short-term, sustained or delayed impacts on developmental, physiological, and behavioral processes that are often regulated by the endocrine system in vertebrates, including fish, thus they are termed endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Physiological impacts resulting from the exposure of these vertebrates to EDCs include abnormalities in growth and reproductive development, as many of the prevalent chemicals are capable of binding the receptors to sex steroid hormones. The approaches employed to investigate the action and impact of EDCs is largely dependent on the specific life history and habitat of each species, and the type of chemical that organisms are exposed to. Aquatic vertebrates, such as fish, are among the first organisms to be affected by waterborne EDCs, an attribute that has justified their wide-spread use as sentinel species. Many fish species are exposed to these chemicals in the wild, for either short or prolonged periods as larvae, adults, or both, thus, studies are typically designed to focus on either acute or chronic exposure at distinct developmental stages. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the approaches and experimental methods commonly used to characterize the effects of some of the environmentally prevalent and emerging EDCs, including 17 Î±-ethinylestradiol, nonylphenol, BPA, phthalates, and arsenic; and the pervasive and potential carriers of EDCs, microplastics, on reproduction and growth. In vivo and in vitro studies are designed and employed to elucidate the direct effects of EDCs at the organismal and cellular levels, respectively. In silico approaches, on the other hand, comprise computational methods that have been more recently applied with the potential to replace extensive in vitro screening of EDCs. These approaches are discussed in light of model species, age and duration of EDC exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33716955,PMC7947849

A thorough assessment of their total impact on marine ecosystems thus requires that these two kinds of pollution are not considered separately. Here we compare the outcomes of two complementary, data-driven modelling approaches for microplastic dispersal and for Plastic-Related Organic Pollutants (PROPs) in the marine environment. Focusing on the Mediterranean Sea, we simulate two years of Lagrangian particle tracking to map microplastic dispersion from the most impacting sources of pollution (i.e. coastal areas, the watersheds of major rivers, and fishing activities). Our particle sources are data-informed by national census data, hydrological regimes, and vessel tracking data to account for spatial and temporal variability of mismanaged plastic waste generation. These particle-based simulations are complemented with a simulation of the dynamics of primary pollutants in the sea, obtained via an advection-diffusion Eulerian model. While providing further understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of microplastics and the dynamics of PROPs at a Mediterranean-wide scale, our results call for the development of novel integrated modelling approaches aimed at coupling the dynamics of microplastics with the chemical exchanges occurring through them, thus promoting a holistic description of marine plastic pollution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33676205,

In this study, the photodegradation of polylactic acid (PLA, a typical BP) microplastics (MPs) under ultraviolet irradiation in water for 90 days was investigated, and the toxicities of virgin and degraded PLA to infantile zebrafish were compared. The results revealed that the size of MPs was reduced from ~25.56 to ~11.22Â Âµm after degradation and nanoparticles were generated with a maximum yield of 7.13%. The formation of abundant oxygen-containing groups (i.e. CË­O and C-O-C) improved the hydrophilia and stability of MPs. Compared with pristine PLA, the efflux and detoxification of degraded PLA mediated by ABC transporters and P450 enzymes were slower, leading to higher bioaccumulation and skeletal development inhibition of zebrafish. Further, oxidative stress-triggered mitochondrial structural damage, depolarization, fission inhibition, and apoptosis were identified as crucial mechanisms underlying the elevated toxicity of PLA after degradation.

Due to the exploratory nature of many preceding studies, drawing insight about factors driving microplastic ingestion has remained difficult. It continues unknown for instance, what the importance of varying environmental microplastic concentrations is to predict ingestion rates in fish from those areas. Here we show that ingestion rates of microplastic particles (>300Â Î¼m) in the benthic round goby from the Rhine river were negligible (1 particle in 417 fish).

Our observations remained consistent, despite having collected fish from a strongly polluted site of the lower Rhine, which served as contrast to a significantly cleaner site upstream.

Our concern is driven by the fact that there has been an absence of widescale research in India despite a country with one of the longest networks of rivers and a 7500Â km long active coastline. Anthropogenic pollutants are expected to increase and the situation will further worsen when more persistent organic pollutants (POCs) and geogenic contaminants will find its sink via monsoon runoff. Studies on aquatic species including COD, daphnia magna and zebrafish suggest strong links of bio-accumulation, suspecting to a more serious situation for the coastal India where there is an almost three times increase in the density of the microplastics as the monsoon progresses. Evidences also suggests that microplastics can adsorb known carcinogens as well as endocrine disrupting chemicals leaving our aquatic life exposed to higher mortality. Our review is a first ever scientific attempt in compiling these evidences through researches done in this field to understand the risk that the major floodplains of North India are currently facing. We have adapted the theories and inferences of the available research to predict and postulate a probable mechanism that could explain the severity of the situation in India.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33223351,

Current methods to identify microplastics (MPs) are subject to the limitations of analytical techniques, and there is no full-scale method to measure MPs in organisms. In this study, Raman Tweezers and spectroscopy methods were combined and applied to identify MPs in organisms within the size range of 1-5000Â Î¼m. The abundance of small MPs (1-20Â Î¼m) was measured in crab (0.39-2.83 items/individual) and fish (0.35-3.22 items/individual). Most MPs were transparent in color and pellet shape. The proportion of small MPs (1-20Â Î¼m) was 35.77%, and analysis revealed the non-inclusion of this fraction will induce large deviations in the overall measurement. The large MPs (20-5000Â Î¼m) were identified in crab and fish with abundances ranging from 0.74-4.96 items/individual and 0.72-5.39 items/individual, respectively. Mainly fiber shape items were detected, the dominant particle size ranged from 20 to 100Â Î¼m, and most MPs were white. Polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were the main types of MPs polymers detected. Our study fills the gap to provide a new method to detect MPs in organisms below 20Â Î¼m, facilitating study of the migration and transformation of small MPs in the environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33221000,

To this end, the ultraviolet irradiation was used to simulate the MP aging in the environment. The accumulations of MPs and pharmaceuticals, and changes in enzyme activities and genes expressions in tilapia were also evaluated. Some physical properties of MPs changed during the aging process, reflected by 0.27- and 0.16-fold increases in the specific surface area and average pore volume, respectively. And more carbonyl formation was observed on the surface of aged MPs. Compared to the 14-d coexposure with virgin MPs, the MP aging increased the accumulation of PRP by 82.3% in the brain, whereas decreased the concentration of SMX by 46.1% in the gills. The stress on tilapia caused by the MPs and PRP was alleviated by the aging process, largely related to the lower neurotoxicity and reduced lipid peroxidation damages. However, the coexposure to aged MPs and SMX would result in higher inhibitions of cytochrome P450 enzymes activities. The results of the transcriptomics showed that the MP aging mainly influenced the expression of genes related to the metabolic process, immune system process, and the genetic information process in tilapia under the coexposure to MPs and pharmaceuticals. Collectively, our results suggest that the MP aging could induce complex changes in the interactive effects between MPs and pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Fulltext",33207491,

Due to the worldwide presence and persistence of microplastic debris, human exposure is inevitable. Human exposure occurs predominantly through ingestion, although dermal and inhalation exposures are probable. Microplastic single exposure studies in aquatic species and fish have shown various toxic effects including those on reproduction and survival. In addition to potential intrinsic toxicity, microplastics often have chemicals adsorbed to their surfaces. Studies report that these chemicals can have innate toxicity that is modulated by the composition of microplastics. Both the impacts of microplastics alone and co-exposures with adsorbed chemicals exhibit size dependent effects. Analysis of the current literature has revealed published studies predominantly investigate the toxicity of microplastic exposure in fish and other aquatic species, with limited knowledge about the effects in mammals and cell lines. Toxicity has been shown to vary widely between taxonomic groups, suggesting inferring human health relevance will require model systems where human routes of exposure can be mimicked. Although it may be difficult to extrapolate the results from aquatic model systems to relevant human health impacts, they may suggest effects to investigate. In order to best estimate the short- and long-term impacts of human microplastic exposure, it is imperative that studies in model systems with increased similarity to human anatomy and cellular processes be done.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33163852,PMC7644109

Particularly, microplastics (primary and secondary) are present in all environmental compartments and this poses a potential threat because of their entry into the food chain. Furthermore, microplastics can absorb numerous pollutants that can be accumulated in the human body through bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes. We carried out a systematic review using a PRISMA approach to verify the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for microplastic removal. The international databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus) were used to find published studies on efficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for microplastic removal. The search period was between January 2010 and June 2020. Over 1000 full research papers were initially selected through the use of keywords. After that, the papers were further selected by English language, title, and abstract, and duplicate papers and non-relevant papers were eliminated according to eligibility criteria. Finally, we included 15 full research papers. In each of the 15 full research papers selected, the microplastics identified were categorized by the authors for shape, size, and type of polymers identified. The characterization of the various types of microplastics was performed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) or Raman spectroscopy. We have observed how wastewater treatments plants located in different continents (Europe, Asia, North America) mostly use a primary and secondary type of treatment that allows one to reach a high percentage of microplastics removal from wastewater. Most of the wastewater treatments plants investigated reported a microplastics removal efficiency greater than 90%, but despite this, millions of microplastics continue to be released every day into the aquatic environment. Then, in the near future, efficient and common standardized protocols for monitoring MPs should be drawn up, as well as increasing the knowledge of sources and strategies to further reduce microplastics contamination of treated wastewater.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33143273,PMC7663475

Thus, fish were exposed to citrate-functionalized Î³-Fe(2)O(3) NPs (0.3 mg L(-1); 5.44 nm) alone or co-exposed to Î³-Fe(2)O(3) NPs (0.3 mg L(-1)) and GBH (65 and 130 Î¼g of glyphosate L(-1)) during 14 and 21 days. The genotoxicity (DNA damage) was analyzed by comet assay, while the mutagenicity evaluated by micronucleus test (MN test) and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENA) frequency. The co-exposure induced clastogenic (DNA damage) and aneugenic (nuclear alterations) effects on guppies in a time-dependent pattern. Fish co-exposed to NPs and GBH (130 Î¼g glyphosate L(-1)) showed high DNA damage when compared to NPs alone and control group, indicating synergic effects after 21 days of exposure. However, mutagenic effects (ENA) were observed in the exposure groups after 14 and 21 days. Results showed the potential genotoxic and mutagenic effects of maghemite NPs and GBH co-exposure to freshwater fish.

This small size indicates that the fish has difficulty in distinguishing between their food and the microplastics. Further, there was a possibility of the absorption of other pollutants by the plastics.

In the heart and vasculature, inflammatory macrophages also enhance tissue damage and propel cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: We here use in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy to evaluate quantitative noninvasive assessment of cardiac, arterial, and pulmonary macrophages using the nanotracer (64)Cu-Macrin-a 20-nm spherical dextran nanoparticle assembled from nontoxic polyglucose. RESULTS: PET imaging using (64)Cu-Macrin faithfully reported accumulation of macrophages in the heart and lung of mice with myocardial infarction, sepsis, or pneumonia. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy detected the near-infrared fluorescent version of the nanoparticle ((VT680)Macrin) primarily in tissue macrophages. In 5-day-old mice, (64)Cu-Macrin PET imaging quantified physiologically more numerous cardiac macrophages. Upon intravenous administration of (64)Cu-Macrin in rabbits and pigs, we detected heightened macrophage numbers in the infarcted myocardium, inflamed lung regions, and atherosclerotic plaques using a clinical PET/magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Toxicity studies in rats and human dosimetry estimates suggest that (64)Cu-Macrin is safe for use in humans. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicate (64)Cu-Macrin could serve as a facile PET nanotracer to survey spatiotemporal macrophage dynamics during various physiological and pathological conditions.

Therefore, in-depth knowledge of their uptake, trafficking and effects at cellular and systemic levels is essential to understand their potential impacts for aquatic species. In this work, zebrafish (Danio rerio) was used as a model and our aims were: i) to determine the distribution, uptake, trafficking, degradation and genotoxicity of polystyrene (PS) NPs of different sizes in a zebrafish cell line; ii) to study PS NPs accumulation, migration of immune cells and genotoxicity in larvae exposed to PS NPs; and iii) to assess how PS NPs condition the survival of zebrafish larvae exposed to a pathogen and/or how they impact the resistance of an immunodeficient zebrafish. Our results revealed that the cellular distribution differed depending on the particle size: the 50Â nmÂ PS NPs were more homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm and the 1Â Î¼MÂ PS NPs more agglomerated. The main endocytic mechanisms for the uptake of NPs were dynamin-dependent internalization for the 50Â nm NPs and phagocytosis for the 1Â Î¼m nanoparticles. In both cases, degradation in lysosomes was the main fate of the PS NPs, which generated alkalinisation and modified cathepsin genes expression. These effects at cellular level agree with the results inÂ vivo, since lysosomal alkalization increases oxidative stress and vice versa. Nanoparticles mainly accumulated in the gut, where they triggered reactive oxygen species, decreased expression of the antioxidant gene catalase and induced migration of immune cells. Finally, although PS NPs did not induce mortality in wild-type larvae, immunodeficient and infected larvae had decreased survival upon exposure to PS NPs. This fact could be explained by the mechanical disruption and/or the oxidative damage caused by these NPs that increase their susceptibility to pathogens.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Fulltext",33070068,

Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, but no vaccine is currently available. Interim safety and immunogenicity data about the vaccine candidate BNT162b1 in younger adults have been reported previously from trials in Germany and the United States. METHODS: In an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial conducted in the United States, we randomly assigned healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age and those 65 to 85 years of age to receive either placebo or one of two lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain; or BNT162b2, which encodes a membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The primary outcome was safety (e.g., local and systemic reactions and adverse events); immunogenicity was a secondary outcome. Trial groups were defined according to vaccine candidate, age of the participants, and vaccine dose level (10 Î¼g, 20 Î¼g, 30 Î¼g, and 100 Î¼g). In all groups but one, participants received two doses, with a 21-day interval between doses; in one group (100 Î¼g of BNT162b1), participants received one dose. RESULTS: A total of 195 participants underwent randomization. In each of 13 groups of 15 participants, 12 participants received vaccine and 3 received placebo. BNT162b2 was associated with a lower incidence and severity of systemic reactions than BNT162b1, particularly in older adults. In both younger and older adults, the two vaccine candidates elicited similar dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing geometric mean titers, which were similar to or higher than the geometric mean titer of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum samples. CONCLUSIONS: The safety and immunogenicity data from this U.S. phase 1 trial of two vaccine candidates in younger and older adults, added to earlier interim safety and immunogenicity data regarding BNT162b1 in younger adults from trials in Germany and the United States, support the selection of BNT162b2 for advancement to a pivotal phase 2-3 safety and efficacy evaluation.

We found that food quality was the major driver of Daphnia responses. When the amount of cyanobacteria increased from 5 to 95% of the diet, there was a drastic decrease in Daphnia survival (from 81Â Â±Â 15% to 24Â Â±Â 21%), juvenile size (from 1.8Â Â±Â 0.2Â mm to 1.0Â Â±Â 0.1Â mm), adult size (from 2.7Â Â±Â 0.1Â mm to 1.1Â Â±Â 0.1Â mm), and reproduction (from 13Â Â±Â 5 neonates per surviving adult to 0), but the decrease was not always linear. This was most likely due to lower availability of lipids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and sterols from the diet. Microplastic exposure did not affect Daphnia survival, size, or reproduction. Food quality had an interactive effect with temperature on fatty acid content of Daphnia. Total fatty acid content of Daphnia was almost 2-fold higher at 20Â Â°C than at 23Â Â°C when fed 50% cyanobacteria. This may have implications for higher trophic level consumers, such as fish, that depend on zooplankton for energy and essential lipids. Our findings suggest that as proportions of cyanobacteria increase, in tandem with water temperatures due to climate change, fish may encounter fewer and smaller Daphnia with lower lipid and EPA content.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",33038362,

Primary infection in pregnant sheep leads to millions of abortions and significant economic losses for the livestock industry. Moreover, infected animals constitute the main parasitic reservoir for humans. Therefore, the development of a One-health vaccine seems the best prevention strategy. Following earlier work, a vaccine constituted of total extract of Toxoplasma gondii proteins (TE) associated with maltodextrin nanoparticles (DGNP) was developed in rodents. In this study we evaluated the ability of this vaccine candidate to protect against latent and congenital toxoplasmosis in sheep. After two immunizations by either intranasal or intradermal route, DGNP/TE vaccine generated specific Th1-cellular immune response, mediated by APC-secretion of IFN-Î³ and IL-12. Secretion of IL-10 appeared to regulate this Th1 response for intradermally vaccinated sheep but was absent in intranasally-vaccinated animals. Finally, protection against latent toxoplasmosis and transplacental transmission were explored. Intranasal vaccination led to a marked decrease of brain cysts compared with the non-vaccinated group. This DGNP/TE vaccine administered intranasally conferred a high level of protection against latent toxoplasmosis and its transplacental transmission in sheep, highlighting the potential for development of such a vaccine for studies in other species.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",33013917,PMC7509486

Across all persistent organic pollutants sampled in microplastics, hopanes and phthalates were present at high concentrations while sodium and zinc were high relative to other trace metals reported.

Microplastic particles (3000Â Î¼m) of three most commonly mass-produced polymers (polystyrene - PS, polyethylene terephthalate - PET and polyethylene - PE) were applied in environmentally realistic concentrations (0.1% of sediment dry weight) in a laboratory experiment imitating the natural environment, typical for sea trout spawning grounds. The exposure of the sea trout, from fertilized eggs to mobile yolk-sac larvae, to microplastics did not affect the hatching success (the survival of embryos), hatching rate and the incubation period. Microplastics of any tested polymer type also had no adverse effect on the larvae survival, growth rate and the rate of yolk sack absorption. Similarly, no changes in frequencies of detected cytotoxicity endpoints compared to the control group were recorded. Exposure to polymer particles induced however the formation of genotoxicity endpoints (nuclear buds, micronuclei and blebbed nuclei cells). The level of total genotoxicity (Î£Gentox) in fish larvae erythrocytes increased significantly in the following sequence: PSÂ >Â PETÂ >Â PE. No significant changes in the whole body corticosterone, dehydrocorticosterone and cortisone concentrations due to exposure to microplastics were recorded, while cortisol was detected in larvae exposed to PS. Our results show that long-term, non-ingestion related exposure to microplastics does not affect development of S. trutta early life stages but may lead to genotoxic responses. PS seems to be the most hazardous among all polymers studied. This is the first study demonstrating non-ingestion related toxicity of microplastics to the early life stages of fish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Maior que 1mm,QUE: Fulltext",32927534,

In this paper, we visually evaluated plastic debris ingestion by 965 specimens of eight commercially exploited fish species from different marine habitats off the southeast-south coast of Brazil. All species ingested plastics, with pelagic animals having higher amounts, frequency of occurrence, diversity and sizes of ingested items than demersal-pelagic and demersal animals. Highest frequency of occurrence (FO%) of plastic ingestion (25.8%) was observed for the pelagic skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis (Scombridae), and lowest (5%) for the demersal bluewing searobin Prionotus punctatus (Triglidae). Microplastics predominated in all species, and fibers/lines and fragments were the main items found, possibly derived from fishing materials. The most abundant plastic colors were transparent, black and blue, and the most common polymers were polyamide and polyurethane. With the available data, no relationship between the size of the individuals and amount of ingested plastics was observed. Considering the negative impacts of plastic ingestion on marine fish, and potentially on human health due to their consumption, understanding ingestion patterns is critical for better evaluating their origin and possible causes, and consequently for helping define prevention strategies for this problem.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32916433,

This study aims to examine the distribution of plastic particles, of all sizes (micro- and small macro-plastics) in four of the major fish species of the lake and in its shoreline sediment. The gastrointestinal tracts analysis showed that 35% of the sampled fishes ingested plastic particles. The median number of particles per fish was 4 (range 1-26). Benthic (Clarias gariepinus) and benthopelagic (Cyprinus carpio and Carassius carassius) fish species were found to contain a significantly higher number of plastic particles in comparison to the planktivorous fish species (Oreochromis niloticus). More fishes ingested plastic particles in the wet compared to the dry season. The maximum plastic size (40Â mm fibre) was found in C. carpio. Estimated median mass of plastic particles in fish was 0.07 (0.0002-385.2) mg/kg_ww. Fish and sediment samples close to known potential sources of plastic particles had a higher plastic ingestion frequency (52% of the fish) and higher plastic concentration compared to the other parts of the lake. The median count and mass of plastic particles measured in sediment of the lake were 30,000 (400-124,000) particles/m(3) and 764 (0.05-36,233) mg/kg_dw, respectively, the upper limits of which exceed known effect thresholds. Attenuated total reflection (ATR) - Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that polypropylene, polyethylene and alkyd-varnish were the dominant polymers in fishes and in sediment.

Most studies have been conducted on invertebrates, and only 3 studies have been performed on vertebrates, with exposure times ranging between 30Â min and 60 days. A review of the literature revealed that the most common MPs types studied in relation to adverse impacts on immune system and reproductive success in marine species were polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE). The immune system's responses to MPs exposure varied depending on the species, with altered organismal defense mechanisms and neutrophil function observed in fish and changes in lysosomal membrane stability and apoptotic-like nuclear alterations in phagocytes reported in invertebrate species. Reproductive responses to MPs exposure, varied depending on species, but included significant reduction in gamete and oocyte quality, fecundity, sperm swimming speed, and quality of offspring. The lack of published data means that developing a clear understanding of the impact across taxonomic groups with different feeding and behavioral traits is often difficult. Further work is required to better understand the risk MPs pose to the immune and reproductive systems of marine species in order to fully evaluate the impact these ubiquitous pollutants are having on marine ecosystems and the associated goods and services they provide.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32798751,

For this, we evaluated the shape and size, and the abundance of plastics in the gastrointestinal tracts and gills of 14 fish species from 12 streams in eastern Brazilian Amazon. We used a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to compare the levels of contamination among species and between organs. Only one individual of the 68 evaluated (a small catfish Mastiglanis cf. asopos) contained no plastic particles, and no difference was found in the contamination of the gills and digestive tract. However, Hemigrammus unilineatus presented less contamination of both the gills and the digestive tract than the other species, while Polycentrus schomburgkii had less plastic in the gastrointestinal tract, whereas Crenicichla regani and Pimelodella gerii both had a larger quantity of plastic adhered to their gills in comparison with the other species. Nanoplastics and microplastics adhered most to the gills, while plastic fibers were the most common type of material overall. This is the first study to analyze plastic contamination in fish from Amazonian streams, and in addition to revealing high levels of contamination, some species were shown to possibly be more susceptible than others. This reinforces the need for further, more systematic research into the biological and behavioral factors that may contribute to the greater vulnerability of some fish species to contamination by plastics. Amazonian stream fish show contamination by plastics. The species respond differently. The smaller the particle, the easier it is to adhere to the gills.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32755795,

This plastic waste originates from land-based applications, like consumer product packaging, and is composed of high-durability polyolefins. These conventional plastics possess desirable properties, including high chemical stability, moisture barrier, and thermoplastic characteristics. Unfortunately, if these materials reach marine environments, they fragment into microplastics that cannot be biologically assimilated. The aim of this review is to investigate commercial polymers that are biodegradable in marine environments but have comparable product stability and moisture barrier properties to polyolefins. Among commercially available biopolymers, thermoplastic starches (TPS) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have been shown to biodegrade in marine environments. Moreover, these biopolymers are thermoplastics and possess similar thermoforming properties to polyolefins. At present, TPS and PHAs have limitations, including chemical instability, limited moisture barrier properties, and high production costs. To replace conventional polymers with PHAs and TPS, these properties must be improved.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32745984,PMC7399108

Np-TiO(2) can affect especially aquatic ecosystems health, including aquatic organisms such as fish. It is therefore necessary to acquire a better understanding of the effect of Np-TiO(2) on aquatic organisms. This study evaluated the biological effects of Np-TiO(2) on Danio rerio, such as survival rate and weight change and, in particular, the Ti content or retention in the intestine and liver, as well as the activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes. In addition, the structure of the intestine, kidney, and liver was investigated through histological analysis. Ninety zebrafish were used, randomly divided into three treatment-groups: a control group (fed with food without adding Np-TiO(2)) and two groups of fish fed with food containing Np-TiO(2) exposed for 7 and 14 days. The amount of Ti in the liver and intestine was measured using atomic absorption spectrophotometry coupled to a graphite furnace (GFAAS). Morphological analysis and enzyme catalase and superoxide dismutase assays were likewise performed. Ti was detected in all fish even in control group; probably Ti must have been introduced during production by the fish food industry. Structural changes were detected in fish fed with Np-TiO(2) as vacuolization and disruption of the apical cytoplasm of epithelial cells that covered the intestinal villi. Although kidney morphology appeared intact, the lumen of the proximal tubule was enlarged, and the cells of the distal tubule were vacuolated. No morphological changes in the liver were detected; however, superoxide dismutase activity decreased, suggesting that liver changes occurred at the molecular level. Thus, Np-TiO(2) causes morphological changes in the intestine, kidney, and liver of zebrafish and biochemical changes in the liver exposed for 7 and 14 days. Although not highly lethal, Np-TiO(2) in the food chain can interfere with the morphophysiology of aquatic organisms. Neither mortalities nor body weight losses were recorded among fish in all groups over the duration of the experiment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention,1 - Type of study",32745774,

In this study, the patterns of microplastic contamination in surface water and sediment from 58 sites, and living fish from 31 sites were investigated in a semi-closed bay (Laizhou Bay, China). Microplastics in Laizhou Bay were pervasively distributed, particularly in the form of fibers. Microplastic abundance exhibited no significant differences among regions in either surface waters or sediments, indicating multiple sources of microplastics pollution in the bay. Spatial hotspot (Getis-Ord Gi*) analysis demonstrated that microplastic pollution was mainly concentrated in the Laizhou-Weifang area, which in turn was mainly affected by ocean current dynamics. Although the spatial distribution of microplastics in sediments was different from surface water, it was also affected by geology, hydrogeology, and anthropogenic activities. The most common polymer in the surface waters was polyethylene terephthalate (PET), while cellophane (CP) was the most frequently observed polymer in sediment, suggesting different sinking behaviors of these microplastics. The proportion of low-density microplastics (PE and PP) in surface water was approximately 19.9%, but these microplastics accounted for only approximately 1.7% in the sediment, suggesting that low-density microplastic particles preferentially migrate to open sea. There were significant differences in shape, size and polymer type of the microplastics among surface water, sediment and biota (pÂ <Â 0.05). Cluster analysis suggested that the Gudong, Yellow River Estuary and Laizhou-Weifang regions are three sources of microplastics, which might originate from river input, plastic recycling and marine raft aquaculture. Furthermore, microplastic particle diversity was greater in sediment at offshore sites, suggesting that these sites receive microplastics from multiple sources. Our results characterize the microplastic pollution pattern, clarify the possible transfer mechanisms between different environmental media, and will provide important information for risk evaluation and pollution control in this area.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32726698,

Exosome shave emerged as crucial regulators of intercellular communication and that abundant Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are enriched within exosomes. CircRNAs are novel members of noncoding RNAs regulating cancer proliferation and progression. However, the function and regulatory mechanism of cancer-derived exosomal circRNAs in CRC remains unclear. METHODS: CRC cells-derived exosomes were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and western blot. CCK-8, wound healing and transwell assays, and flow cytometry assays were conducted to assess whether exosomes would affect the proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis of CRC cells, respectively. Moreover, we performed the RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR to identify circRNAs in exosome-stimulated CRC cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay was used to detect the cellular distribution of circPACRGL. Bioinformatic analyses (StarBase 2.0) were used to pool the miRNA targets of circPACRGL. Luciferase assays were performed to verify the direct interaction. Finally, flow cytometry was used to detect the differentiation of N1-N2 neutrophils. RESULTS: Our study identified a novel CRC-derived exosomal circRNA, circPACRGL. We found circPACRGL was significantly upregulated in CRC cells after tumor-derived exosomes addition. Moreover, circPACRGL serves as a sponge for miR-142-3p/miR-506-3p to facilitate the transforming growth factor-Î²1 (TGF-Î²1) expression. As a result, circPACRGL promoted CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as differentiation of N1 to N2 neutrophils via miR-142-3p/miR-506-3p-TGF-Î²1 axis. CONCLUSION: Our study, the first to reveal that cancer-derived exosomal circPACRGL plays an oncogenic role in CRC proliferation and metastasis, providing mechanistic insights into the roles of circRNAs in CRC progression and a valuable marker for CRC treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",32713345,PMC7384220

The spatial distribution of microplastics in water and sediments was attributed to anthropogenic discharges, flow dynamics, tidal exchanges and microplastic density. This was evidenced by significant correlations of microplastics with the river pollution index (RPI), chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solid (SS), flow velocity and the presence of different polymer types of microplastics in water and sediment. Microplastic abundance in fish was correlated to SS, pH and conductivity, indicating that these water quality variables might affect bioavailability of microplastics to fish. Concentrations of microplastics/cm length of demersal fish at a higher trophic level (Leiognathus equulus and Pomadasys argenteus) were higher than those of a benthopelagic fish (Oreochromis niloticus niloticus). The significant relationships observed suggest that collected fish might prefer to ingest long fibrous microplastics from sediments and large fragmented microplastics from water. The high levels of 3- and 4-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particularly fluoranthene and pyrene, in fish muscle revealed that the collected fish species might have a high ability to accumulate these PAHs from food and the environment. Significant relationships between some PAHs in fish and microplastic abundances in water/sediments/fish suggested that these PAHs might be accumulated by fish from contaminated microplastics.

Results showed that bacterial communities on MPs mainly originated from their surrounding seawater and sediment, with an average contribution on total MPs adherent population of 47.91% and 37.33%, respectively. Principle coordinate analysis showed that community similarity between MPs and surrounding seawater decreased with exposure time. In addition, lower average bacterial community diversity and higher relative abundances of bacteria from the genera Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas and Alteromonas on MPs than those in their surrounding seawater and sediments indicated that MPs might enrich potential pathogens and bacteria related with carbohydrate metabolism. They are responsible for the significant differences in KEGG Orthology pathways (infectious disease and carbohydrate metabolism) between MPs and seawater. The KO pathway (Infectious Diseases) associated with MPs was also significantly higher than those with feathers in the nearshore area.

Microplastics were measured from surface water, sediments and fish gastrointestinal tracts (GI) from three sites adjacent to Suva. In addition, an evaluation on the contribution from the local sewage treatment plant to MP levels was undertaken. In general, low levels of MP in water and sediments were detected, but significant differences were observed among sites. The sewage treatment plant was shown to contribute to MP levels in sediment but not in water. Species ingestion of MP was high and associated with MP in sediments. Fibres and fragments were the predominant type of MP, and fifteen different polymers were detected, with higher percentages of polyethylene, latex and polypropylene. In conclusion, MP were found in Suva coastal environment and these MP were associated to land based human activities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32275540,

However, plastic pollution remains challenging to monitor in the environment and to control under laboratory conditions, and plastic particles are often naturally or experimentally co-contaminated with diverse chemical pollutants. Therefore, our understanding of the effects of virgin MP/NP in freshwater and marine fish is still limited. Here, we performed a systematic review of the most up-to-date literature on the effects of virgin MP/NP on fish under laboratory conditions. A total of 782 biological endpoints investigated in 46 studies were extracted. Among these endpoints, 32% were significantly affected by exposure to virgin MP/NP. More effects were observed for smaller plastic particles (i.e., size â‰¤20 Î¼m), affecting fish behavioral and neurological functions, intestinal permeability, metabolism, and intestinal microbiome diversity. In addition, we propose suggestions for new research directions to lead toward innovative, robust, and scientifically sound experiments in this field. This review of experimental studies reveals that the toxicity of virgin MP/NP on fish should be more systematically evaluated using rigorous laboratory-based methods and aims toward a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of this toxicity to fish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",32202766,

In this paper, GNPs were employed as new solid support to identify drug targets of natural bioactive compound arctigenin (ARG) against fish monogenean parasite Gyrodactylus kobayashi. Before target identification, GNPs with ARG on the surface showed the ability to enter the live parasites even the nucleus or mitochondria, which made the bound compounds capable of contacting directly with target proteins located anywhere of the parasites. At the same time, chemically modified compound remained the anthelminthic efficacy against G. kobayashii. The above results both provide assurance on the reliability of using GNPs for drug target-binding specificity. Subsequently, by interrogating the cellular proteome in parasite lysate, myosin-2 and UNC-89 were identified as the potential direct target proteins of ARG in G. kobayashii. Moreover, results of RNA-seq transcriptomics and iTRAQ proteomics indicated that myosin-2 expressions were down-regulated after ARG bath treatment both in transcript and protein levels, but for UNC-89, only in mRNA level. Myosin-2 is an important structural muscle protein expressed in helminth tegument and its identification as our target will enable further inhibitor optimization towards future drug discovery. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the power of GNPs to be readily applied to other parasite drugs of unknown targets, facilitating more broadly therapeutic drug design in any pathogen or disease model.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",32070333,PMC7027246

In this study, Ginkgolide B (GB), a potent anti-Parkinsonism compound, was selected to verify the utility of NCs to effectively accumulate GB in both the blood and brain. Highly stabilized GB-NCs had small sizes, high rates of dissolution, enhanced cellular uptake and permeability. The GB-NCs could protect neurons against cytotoxicity induced by MPP(+), and showed no toxicity in zebrafish. Fluorescent imaging in zebrafish indicated high levels of the NCs in both the gut and brain. When orally administrated to rats, the GB-NCs showed higher drug plasma levels and neuronal drug distributions when compared to control groups.

A concentration of 3300Â ng/L Argovitâ„¢ and 10.6Â ng/L UTSA AgNPs for 15 and 60Â min, respectively, was 100% effective against Tetrahymena. After 60Â min of exposure to 0.25 and 0.50Â ng/L UTSA AgNPs, the number of cilia significantly reduced, there were small holes on the cell surface, and the cellular membrane was ruptured. In fish exposed to lethal (10.6Â ng/L) and higher (31.8 and 95.4Â ng/L) doses of UTSA, the AgNPs did not affect fish survival after 96Â h, and there were no signs of histopathological damage or gut microbial changes. This study is the first report on microscopic and ultrastructural changes in Tetrahymena after exposure to significantly low concentrations of UTSA AgNPs with antiprotozoal efficacy without evidence of harmful effects on fish. These results provide the basis for further studies of both pet aquarium and commercial fish that may validate these findings at a larger experimental scale, taking into account AgNPs bioaccumulation, safety for human consumption and environmental impact.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention,1 - Type of study",31877275,

Islands' exposure to such contaminants, littered over long distances in marine or terrestrial habitats, is due to the ocean currents that can transport plastic over long ranges. Here, this issue is addressed for the Easter Island ecoregion (EIE). High-resolution ocean circulation models are used with a Lagrangian particle-tracking tool to identify the connectivity patterns of the EIE with industrial fishing areas and coastline regions of the Pacific basin. Connectivity patterns for ""virtual"" particles either floating (such as buoyant macroplastics) or neutrally-buoyant (smaller microplastics) are investigated. We find that the South American shoreline between 20Â°S and 40Â°S, and the fishing zone within international waters off Peru (20Â°S, 80Â°W) are associated with the highest probability for debris to reach the EIE, with transit times under 2 years. These regions coincide with the most-densely populated coastal region of Chile and the most-intensely fished region in the South Pacific. The findings offer potential for mitigating plastic contamination reaching the EIE through better upstream waste management. Results also highlight the need for international action plans on this important issue.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31873122,PMC6927966

A semi-systematic review of studies investigating the number of microplastics found in commercially important organisms of different trophic levels suggests that microplastics do not biomagnify, and that organisms at lower trophic levels are more likely to contaminated by microplastic pollution than apex predators.

This study quantified and characterised (physically and chemically) microplastics ingested by four species of juvenile fish (viz. Oreochromis mossambicus [Peters, 1852], Terapon jarbua [ForsskÃ¥l, 1775], Ambassis dussumieri [Cuvier, 1828] and Mugil sp.), within four mangroves along the east coast of South Africa. Microplastics were isolated from whole fish using a proteinase K digestion method, and then quantified and characterised in terms of shape, chemical nature (plastic type), colour and length. Fibres (68%) and fragments (21%) were the dominant shapes found. Of the 174 fish sampled, 52% contained microplastic particles, with 0.79Â Â±Â 1.00 particles per fish. The average number of particles per fish did not differ significantly across species within sites and across sites but was higher than in juvenile fish of other species sampled in oceanic habitats. The main plastic types collected using 10Â Î¼m filters and identified with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), were rayon (70.4%), polyester (10.4%), nylon (5.2%) and polyvinylchloride (3.0%). Particle length ranged from 0.1 to 4.8Â mm, averaging 0.89Â Â±Â 0.77Â mm, but irrespective of length, particles were mostly blue in colour. This study provides evidence that juvenile fish inhabiting mangroves are consuming significant quantities of microplastics. Importantly, it should be noted that rayon, though the most abundant plastic type found, is a semi-synthetic fibre made from regenerated cellulose that is commonly reported in studies of this nature. The habitats studied serve as nurseries for numerous fish species; however, more detailed studies are needed to assess whether microplastic ingestion could compromise the health of these fish or whether these effects are dependent on species, feeding habit and/or plastic type.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31767237,

However, the effects of environmental concentrations of MPs, singly or in combination with organic pollutants, on the early development of marine fish remain unclear. In this study, fertilized eggs of marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) were exposed to polystyrene MPs (0, 2, 20, 200â€¯Î¼g/L) and/or phenanthrene (Phe, 50â€¯Î¼g/L) for 28 days. The results revealed that MPs were accumulated on the chorion and ingested by larvae from 2 days post-hatching. High levels of MPs (20 and 200â€¯Î¼g/L) decreased the hatchability, delayed the hatching time, and suppressed the growth, whereas Phe inhibited hatching and caused malformations in larvae. The presence of MPs at 20 and 200â€¯Î¼g/L did not alter the toxicity of Phe. By contrast, combined exposure to 2â€¯Î¼g/L MPs and Phe increased the hatchability by 25.8%, decreased malformation and mortality rates, and restored Phe-induced abnormal expressions of cardiac development-related genes. The reduced early developmental toxicity could be attributed to the decreased bioavailability and bioaccumulation of Phe by the low level of MPs. These findings contradicted the view that MPs would aggravate the toxicity of organic pollutants, and future studies are warranted to elucidate the ecological risks of marine MPs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Fulltext | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""mortality\nbody measurements""]}",31759759,

This review summarized the current knowledge about the bioavailability and toxicity of microplastics to fish species. By collating literatures, it can be concluded that microplastics contamination could occur in almost all types of aquatic habitats around the globe. Both field and laboratory studies suggest that fishes are very susceptible to microplastics ingestion. Compared with marine species, freshwater fishes have been less studied. Microplastics alone or in combination with other contaminants could cause various health problems to fish after exposure. There still exist some debates over the environmental relevance of the laboratory-based effect studies and the relative contribution of microplastics in increasing the exposure of fish to hazardous chemicals.

To elucidate the toxicological characteristics of NiNPs, we investigated their effects on the histopathology and oxidative states of zebrafish (Danio rerio) and compared the results with those of ionic nickel. Zebrafish exposed to four different concentrations of NiNPs or NiCl(2) for 72 hr or 7 days were subjected to histopathological analysis, and tissue samples were subjected to analyses for oxidative stress and gene expression. High concentrations of both NiNPs and NiCl(2) caused tissue damage in the gills, digestive tract, and liver. The damage was typically characterized by epithelial degeneration and necrosis in the gills, esophagus, and intestines, as well as by lipid loss and palisade pattern degradation in the liver. The damages to the gills, esophagus, and intestines were more severe after exposure to NiNPs, but exposure to NiCl(2) led to more severe liver damage. Exposure to NiNPs increased lipid peroxidation in the skin but decreased it in the liver and intestines; exposure to NiCl(2) increased lipid peroxidation in the intestines. Only exposure to NiCl(2) changed antioxidative responses, enzymatic antioxidant activities, and metallothionein gene expression. These results indicate that NiNPs, which are highly adsorptive, cause severe damage to the epithelium by physical contact with the cell surface and production of reactive oxygen spices, whereas ionic nickel, which is absorptive, affects cellular antioxidative responses by absorption into the body and delivery to the liver.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",31708531,

Bacterial infection caused by Flavobacterium columnare, the causative agent of columnaris disease, has been now identified as one of the most serious infectious diseases in farmed red tilapia and cause major financial damage to the producers. Among the effective prevention and control strategies, vaccination is one of the most effective approach. As the surface of living fish is covered by mucus and directly associated with the mucosal immunity, we therefore hypothesized that better adsorption on mucosal surfaces and more efficient vaccine efficacy could be enhanced biomimetic nanoparticles mimicking the mucoadhesive characteristic of live F. columnare. In this work, we describe an effective approach to targeted antigen delivery by coating the surface of nanoparticles with mucoadhesive chitosan biopolymer to provide ""pathogen-like"" properties that ensure nanoparticles binding on fish mucosal membrane. The physiochemical properties of nanovaccines were analyzed, and their mucoadhesive characteristics and immune response against pathogens were also evaluated. The prepared vaccines were nano-sized and spherical as confirmed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The analysis of hydrodynamic diameter and zeta-potential also suggested the successful modification of nanovaccines by chitosan as indicated by positively charged and the overall increased diameter of chitosan-modified nanovaccines. In vivo mucoadhesive study demonstrated the excellent affinity of the chitosan-modified nanovaccines toward fish gills as confirmed by bioluminescence imaging, fluorescent microscopy, and spectrophotometric quantitative measurement. Following vaccination with the prepared nanovaccines by immersion 30â€¯min, the challenge test was then carried out 30 and 60 days post-vaccination and resulted in high mortalities in the control. The relative percent survival (RPS) of vaccinated fish was greater than 60% for mucoadhesive nanovaccine. Our results also suggested that whole-cell vaccines failed to protect fish from columnaris infection, which is consistent with the mucoadhesive assays showing that whole-cell bacteria were unable to bind to mucosal surfaces. In conclusion, we could use this system to deliver antigen preparation to the mucosal membrane of tilapia and obtained a significant increase in survival compared to controls, suggesting that targeting mucoadhesive nanovaccines to the mucosal surface could be exploited as an effective method for immersion vaccination.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention,1 - Type of study",31585248,

Cuprous oxide nanoparticles (CONPs) could have not only inhibited tumor by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation of tumor cells, but also promoted wound healing. The objective of this study was to further explore the therapeutic effects of CONPs on hypertrophic scar formation in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: In vivo, a rabbit ear scar model was established on New Zealand albino rabbits. Six full-thickness and circular wounds (10 mm diameter) were made to each ear. Following complete re-epithelization observed on postoperative day 14, an intralesional injection of CONPs or 5% glucose solution was conducted to the wounds. The photo and ultrasonography of each wound were taken every week and scars were harvested on day 35 for further histomorphometric analysis. In vitro, the role of CONPs in human hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HSFs) apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated by Tunnel assay, Annexin V/PI staining, cell cycle analysis, and EdU proliferation assay. The endocytosis of CONPs by fibroblasts were detected through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS production were also detected. RESULTS: In vivo, intralesional injections of CONPs could significantly improve the scar appearance and collagen arrangement, and decreased scar elevation index (SEI).

The BBB strictly regulates the movement of molecules into and out of the brain, and therefore protects the brain from noxious agents. However, for this reason the BBB also acts as a major obstacle that prevents most therapeutic molecules from getting into the target site of the brain. Therefore, it is essential to develop an efficient and general approach to overcome the BBB and transport the drug to the targeted region. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems are emerging as a promising drug delivery platform, due to their distinct advantages of tunable biophysical properties such as surface chemistry, size, and shape leading to various biological actions (like clearance, biodistribution, and biocompatibility) in the body. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the surface and shape of nanoparticles will influence their BBB permeation efficiency. Here, we describe a series of upconversion nanoparticles with different surfaces (oleic acid-free, DNA-modified, Silica coating, and PEG-encapsulated), PEGylated UCNPs with various shapes were generated (including sphere and rod). The cellular uptake ability, biodistribution, and BBB penetration of those UCNPs were assessed in cultured cells (NSC-34 neuron- like cells) and in vivo (zebrafish models).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention,1 - Type of study",31482461,

This study investigated the accumulation of MPs in six major wild fish species (including Thryssa kammalensis, Amblychaeturichthys hexanema, Odontamblyopus rubicundus, Cynoglossus semilaevis, Chaeturichthys stigmatias and Collichthys lucidus), both in digestive and non-digestive tissues, from an important fish farm and mariculture area, Haizhou Bay, China. All fishes had items that were identified as MPs. The highest abundance of MPs was 22.21Â±1.70items/individual or 11.19Â±1.28items/g in T. kammalensis, which is filter-feeding and usually inhabits in estuary. The lowest abundance of MPs was observed in C. semilaevis (13.54Â±2.09items/individual) and C. stigmatias (1.61Â±0.56items/g). The abundance of MPs exponentially increased with the decrease of MPs size. The MPs were dominated by fiber in shape, black or grey in colour and cellophane in composition. As to different tissues, the total number of MPs on skin (800) or in gills (746) was higher than that in gut (514). In terms of skin, the abundances of MPs in three species of scaleless fish with mucus (A. hexanema, C. stigmatias and O. rubicundus) were generally higher than other three fishes with scales (C. lucidus, C. semilaevis and T. kammalensis), implying the potential high risk of scaleless fish consumption for human health in Haizhou Bay.

We investigated whether incubation of microplastics in waters with different organic load and toxic potential alters the toxicity of microplastics to crustacean Daphnia magna, fish embryos Danio rerio and plant Lemna minor. Polyethylene primary microplastics; specifically microbeads from facial scrub; were subjected to 3-weeks incubation in low affected spring water, river water, effluent from the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and municipal landfill leachate. Primary microplastics had no acute effect on D.Â magna mobility and D.Â rerio embryos development. While high organic load wastewaters; WWTP effluent and landfill leachate; showed evident toxicity for D.Â magna and D.Â rerio embryos, microplastics aged in these wastewaters had no effect. This suggests that adsorption of pollutants from wastewaters to microplastic particles was not high enough to induce acute toxicity to D.Â magna and D.Â rerio. On the contrary, primary microplastics affected the root growth of L.Â minor. Interestingly, aging of microplastics in low organic-load waters mitigated the toxicity of microplastics for L.Â minor, while microplastics aged in high-organic load waters had the same adverse effect as primary microplastics. Partly, these effects can be explained by different extent of coating on microplastics in different water samples.

In this study, bioaccumulation, biomagnification, and potential human intake of MPs in muscles and gills of five popular commercial species (3 fish, 1 crab, and 1 prawn) from the Persian Gulf were investigated. The surface structure characteristics of the material and elemental composition signatures were used to screen for likely MPs and rule out non-plastics. Among the studied species, Penaeus semisulcatus and Epinephelus coioides displayed the highest (mean 0.360 items/g muscle) and lowest (mean 0.158 items/g muscle) MPs level in their muscles, respectively. The number of extracted MPs from the gills was higher than the muscle of the analyzed species, especially when it comes to scavengers and filter feeders such as (Liza klunzingeri, Portunus armatus, and P. semisulcatus).The results of the trophic magnification factor (TMF) and biomagnification factor (BMF) calculation indicated that MPs were not biomagnified in edible parts of the marine food web of the Persian Gulf. Hence, contrary to previous belief, MPs trophic dilution occurs rather than magnification in edible parts of seafood. The assessment of human intake of MPs highlights the possible risks posed by seafood consumption to the the human population depending to a great extent on a seafood diet. Considering possible physical and chemical toxicity of MPs and their associated contaminants, routine consumption of high doses of the studied seafood should be controlled for vulnerable groups such as pregnant/lactating women and their children to ensure their safety.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",31393815,

In addition, morphological changes in zebrafish embryos induced by NMs were classified in four reaction models, allowing classification of the mode of action and toxicity of different types of NM. Revised data showed that the interaction and bioaccumulation of NMs on zebrafish embryos were associated to several toxic effects, while the detoxification process was limited. In general, NMs induced delayed hatching, circulatory changes, pigmentation and tegumentary alterations, musculoskeletal disorders and yolk sac alterations on zebrafish embryos.

The surface structures of Ag-HA, Au-HA, HA, and Ag-Au-HA were analysed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission-electron microscopy (TEM), x-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV-vis, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), elemental mapping, and laser fluorescent spectroscopy. The TEM and EDS analysis confirmed that the Ag and Au are associated with the surface of HA nanoparticle. The chemical structure of HA, Ag-HA, Au-HA, and Ag-Au-HA nanoparticles was validated by FTIR and EDS analysis. We observed that Ag and Au are associated with HA nanoparticles by electrostatic, wander wall, and electrostatic and H-bonding interaction. The effect of Ag-HA, Au-HA, and Ag-Au-HA nanoparticles on bone regeneration was confirmed by ZF JBR model. The significant growth of ZF bone regeneration was observed in Ag-Au-HA nanoparticles as compared with HA, Ag-HA, and Au-HA nanoparticles.

In this study, the combined effects of MPs and natural organic matter (NOM) on the accumulation and toxicity of copper (Cu) in zebrafish (Danio rerio) were investigated. As a result, small-size MPs could absorb more Cu than large-size MPs. The presence of NOM promoted Cu adsorption on MPs in the pH range of 6-8. Our results demonstrate that the combination of MPs and NOM increased Cu accumulation in the livers and guts in a size-depended manner. Correspondingly, the results of biochemical test showed that MPs and NOM could aggravate Cu-toxicity in the livers and guts, which is manifested in the increased levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) and metallothionein (MT) and decreased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Furthermore, the results of transcriptomic analysis suggested that such aggravation of toxicity was mainly attributed to the inhibition of Cu-ion transport and the enhanced oxidative stress. Since the co-existence of MPs and NOM in the environment is inevitable, their enhancement effects on the bioaccumulation and toxicity of other pollutants such as heavy metals deserve more attention.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome",31117014,

In order to do this, juveniles were sampled using artisanal fishing arts at two sampling locations. Basic measurements of individual fish were taken (total length, total weight, weight of the liver) and GITs were subsequently removed, digested with 30% H(2)O(2) for 5 days at 60Â°C, filtered on Whatman paper and then dried. Samples were observed with a stereomicroscope, and it was demonstrated that 100% of the individuals contained microplastic particles in their GITs. In total, 241 microplastic particles were removed from the GITs of all fish. They were categorized as fibers (60.8%), pellets (28.9%), fragments (8.6%) and laminas (1.4%), and they ranged in size from 0.98 toâ€‰>â€‰5Â mm. The average number of particles per fish was higher than that reported in previous global marine studies. Moreover, a positive correlation between the number of MPs per fish and hepatosomatic index was found, suggesting a probable stress in their health condition.

Employing polyethylene particles, the bioavailability of three MP-bound inducers of 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) with variable lipophilicity was quantitatively compared via EROD activity in RTL-W1 cells. In addition, non-cytotoxic surfactant concentrations of Pluronic F-127, rhamnolipids, sodium deoxycholate and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) supplemented to the medium were tested for their effects on pollutant desorption from MPs as well as on cellular EROD induction. Bioavailability of MP-bound pollutants was negatively correlated with lipophilicity, and all surfactants were found to modulate the cellular response towards inducers by unidentified mechanisms. After experimental correction for effects on the cellular response, all surfactants except SDS moderately increased desorption of inducer from MPs. Results on the impact of lipophilicity agree with previously published thermodynamic models, indicating that appreciable pollutant desorption from MPs may only occur for substances with comparatively low lipophilicity, the accumulation of which on MPs is negligible in the environment. However, the role of surfactants should be considered further with respect to potential effects on sorption of pollutants to and from MPs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30940555,

This review presents the evolution of scientific knowledge regarding the history and understanding of systemic and local metal toxicological concerns of hip implants designs utilizing metal-on-metal (MoM) bearing surfaces used in hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA). This analysis addresses: (1) the history of the development of MoM hip implants; (2) the clinical and toxicological rationale for introducing second-generation MoM implants in the early 2000s as an alternative to metal-on-polyethylene bearings; (3) the subsequent history regarding success and failure of second-generation MoM devices; (4) a detailed review of the history of MoM toxicology, including carcinogenic potential, metal blood levels, hypersensitivity, and release of wear particles; and (5) a review of local tissue effects and MoM patient management. We have included an analysis of MoM THA and HRA survivorship trends aggregated from over 200 studies. By around 2008, HRA continued to be a challenging procedure with variable success rates, and concurrently, some THA devices began to experience higher than expected revision rates based on annual registry reports. The unexpected THA outcomes and continued challenges with HRA devices prompted many surgeons to question the role of toxicological effects in device performance. Regarding hypersensitivity, while conversion to metal sensitized status in some MoM patients occurs based on the skin patch or lymphocyte transformation testing, there is no evidence of a causal relationship between positive test results and device failure. The weight of evidence indicates that nanoparticles released from MoM implants are cleared from the local synovial space under normal wear conditions. The available data indicate that there are no discernible increases in local or systemic tumors following CoCr alloy implantation. Systemic health effects are rarely reported in MoM implant patients and are unlikely when blood concentrations are below 300â€‰Âµg/L except when patients have specific risk factors. Over time, patient management evolved to include assays aimed at predicting implant function (blood monitoring) and soft tissue reactions (MRI and ultrasound imaging). Validation of these biomarkers as a diagnostic tool for implant function, patient pain, and, ultimately, implant survival, remains lacking. After the introduction of these biomarkers, differences in implant revision decisions emerged based on imaging abnormalities, increased serum metal ion levels, and overall clinical presentation. Discrepancies in patient management algorithms and the lack of consensus in local biological effects terminology have contributed to variability in reporting incidence, etiology, and dose effects on local tissue responses in MoM implants. This variability has contributed to a debate regarding the benefit or risk of revising asymptomatic patients. Therefore, while toxicological assessments of normal functioning MoM implants indicate that MoM implants are relatively safe because of low wear and clearance of metal, more analysis of revision data is needed in order to best inform patient management decisions, particularly for asymptomatic patients, as well as patients with minor symptoms under consideration for conservative pain management treatments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30912993,

In the prepared SiNPs-Ru composite, silicon nanoparticles synthesized by atmospheric pressure microwave-assisted synthesis served as a fluorescence energy donor, which had two-photon fluorescence properties, and tris(4,4'-dicarboxylic acid-2,2-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) dichloride (L(Ru)) acted as a fluorescence energy acceptor, which could emit red fluorescence as well as had the ability to produce singlet-oxygen for photodynamic therapy. Therefore, the synthesized SiNPs-Ru could emit red fluorescence by two-photon excitation based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer, which could effectively avoid the interference of biological autofluorescence. Fluorescence imaging tests in zebrafish and nude mice indicated that the as-prepared SiNPs-Ru could act as a new kind of fluorescence probe for fluorescence imaging in vivo. By coupling folic acid (FA) to SiNPs-Ru, the prepared composite (FA-SiNPs-Ru) could not only serve as a targeted two-photon fluorescence imaging probe but also kill cancer cells via photodynamic therapy in vitro.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",30901518,

However, the undesirable water solubility as well as the unwanted bioavailability of PU limit its application. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and characterize PU nanocrystals (PU-NCs) with enhanced oral bioavailability and improved brain accumulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). The fabricated PU-NCs were approximately spherical, with a mean size of 83.05 Â± 1.96 nm, a PDI of 0.047 Â± 0.009, a drug loading of 72.7%, and a rapid dissolution rate in vitro. Molecular dynamics simulation of PU and Pluronic F68 demonstrated the interaction energy and binding energy of -88.1 kJ/mol and -40.201 Â± 0.685 kJ/mol, respectively, indicating a spontaneous binding with van der Waals interactions. In addition, the cellular uptake and permeability of PU-NCs were significantly enhanced as compared to PU alone ( p < 0.01). Moreover, PU-NCs exerted a significant neuroprotective effect against the cellular damage induced by the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP(+)). Besides, PU-NCs demonstrated no obvious toxic effects on zebrafish, as evidenced by the unaltered morphology, hatching, survival rate, body length, and heart rate. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging revealed that intact nanocrystals were found in the intestine and brain of adult zebrafish gavaged with DiO/DiI/PU-NCs. Increased values of C(max) and AUC(0- t) were observed in the plasma of rats following oral administration of PU-NCs compared to PU suspension. Likewise, brain accumulation of PU-NCs was higher than that of PU suspension. Furthermore, PU-NCs attenuated dopamine depletion, ameliorated 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced behavioral deficits, and enhanced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites. Taken altogether, this study provides evidence that PU-NCs could be exploited as a potential oral delivery system to treat PD, by improving the poor bioavailability of PU and enhancing their delivery into the brain.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",30811206,

The ways in which stratospheric ozone depletion is directly altering climate in the southern hemisphere and the consequent extensive effects on aquatic ecosystems are also addressed. The primary objective is to synthesise novel findings over the past four years in the context of the existing understanding of ecosystem response to UV radiation and the interactive effects of climate change. If it were not for the Montreal Protocol, stratospheric ozone depletion would have led to high levels of exposure to solar UV radiation with much stronger negative effects on all trophic levels in aquatic ecosystems than currently experienced in both inland and oceanic waters. This ""world avoided"" scenario that has curtailed ozone depletion, means that climate change and other environmental variables will play the primary role in regulating the exposure of aquatic organisms to solar UV radiation. Reductions in the thickness and duration of snow and ice cover are increasing the levels of exposure of aquatic organisms to UV radiation. Climate change was also expected to increase exposure by causing shallow mixed layers, but new data show deepening in some regions and shoaling in others. In contrast, climate-change related increases in heavy precipitation and melting of glaciers and permafrost are increasing the concentration and colour of UV-absorbing dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulates. This is leading to the ""browning"" of many inland and coastal waters, with consequent loss of the valuable ecosystem service in which solar UV radiation disinfects surface waters of parasites and pathogens. Many organisms can reduce damage due to exposure to UV radiation through behavioural avoidance, photoprotection, and photoenzymatic repair, but meta-analyses continue to confirm negative effects of UV radiation across all trophic levels. Modeling studies estimating photoinhibition of primary production in parts of the Pacific Ocean have demonstrated that the UV radiation component of sunlight leads to a 20% decrease in estimates of primary productivity. Exposure to UV radiation can also lead to positive effects on some organisms by damaging less UV-tolerant predators, competitors, and pathogens. UV radiation also contributes to the formation of microplastic pollutants and interacts with artificial sunscreens and other pollutants with adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. Exposure to UV-B radiation can decrease the toxicity of some pollutants such as methyl mercury (due to its role in demethylation) but increase the toxicity of other pollutants such as some pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Feeding on microplastics by zooplankton can lead to bioaccumulation in fish. Microplastics are found in up to 20% of fish marketed for human consumption, potentially threatening food security. Depletion of stratospheric ozone has altered climate in the southern hemisphere in ways that have increased oceanic productivity and consequently the growth, survival and reproduction of many sea birds and mammals. In contrast, warmer sea surface temperatures related to these climate shifts are also correlated with declines in both kelp beds in Tasmania and corals in Brazil. This assessment demonstrates that knowledge of the interactive effects of ozone depletion, UV radiation, and climate change factors on aquatic ecosystems has advanced considerably over the past four years and confirms the importance of considering synergies between environmental factors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30810561,

METHODS: We utilized zebrafish model to assess S-DFO toxicity using following assays: mortality, teratogenicity, hatching rate, tail flicking, Acridine Orange staining for apoptosis detection, o-dianisidine staining for hemoglobin synthesis, and the level of Hsp70 as a general stress indicator. Embryos were exposed to different concentrations of S-DFO, Zinc Oxide nanoparticle (ZnO) (positive control), along with untreated control (UC). RESULTS: S-DFO showed no significant mortality nor deformities at all tested concentrations (0.0-1000â€¯Î¼M). Thus, the LC50 is expected to >1000â€¯Î¼M. 100â€¯Î¼M S-DFO treatment did not affect embryo development (as judged by hatching rate); neuromuscular activity (as judged by tail flicking); and hemoglobin synthesis.

Since the prognosis of advanced HCC remains poor, there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic approaches. Porphyrin metal-organic frameworks are a class of porous organic-inorganic hybrid functional materials with good biocompatibility. METHODS: Gadolinium-porphyrin metal-organic frameworks were used as a skeleton for folic acid (FA) conjugation to synthesize a novel type of nanoparticle, denoted as folic acid-nanoscale gadolinium-porphyrin metal-organic frameworks (FA-NPMOFs). The FA-NPMOFs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis. The biotoxicity and imaging capability of the FA-NPMOFs were determined using HepG2 cells and embryonic and larval zebrafish. The delivery and photodynamic therapeutic effect of FA-NPMOFs were explored in transgenic zebrafish with doxycycline-induced HCC. RESULTS: FA-NPMOFs were spherical in structure with good dispersion and water solubility. They showed low biotoxicity, emitted bright red fluorescence, and exhibited an excellent magnetic resonance imaging capability, both in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, the FA-NPMOFs exhibited a strong affinity for folate receptor (FR)-expressing cells and were delivered to the tumor site in a targeted manner. Moreover, HCC tumor cells were eliminated following laser irradiation. CONCLUSION: FA-NPMOFs can be used for dual-modality imaging and photodynamic therapy in HCC and show promise for use as a carrier in new therapies for HCC and other FR-positive tumors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",30587985,PMC6304077

Single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to quantify the separated particles in terms of number concentration. This method demonstrated mass recoveries of more than 90% and did not strikingly alter the median particles size. High number recoveries were calculated for CeO(2) ENPs (>84%). Particle number recoveries were poor for TiO(2) ENPs (<25%), which could be due to the interference of (48)Ca with the measured isotope (48)Ti. The method was verified using zebrafish exposed to CeO(2) ENPs to test its applicability for nanotoxicokinetic investigations. Total mass of Ce and particle number concentration of CeO(2) ENPs were measured in different tissues. Notably, the mass-based biodistribution of Ce in the tissues did not follow the number-based biodistribution of CeO(2). Moreover, the calculated mass-based bioconcentration factors showed a different pattern in comparison to the number-based bioconcentration factors.

Among these, blood-liver molecular exchange is a critical factor in biological response to NPs. However, the potential effect of SiNPs on hepatic lipid metabolism is unclear. In this study, we employed three models to attempt discover whether and how SiNPs disturb hepatic lipid metabolism in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Firstly we used ICR mice models to evaulated the effects of SiNPs on the serum and hepatic lipid levels through repeated intravenous administration, meanwhile, the protein expressions of protein markers of lipogenesis (ACC1 and FAS), the key enzyme of fatty acid Î²-oxidation, CPT1A,and leptin levels in liver were detected by western blot. For verification studies, the model organism zebrafish and cultured hepatic L02 cells were further performed. The TLR5 and adipocytokine-signaling pathway were verified. RESULTS: Inflammatory cell infiltration and mild steatosis induced by SiNPs were observed in the liver. Cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were elevated significantly in both blood serum and liver tissue, whereas the ratio of high-density:low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was markedly decreased. Protein markers of lipogenesis (ACC1 and FAS) were elevated significantly in liver tissue, whereas the key enzyme of fatty acid Î²-oxidation, CPT1A, was decreased significantly. Interestingly, leptin levels in the SiNP-treated group were also elevated markedly. In addition, SiNPs caused hepatic damage and steatosis in zebrafish and enhanced hyperlipemia in high-cholesterol diet zebrafish. Similarly, SiNPs increased the release of inflammatory cytokines (IL1Î², IL6, IL8, and TNFÎ±) and activated the TLR5-signaling pathway in hepatic L02 cells. CONCLUSION: In summary, our study found that SiNPs triggered hyperlipemia and hepatic steatosis via the TLR5-signaling pathway. This suggests that regulation of TLR5 could be a novel therapeutic target to reduce side effects of NPs in living organisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",30519016,PMC6233484

Although, chemical analysis of PS MPs revealed that particles sorb environmental contaminants (e.g., PAHs, nonylphenol and alcohol ethoxylates and others), the ingestion of relatively high doses of these PS MPs did not induce adverse hepatic stress in fish liver. Apart from small effect on redness loss in fillets of fish exposed to PS MPs, the ingestion of these particles did not affect lipid peroxidation or rancid odor development, thus did not affect fillet's quality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome",30451497,

To fill this knowledge gap, this study integrated chemical analysis and in vitro bioassays to elucidate the potential dioxin-like effects of microplastics bound DLCs. Chemical analysis results demonstrated that styrofoams possessed significantly greater DLCs than other coastal or open ocean plastic particles. This was probably due to the presence of additives and greater sorption ability of expanded polystyrene. However, styrofoams did not show as strong dioxin-like effects as predicted by the bioanalysis equivalent model in bioassays. This could be attributed to the decreased DLC bioavailability and increased competition with the presence of styrene oligomers. Besides, bioassay results also demonstrated that aging increased the associated DLC concentrations, since extra sorption from surrounding environment occurred during prolonged retention periods. Finally, it was estimated that the leaching of DLCs could induce dioxin-like effects in marine organisms under 100% (11/11) and 18% (2/11) scenarios for aged pellets and styrofoams through aqueous or dietary exposures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30339936,

The surface-modified polymersomes were synthesized and formulated resulting in paclitaxel-loaded particles of about 320 Â± 153.15 nm in size with a surface potential of 0.04 Â± 0.007 mV. After the expression and activity of MMP-9 in MCF7 cells were verified, this cell line was used for further analysis. Treatment of MCF7 cells with the polymersomes significantly reduced cell viability, this effect was abolished after addition of MMP-inhibitors, suggesting proteolytic activation. In zebrafish embryos, the polymersomes were observed in the circulation with some enrichment in liver and agglomerates in the caudal veins. Importantly, in zebrafish embryos xenografted with mKate2-expressing MCF7 cells, the amount of tumor cells, quantified by detecting the copies of the heterologously expressed fluorescent protein, significantly decreased after treatment with PDMS-PMOXA-SRL-paclitaxel polymersomes. Taken together, our data suggest that polymersomes modified with an MMP-9 labile peptide and loaded with paclitaxel can be formulated, and that these particles exert pharmacological activity upon enzymatic digestion.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 4 - Control,5 - Outcome",30274515,

Ayurveda and traditional medicine have utilised natural resources such as plants and trees as part of their regime to treat various illness and diseases with positive outcomes. One such tree is Moringa oleifera (MO). Almost all parts have shown to be effective against several ailments including cancer which was attributed to the bioactive constituents. Targeted therapies had led to the development of nanoparticles which are extremely effective in various biomedical applications due to their small size. Green synthesis of gold nanoparticles have great potential as naturally occurring plants and trees such as MO can be used in the synthesis process. The resultant gold phytonanoparticles are useful in cancer therapies with improved survival rates and quality of life.

In this study, goldfish (Carassius auratus) were exposed via diet to three types of virgin MPs material types and shapes including fibers, fragments, and pellets. After six weeks of exposure, various sub-lethal effects, but no mortality, was observed. Fish exposed to plastic showed significant weight loss compared with the control. Fibers were found in the gills, gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and feces were not likely to accumulate in the GIT. Pronounced and severe alterations were found in the livers of fish exposed to fibers. The distal intestine showed more pronounced and severe changes compared to the proximal intestine, likely due to an intake of fibers. The ingestion of fibers caused the highest frequencies of progressive and inflammatory changes in the livers and intestines. This is in accordance with the higher organ index in these organs compared to other texa. Conversely, fragments and pellets were not ingested but chewed and expelled. Chewing process resulted in damages to the jaws as ranging from slight exfoliation to deep incisions. The highest frequency of regressive and circulatory (e.g., dilated sinusoids) changes was found in fish exposed to fragments, specifically in the upper and lower jaw, and in lower jaw and liver, respectively. Together, these results demonstrate that ingestion and chewing of MPs lead to damages in various organs and tissues of the gastrointestinal system, and suggest that different materials can have drastically different impacts on fish.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Fulltext",30237044,

Plastic debris originating from land-based activities are a concerning issue as they may be fragmented in smaller pieces (microplastics, < 5â€¯mm diameter) which have an excellent potential for uptake by a large variety of animals. Here, we set out to explore the whole transcriptome profiling of Mytilus galloprovincialis associated with temporal variability of microplastics concentrations. Mussels were submitted to (i) a single 18 days-exposure to a concentration of microplastics found during pollution events (4.6Â E+5 polyethylene microbeads L(-1)), (ii) a recovery period to investigate the reversibility of microplastics effects and (iii) a repeated exposure to microplastics to evidence acclimation to microplastics pollution events. Overall, 18 days-exposure to microplastics was mostly associated with disruption of mussel global homeostasis resulting in the production of stress and immune-related proteins and as a consequence, a diminution of energy allocated to growth. During the recovery period, a contrasting response was observed with the activation of apoptotic processes and the up-regulation of immune-receptors and stress-related proteins (glutathione peroxidase, hsp70) in mussels previously exposed to microplastics. These divergent responses, suggest that the establishment of compensatory mechanism as an attempt to recover, is not sufficient to counteract physiological stress induced by the first exposure. Finally, the differences observed in gene expression between single and repeated exposures to microplastics suggest, under the experimental conditions tested, that mussels may be able to establish a stress-memory upon microplastics exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",30195903,

Overall, seven C.Â rapanouiensis (16%) individuals had ingested microplastics, most of which resembled the common planktonic prey of the fish. One microplastic was found in the gut of a fish ingested by a tuna, which indicates that trophic transfer may occur between tuna and prey. A single T.Â albacares (2%) had ingested five mesoplastics (15.2-26.3â€¯mm) that were probably not mistaken for prey items, but rather accidentally ingested during foraging on fish prey. The absence of microplastics in T.Â albacares suggests that such small particles, if transferred from the prey, do not accumulate in the relatively large digestive tract of large predators. On the other hand, larger plastic items may accumulate in the gut of tunas, to which they may induce deleterious effects that still need to be examined. However, only a small portion of the fish had ingested mesoplastics. The results of this study suggest that microplastic contamination is not an immediate threat to large predatory fish, such as T.Â albacares, along the coast of Easter Island within the South Pacific subtropical gyre.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",30172118,

Here, we investigated the presence of microplastics (MPs) in sub-surface water and in two mid-trophic level Arctic fishes collected off Northeast Greenland: the demersal bigeye sculpin, Triglops nybelini, and the pelagic polar cod, Boreogadus saida. Plastics debris were found in the water samples at a concentration of 2.4 items/m(3) Â±0.8 SD which is higher than in most seas at lower latitudes.

The crosstalk between carcinoma- associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment promotes tumor development and confers chemoresistance. In this study, we further investigated the underlying tumor-promoting roles of CAFs and the molecular mediators involved in these processes. Methods: The AOM/DSS-induced colitis-associated cancer (CAC) mouse model was established, and RNA sequencing was performed. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences were used to knock down H19. Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry. SW480 cells with H19 stably knocked down were used to establish a xenograft model. The indicated protein levels in xenograft tumor tissues were confirmed by immunohistochemistry assay, and cell apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL apoptosis assay. RNA-FISH and immunofluorescence assays were performed to assess the expression of H19 in tumor stroma and cancer nests. The AldeRed ALDH detection assay was performed to detect intracellular aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme activity. Isolated exosomes were identified by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking and Western blotting. Results: H19 was highly expressed in the tumor tissues of CAC mice compared with the expression in normal colon tissues. The up-regulation of H19 was also confirmed in CRC patient samples at different tumor node metastasis (TNM) stages. Moreover, H19 was associated with the stemness of colorectal cancer stem cells (CSCs) in CRC specimens. H19 promoted the stemness of CSCs and increased the frequency of tumor-initiating cells. RNA-FISH showed higher expression of H19 in tumor stroma than in cancer nests. Of note, H19 was enriched in CAF-derived conditioned medium and exosomes, which in turn promoted the stemness of CSCs and the chemoresistance of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, H19 activated the Î²-catenin pathway via acting as a competing endogenous RNA sponge for miR-141 in CRC, while miR-141 significantly inhibited the stemness of CRC cells. Conclusion: CAFs promote the stemness and chemoresistance of CRC by transferring exosomal H19. H19 activated the Î²-catenin pathway via acting as a competing endogenous RNA sponge for miR-141, while miR-141 inhibited the stemness of CRC cells. Our findings indicate that H19 expressed by CAFs of the colorectal tumor stroma contributes to tumor development and chemoresistance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",30083271,PMC6071523

To obtain coatings with an exceptional durability and an even higher concentration of TiO(2) NPs, a solution containing 90 wt % TiO(2) NPs and 10 wt % tetraethyl orthosilicate was prepared. These ceramic shark-skin-patterned surfaces were fabricated on a PET substrate and were quickly cured, requiring only 10 s of near infrared (NIR) irradiation. The water contact angle and the mechanical, antibacterial, and antifouling characteristics of the shark-skin-patterned surfaces were investigated as a function of TiO(2) composition. Introducing TiO(2) NPs increased the contact angle hysteresis from 30 to 100Â° on shark-skin surfaces. The hardness and modulus of the films were dramatically increased from 0.28 and 4.8 to 0.49 and 16 GPa, respectively, by creating ceramic shark-skin surfaces with 90 wt % TiO(2) NPs. The photocatalytic shark-skin-patterned surfaces reduced the attachment of Escherichia coli by âˆ¼70% compared with smooth films with the same chemical composition. By incorporating as low as 10 wt % TiO(2) NPs into the chemical matrix, over 95% E. coli and up to 80% Staphylococcus aureus were inactivated within 1 h UV light exposure because of the photocatalytic properties of TiO(2).

We quantified the number of microfibres found in the stomachs of 734 sand lance and 205 herring that had been captured by an abundant seabird, the rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata). Sampling took place on six widely-dispersed breeding colonies in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington State, USA, over one to eight years. The North Pacific Ocean is a global hotspot for pollution, yet few sand lance (1.5%) or herring (2.0%) had ingested microfibres. In addition, there was no systematic relationship between the prevalence of microplastics in the fish stomachs vs. in waters around three of our study colonies (measured in an earlier study). Sampling at a single site (Protection Island, WA) in a single year (2016) yielded most (sand lance) or all (herring) of the microfibres recovered over the 30 colony-years of sampling involved in this study, yet no microfibres had been recovered there, in either species, in the previous year. We thus found no evidence that sand lance and herring currently act as major food-web conduits for microfibres along British Columbia's outer coast, nor that the local at-sea density of plastic necessarily determines how much plastic enters marine food webs via zooplanktivores. Extensive urban development around the Salish Sea probably explains the elevated microfibre loads in fishes collected on Protection Island, but we cannot account for the between-year variation. Nonetheless, the existence of such marked interannual variation indicates the importance of measuring year-to-year variation in microfibre pollution both at sea and in marine biota.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",29655068,

Juveniles (18+ days post hatch) were exposed to MPs, or pyrene (100â€¯nM), or combination of both, and feeding rate and foraging activity (swimming) were analysed.

In the test of combined MP and pyrene exposure, we observed no effect on feeding while swimming speed decreased significantly.

RESULTS: DHA-SBT-1214 was successfully encapsulated up to 20Â mg/ml in the nanoemulsion formulation and had an average oil droplet size of 200Â nm. Using a DiR near infra-red dye encapsulated nanoemulsion, we have shown the delivery of nanoemulsion to mouse tumor region. By quantitative analysis, DHA-SBT-1214 encapsulated nanoemulsion demonstrated improved pharmacokinetic properties in plasma and different tissues as compared to its solution form. Furthermore, the nanoemulsions were stable and had slower in vitro drug release compared to its solution form. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study demonstrated effective encapsulation of the drug in a nanoemulsion and this nanoemulsion showed sustained plasma levels and enhanced tumor delivery relative to the solution form.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",29520477,PMC6151135

METHODS: Eighteen New Zealand White rabbits were used. Corneal fibrosis was produced by alkali injury. Twenty-four hours after scar formation, cornea received topically either balanced salt solution (BSS; n = 6), polyethylenimine-conjugated gold nanoparticle (PEI2-GNP)-naked plasmid (n = 6) or PEI2-GNP plasmids expressing BMP7 and HGF genes (n = 6). Donor human corneas were used to obtain primary human corneal fibroblasts and myofibroblasts for mechanistic studies. Gene therapy effects on corneal fibrosis and ocular safety were evaluated by slit-lamp microscope, stereo microscopes, quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, TUNEL, modified MacDonald-Shadduck scoring system, and Draize tests. RESULTS: PEI2-GNP-mediated BMP7+HGF gene therapy significantly decreased corneal fibrosis in live rabbits in vivo (Fantes scale was 0.6 in BMP7+HGF-treated eyes compared to 3.3 in -therapy group; P < 0.001). Corneas that received BMP7+HGF demonstrated significantly reduced mRNA levels of profibrotic genes: Î±-SMA (3.2-fold; P < 0.01), fibronectin (2.3-fold, P < 0.01), collagen I (2.1-fold, P < 0.01), collagen III (1.6-fold, P < 0.01), and collagen IV (1.9-fold, P < 0.01) compared to the -therapy corneas. Furthermore, BMP7+HGF-treated corneas showed significantly fewer myofibroblasts compared to the -therapy controls (83%; P < 0.001). The PEI2-GNP introduced >104 gene copies per microgram DNA of BMP7 and HGF genes. The recombinant HGF rendered apoptosis in corneal myofibroblasts but not in fibroblasts. Localized topical BMP7+HGF therapy showed no ocular toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Localized topical BMP7+HGF gene therapy treats corneal fibrosis and restores transparency in vivo mitigating excessive healing and rendering selective apoptosis in myofibroblasts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",29490341,PMC5822743

Present study reports the fabrication of CNPs by ionic gelation process and their characterization by different approaches. The constructed nanoparticles were successfully conjugated with eurycomanone with significant entrapment efficiency. Particle size of chitosan and chitosan conjugated eurycomanone nanoparticles were 126.2nm and 130nm respectively. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the particles were spherical in shape and well dispersed. Cross-linking between CNPs and eurycomanone (CENPs) were confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Fluorescent nanoparticles were prepared by using Rhodamine-6G dye, characterised by SEM and confirmed for conjugation by FTIR. Biodistribution of CENPs showed the presence of fluorescent nanoparticles in liver, kidney, testes and brain of C. magur. The toxicity of CENPs was evaluated by comparing the histological sections of catfish testes collected from treated and control group. No signs of toxicity were seen in testes after the delivery of CENPs. Molecular docking study revealed high spontaneous binding ability of chitosan with eurycomanone and aromatase enzyme. The study reports that CNPs can act as a stabilizing agent for eurycomanone formulation and could be a promising approach to increase the reproductive performance of the fishes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",29447967,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potency of nanoemulsions containing essential oil of Rosmarinus officinalis L.

This study was accomplished in a quantitative format through tests with diphenyl picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), cellular antioxidant activity (CCA), determination of nitric oxide production, cellular viability and anti-inflammatory activity in zebrafish. OERO's were submitted to the analysis-coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), which highlighted 1,8-cineol and camphor as major compounds. NOEROs were obtained by a low-energy method and presenting the medium size smaller than 200Â nm. The efficiency of encapsulation by spectrometry and gas chromatographic analysis was 67.61 and 75.38%, respectively. In the CCA assay, all of the samples presented percentage values of inhibition similar to the quercetin pattern, indicating antioxidant activity. In the test for determination of NOÂ·, all of the samples inhibited the production of NOÂ· when compared to LPS, and NOEROS were more effective than OEROS to 5Â Âµg/mL. In the cell viability assay, the cells remained viable after contact with the samples, demonstrating an absence of cytotoxicity. This study showed that all nanoemulsions (NECHA, NECULT, and NECOM) showed no toxicity to macrophages, besides demonstrating antioxidant activity and potentiation of the essential oil effect in the proliferation of viable fibroblasts. Nanoemulsions has also shown the ability to potentiate the anti-inflammatory action of essential oils by exerting immunomodulatory activity by inhibiting the production of the pro-inflammatory mediator nitric oxide. The results obtained with NECHA in zebrafish confirm the hypothesis that prominent terpenic compounds, alpha-pinene, 1,8-cineole, and camphor, became more available at the target sites, inhibiting the inflammatory process in this animal species.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",29404883,

However, the pathways responsible for the antioxidant capacity remain unknown. Thus, this study evaluated whether the inhibition of seric xanthine oxidase (XO) activity can be considered a pathway involved in the antioxidant capacity of nanoencapsulated TTO in fish experimentally infected with P.Â aeruginosa. Seric samples from fish infected with P.Â aeruginosa showed increased XO activity, as well as increased uric acid and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In contrast, the prophylactic treatment with nanoencapsulated TTO prevented these infection-induced alterations. Based on the evidence obtained, the upregulation of seric XO activity induced pro-oxidative effects in the serum of fish experimentally infected with P.Â aeruginosa, due to excessive formation of uric acid, which stimulates the release of ROS. This treatment was able to prevent the upregulated seric XO activity and, consequently, the excessive formation of uric acid and ROS. In summary, inhibition of seric XO activity can be considered a pathway involved in the antioxidant capacity of nanoencapsulated TTO in fish experimentally infected with P.Â aeruginosa.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",29350421,

Meanwhile, freshwater ecosystems have been threatened by elevated temperatures caused by climate change. To date, no information exists on how MPs-especially under elevated temperature conditions-affect predatory performance, digestive processes and metabolic pathways in freshwater organisms. Here, we examined MPs, elevated temperature and their combined effects on juveniles (0+ group) of an Amazonian cichlid, the discus fish (Symphysodon aequifasciatus). For 30â€¯days, fish were exposed to ambient or elevated temperatures (i.e., 28 or 31â€¯Â°C) in the absence or presence of MPs (i.e., 0 or 200â€¯Î¼g/L). The following metrics were quantified: MPs accumulation; predatory performance; and biomarkers involved in neurotransmission, digestion and energy production. The results showed that survival rate and body length were not affected by MPs, elevated temperatures or their combination. Elevated temperatures resulted in an increase in MP concentrations in fish bodies. Exposure to MPs decreased the post-exposure predatory performance (PEPP) at ambient temperatures but not at elevated temperatures. Elevated temperatures, however, had no effect on the PEPP but antagonistically interacted with MPs, leading to similar predatory performances under present and future conditions. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was only affected by MPs and decreased in the presence of MPs, indicating adverse effects in nervous and neuromuscular function and, thus, potentially in predatory performance. Trypsin activity was only influenced by MPs and decreased during exposure to MPs. Elevated temperatures or MPs alone increased the amylase activity but interacted antagonistically. Lipase activity was not influenced by either of the two stressors. In contrast, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was affected by MPs or elevated temperatures alone and decreased with both stressors. Such results indicate deficits in the digestive capabilities of early-stage S. aequifasciatus under elevated temperature conditions and especially during exposure to MPs. Electron transport system (ETS) activity was not influenced by either of the two stressors. Both elevated temperatures and MPs alone increased LDH activity; however, the interaction between the two stressors cancelled activity but was still higher than activity in present conditions. Citrate synthase (CS) activity decreased with elevated temperature but increased during exposure to MPs. Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity was only influenced by MPs and increased in the presence of MPs. Thus, S. aequifasciatus juveniles exposed to elevated temperatures and MPs not only relied on anaerobic glycolysis for energy production but also depended on aerobic metabolism in the presence of MPs. Overall, these findings suggested that MPs showed a greater impact than elevated temperatures on the predatory performance, digestion and energy production of S. aequifasciatus. Nevertheless, juvenile survival and growth were minimally impacted, and thus, S. aequifasciatus could cope with near-future temperature increases and MP exposure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Fulltext",29288934,

Microplastics failed to affect the cell viability of HKLs. In addition, they provoke very few significant effects on the main cellular innate immune activities, as decrease on phagocytosis or increase in the respiratory burst of HKLs with the highest dose of microplastics tested. Furthermore, microplastics failed to affect the expression of the selected genes on sea bass or seabream, except the nrf2 which was up-regulated in seabream HKLs incubated with the highest doses. Present results seem to suggest that continue exposure of fish to PVC or PE microplastics could impair fish immune parameters probably due to the oxidative stress produced in the fish leucocytes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,3 - Intervention",29274535,

In these applications, the ability to preserve or destroy a biomaterial is directly dependent on its temperature history. Thus, thermal measurement and modeling are necessary to either avoid or induce the injury required. In this review paper, we will first define and discuss thermal conductivity and calorimetric measurements of biomaterials in the cryogenic (<-40 Â°C), subzero (<0 Â°C), hypothermic (<37 Â°C), and hyperthermic (>37 Â°C) regimes. For thermal conductivity measurements, we review the use of 3Ï‰ and laser flash techniques for measurement of thermal conductivity in thin (1 Î¼m-2 mm thick), anisotropic, and/or multilayered tissues. At the nanoscale, we review the use of pump-probe and scanning probe methods to measure thermal conductivity at short temporal scales (10 ps-100 ns) and spatial scales (1 nm-1 Î¼m), particularly in the coating and surrounding medium around metallic nanoparticles (1 nm-20 nm). For calorimetric techniques, we review differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which is intrinsically at the microscale (e.g., tissue pieces or millions of cells in media). DSC is used with large sample mass (âˆ¼3-100 mg) over wide temperature ranges (-180 to 750 Â°C) with low-temperature scanning rates (<750 Â°C/min). The need to assess smaller samples at higher rates has led to the development of nanocalorimetry on a silicon based membrane. Here the sample weight is as low as 10 ng, thereby allowing ultra-rapid heating rates (âˆ¼1 Ã— 10(7) C/min). Finally, we discuss various opportunities that are driving the need for new micro- and nanoscale thermal measurements.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",33418696,

Their predators, white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), were exposed to clams from each treatment for 28 days. In both species, we examined bioaccumulation of PCBs and effects (i.e., immunohistochemistry, histology, behavior, condition, mortality) across several levels of biological organization. PCBs were not detected in prey or predator, and thus differences in bioaccumulation of PCBs among polymers and biomagnification in predators could not be measured. One of the main objectives of this study was to test the hypothesis that bioaccumulation of PCBs would differ among polymer types. Because we could not answer this question experimentally, a bioaccumulation model was run and predicted that concentrations of PCBs in clams exposed to polyethylene and polystyrene would be greater than PET and PVC. Observed effects, although subtle, seemed to be due to microplastics rather than PCBs alone. For example, histopathology showed tubular dilation in clams exposed to microplastics with PCBs, with only mild effects in clams exposed to PCBs alone.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Fulltext",29108004,PMC5673206

Examples of interactions include entanglement in discarded fishing items or the presence of ingested debris in digestive tracts. Plastics, including microplastics, are a form of marine debris globally distributed in coastal areas, oceanic waters and deep seas. Cetaceans which strand along the coast present a unique opportunity to study interactions between animals with macro- and microplastics. A combination of novel techniques and a review of historical data was used to complete an extensive study of cetaceans interacting with marine debris within Irish waters. Of the 25 species of marine mammals reported in Irish waters, at least 19 species were reported stranded between 1990 and 2015 (nÂ =Â 2934). Two hundred and forty-one of the stranded cetaceans presented signs of possible entanglement or interactions with fisheries. Of this number, 52.7% were positively identified as bycatch or as entangled in fisheries items, 26.6% were classified as mutilated and 20.7% could not be related to fisheries but showed signs of entanglement. In addition, 274 cetaceans were recorded as by-catch during observer programmes targeting albacore tuna. Post-mortem examinations were carried out on a total of 528 stranded and bycaught individuals and 45 (8.5%) had marine debris in their digestive tracts: 21 contained macrodebris, 21 contained microdebris and three had both macro- and microdebris. Forty percent of the ingested debris were fisheries related items. All 21 individuals investigated with the novel method for microplastics contained microplastics, composed of fibres (83.6%) and fragments (16.4%). Deep diving species presented more incidences of macrodebris ingestion but it was not possible to investigate this relationship to ecological habitat.

The present study aimed to determine whether the intestinal fate of Ag was affected by the presence of polyethylene MP beads. Ag (added as (110m)Ag) was introduced into the lumen of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) anterior/mid-intestine gut sac preparations as Ag only, Ag and MPs (co-exposure) and Ag-incubated MPs (where Ag was adsorbed to the MP). Results show that after 3Â h exposure the distribution of accumulated Ag between the four intestinal compartments (mucus layer, mucosal epithelium, muscle layer and serosal saline) was not affected by either MP condition when compared to Ag alone (pÂ >Â 0.05, One way ANOVA). Across all treatment groups mucus layer binding dominated (54.2-72.6%) whereas relatively little Ag was transported to the blood compartment (i.e. combined muscle layer and serosal saline compartments, 8.5-15.0%). Accompanying adsorption/desorption studies were performed in relevant media. Over 24Â h, 60.6Â±Â 2.9% of the available Ag in artificial freshwater adhered to the surface of the PE MPs. In pH adjusted luminal fluids (pH 2.2, 4.1, 7.4 and 9.8) that span the range of conditions encountered within the rainbow trout digestive tract, there was almost complete dissociation at acidic pHs within 3Â h (<2% remaining on MPs at both pH 2.2 and pH 4.1). Such pHs are typical of piscine stomach. Based on our finding we suggest that following the ingestion of MPs with adsorbed pollutants, desorption would occur prior to entering the site of uptake. The MPs themselves have no impact on the trans-epithelial transport of the contaminant, but the net result of the MP vector effect is to potentially introduce labile contaminant forms into the intestine.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 4 - Control",28802989,

However, it can undergo oxidation easily resulting in the formation of toxic off flavor compounds such as hydroperoxides. These compounds adversely affect the nutritional quality and may induce several stress reactions in body. To solve this problem, a new antioxidant bio-material, vanillic acid-grafted chitosan (Va-g-Ch), was synthesized and used as a wall material for microencapsulation of fish oil. The sardine oil loaded Va-g-Ch microparticles could be a potential functional food ingredient considering the numerous health benefits of fish oil, chitosan, and vanillic acid. The current study aimed to investigate the possible protective effect of sardine oil-loaded Va-g-Ch microparticles against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms. In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation was conducted using H9c2 cardiomyocytes. MTT assay revealed that effective cytoprotective effect was induced by a sample concentration of 12.5Â Î¼g/mL. Results of apoptosis by double fluorescent staining with acridine orange/ethidium bromide and caspase-3 evaluation by ELISA substantiated the above findings. Further, flow cytometric determination of membrane potential, relative expression of NF-ÎºB by PCR, and ROS determination using DCFH-DA also confirmed the protective effect of encapsulated sardine oil against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. NF-ÎºB expression was down-regulated nearly by 50% on cells treated with encapsulated sardine oil. Altogether, the results revealed that sardine oil-loaded Va-g-Ch microparticles demonstrated potential cell protection against doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,3 - Intervention",28766116,PMC5823802

Our results show limited spreading of particles within the larvae after injection during the blastula stage. This is in contrast to injection of PS particles in the yolk of 2-day old embryos, which resulted in redistribution of the PS particles throughout the bloodstream, and accumulation in the heart region. Although injection was local, the transcriptome profiling showed strong responses of zebrafish embryos exposed to PS particle, indicating a systemic response. We found several biological pathways activated which are related to an immune response in the PS exposed zebrafish larvae. Most notably the complement system was enriched as indicated by upregulation of genes in the alternative complement pathway (e.g. cfhl3, cfhl4, cfb and c9). The fact that complement pathway is activated indicates that plastic microparticles are integrated in immunological recognition processes. This was supported by fluorescence microscopy results, in which we observed co-localisation of neutrophils and macrophages around the PS particles. Identifying these key events can be a first building block to the development of an adverse outcome pathway (AOP).

This is addressed by exposing three different life stages of the zebrafish embryo in order to cover the following exposure routes: via chorion and dermal exposure; dermal exposure; oral and dermal exposure. How different nanoparticle sizes affect uptake routes was assessed by using polystyrene particles of 25, 50, 250 and 700nm. In our experimental study, we showed that particle uptake in biota is restricted to oral exposure, whereas the dermal route resulted in adsorption to the epidermis and gills only.

The particles spread through the body and eventually accumulated in specific organs and tissues such as the eyes. Particles larger than 50nm were predominantly adsorbed onto the intestinal tract and outer epidermis of zebrafish embryos.

However, its poor water solubility and rapid serum clearance impose significant barriers to delivery of SA to the brain. This work aimed to develop SA in a nanoparticle formulation that extended SA circulation in the bloodstream and consequently an increased brain uptake and thus to be potentially efficacious for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Spherical SA nanoparticles with a mean particle size of 70 nm were prepared by encapsulating SA into methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(d,l)-lactic-co-glycolic acid (mPEG-PLGA) nanoparticles (SA-NPs) with an encapsulation efficiency of âˆ¼91% and drug loading of âˆ¼28%. The in vitro release of the SA-NPs lasted for 48 h with a sustained-release pattern. Using the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell model, the results showed that first intact nanoparticles carrying hydrophobic dyes were internalized into cells, then the dyes were slowly released within the cells, and last both nanoparticles and free dyes were externalized to the basolateral side of the cell monolayer. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging in zebrafish suggested that nanoparticles were gradually dissociated in vivo with time, and nanoparticles maintained intact in the intestine and brain at 2 h post-treatment. When SA-NPs were orally administrated to rats, much higher C(max) and AUC(0-t) were observed in the plasma than those of the SA suspension. Furthermore, brain delivery of SA was much more effective with SA-NPs than with SA suspension. In addition, the SA-NPs exerted strong neuroprotective effects in zebrafish and cell culture models of PD. The protective effect was partially mediated by the activation of the protein kinase B (Akt)/glycogen synthase kinase-3Î² (Gsk3Î²) pathway. In summary, this study provides evidence that small-sized mPEG-PLGA nanoparticles may improve cross-barrier transportation, oral bioavailability, brain uptake, and bioactivity of this Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class II compound, SA.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",28247754,

Fish were exposed to one of three levels of pristine low-density polyethylene (LDPE) fragments (5, 50, or 500Â Î¼g/L) for 10 or 20 days. No significant changes were observed in any of the selected biomarkers across MP concentrations at days 10 or 20. The expression of casp9 (caspase 9, apoptosis-related cysteine protease), casp3a (caspase 3, apoptosis-related cysteine protease a) and cat (catalase), however, were significantly lower in the larvae sampled at day 20 than day 10.

Because toxicants (termed here ""co-contaminants"") can sorb to MPs, there is potential for MPs to alter co-contaminant bioavailability. Our objective was to demonstrate sorption of two co-contaminants with different physicochemistries [phenanthrene (Phe), log(10)K(ow)=4.57; and 17Î±-ethinylestradiol (EE2), log(10)K(ow)=3.67] to MPs; and assess whether co-contaminant bioavailability was increased after MP settlement. Bioavailability was indicated by gene expression in larval zebrafish. Both Phe and EE2 sorbed to MPs, which reduced bioavailability by a maximum of 33% and 48% respectively. Sorption occurred, but was not consistent with predictions based on co-contaminant physicochemistry (Phe having higher log(10)K(ow) was expected to have higher sorption). Contaminated MPs settled to the bottom of the exposures did not lead to increased bioavailability of Phe or EE2. Phe was 48% more bioavailable than predicted by a linear sorption model, organism-based measurements therefore contribute unique insight into MP co-contaminant bioavailability.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome | USER-NOTES: {""elisa.calcagnotto""=>[""?""]}",28089550,

Our results show that omnivorous fish presented a higher amount of microplastic fibers than registered in herbivores and carnivores. Moreover, lower condition factors (K) were found in omnivorous specimens with higher microplastic content. We hypothesized that the type of feeding resulted in different microplastic ingestion, with species with wider range of food sources as omnivores with higher rates.

However, they are usually toxic or ineffective in serum and various strategies to improve their biocompatibility or nonfouling property have often resulted in compromised bactericidal activity. Also, star-shaped polymers are less explored than linear polymers for application as antibacterial compounds. In this paper, star polymers with poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (PDMA) as the arms and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) as the core (POSS-g-PDMA) were successfully synthesized by ATRP. The minimum inhibition concentrations (MICs) of the synthesized POSS-g-PDMA are in the range of 10-20 Î¼g/mL. POSS-g-PDMA was further modified by various hydrophilization strategies in attempting to reduce hemolysis. With quaternization of POSS-g-PDMA, the antibacterial activities of the obtained quaternary polymers are almost unchanged and the copolymers become relatively nonhemolytic. We also copolymerized sulfobetaine (SB) with POSS-g-PDMA to obtain random and block PDMA-co-PSB arm structures, where the PDMA and poly(sulfobetaine) were the cationic and zwitterionic blocks, respectively. The random cationic-zwitterionic POSS-g-(PDMA-r-PSB) copolymers showed poor antibacterial activity, while the block POSS-g-(PDMA-b-PSB) copolymers retained the antibacterial and hemolytic activity of the pristine POSS-g-PDMA. Further, the block copolymers of POSS-g-(PDMA-b-PSB) showed enhanced antifouling property and serum stability as seen by their nanoparticle size stability in the presence of serum and reduced red blood cell aggregation; the POSS-g-(PDMA-b-PSB) also somewhat retained its MIC in blood unlike the quaternized or random zwitterionic copolymers. The antibacterial kinetics study showed that Escherichia coli can be killed within 30 min by both random and block copolymers of POSS-g-(PDMA-co-PSB). Finally, our POSS star polymers showed low toxicity to zebrafish embryo and could be potentially used in aquaculture antibacterial applications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Ana""=>""Excluded"", ""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: ANA: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention | USER-NOTES: {""Querusche""=>[""survival""]}",28009508,

However, the development of PEI for in vivo applications has been hampered by the inherent problems associated with the material, particularly its cytotoxicity and the instability of the nucleic acid complexation systems formed via electrostatic interactions. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to modify PEI polymers via hydrazidation to create neutralized, stable, and multifunctional system for delivering siRNA molecules. Through substitution of the primary amino groups of PEI with neutral hydrazide groups, cross-linked nanoparticles with surface decorated with a model targeting ligands were generated. The neutral cross-linked siRNA nanoparticles not only showed favorable biocompatibility and cell internalization efficiency in vitro but also allowed for significant tissue uptake and gene silencing efficiency in zebrafish heart in vivo. Our study suggests transformation of conventional branched PEI into a neutral polymer that can lead to a new category of nonviral carriers, and the resulting functional delivery systems may be further explored for development of siRNA therapeutics for treating cardiovascular disease/injury.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 5 - Outcome,3 - Intervention",27960377,

Neutrophils play key roles in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS by promoting the inflammation and injury of the alveolar microenvironment. To date, in vivo functional approaches have been limited by the inaccessibility to the alveolar sacs, which are located at the anatomical terminal of the respiratory duct in mammals. We are the first to characterize the swim bladder of the zebrafish larva, which is similar to the mammalian lung, as a real-time in vivo model for examining pulmonary neutrophil infiltration during ALI. We observed that the delivery of exogenous materials, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Poly IC and silica nanoparticles, by microinjection triggered significant time- and dose-dependent neutrophil recruitment into the swim bladder. Neutrophils infiltrated the LPS-injected swim bladder through the blood capillaries around the pneumatic duct or a site near the pronephric duct. An increase in the post-LPS inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels coincided with the in vivo neutrophil aggregation in the swim bladder. Microscopic examinations of the LPS-injected swim bladders further revealed in situ injuries, including epithelial distortion, endoplasmic reticulum swelling and mitochondrial injuries. Inhibitor screening assays with this model showed a reduction in neutrophil migration into the LPS-injected swim bladder in response to Shp2 inhibition. Moreover, the pharmacological suppression and targeted disruption of Shp2 in myeloid cells alleviated pulmonary inflammation in the LPS-induced ALI mouse model. Additionally, we used this model to assess pneumonia-induced neutrophil recruitment by microinjecting bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients into swim bladders; this injection enhanced neutrophil aggregation relative to the control. In conclusion, our findings highlight the swim bladder as a promising and powerful model for mechanistic and drug screening studies of alveolar injuries.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",27831560,PMC5260887

However, current methods estimating the HER2-expression level are insufficient due to problem with the lack of quantification. This might result in a gap between diagnostics and therapeutics targeting HER2. Therefore, a new effective diagnostic method is needed. We developed a new immunohistochemical (IHC) technique with quantum dots (QD)-conjugated trastuzumab using single-particle imaging to quantitatively measure the HER2 expression level. Tissues from 37 breast cancer patients with available detailed clinical information were tested by IHC with QDs (IHC-QD) and the correlation with IHC with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and IHC-QD was examined. The number of QD-conjugated trastuzumab particles binding specifically to a cancer cell was precisely calculated as the IHC-QD score. The IHC-QD score in 37 cases was correlated proportionally with the score of HER2 gene copy number as assessed by FISH (RÂ =Â 0.83). When HER2 positivity was judged to be positive, the IHC-QD score with our cut-off level was exactly concordant with the FISH score with a cut-off value of 2.0. Furthermore, IHC-QDs score and time to progression (TTP) of trastuzumab therapy were well correlated in HER2-positive cases (RÂ =Â 0.69). Conversely, the correlation between FISH score and TTP was not observed. We developed a precisely quantitative IHC method using trastuzumab-conjugated QDs and single-particle imaging analysis and propose the possibility of using IHC-QDs score as a predictive factor for trastuzumab therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",27666577,PMC5083734

Here we present a broad study of municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent as a pathway for microplastic pollution to enter receiving waters. A total of 90 samples were analyzed from 17 different facilities across the United States. Averaging all facilities and sampling dates, 0.05Â Â±Â 0.024 microparticles were found per liter of effluent. Though a small value on a per liter basis, even minor municipal wastewater treatment facilities process millions of liters of wastewater each day, yielding daily discharges that ranged from âˆ¼50,000 up to nearly 15 million particles. Averaging across the 17 facilities tested, our results indicate that wastewater treatment facilities are releasing over 4 million microparticles per facility per day. Fibers and fragments were found to be the most common type of particle within the effluent; however, some fibers may be derived from non-plastic sources. Considerable inter- and intra-facility variation in discharge concentrations, as well as the relative proportions of particle types, was observed. Statistical analysis suggested facilities serving larger populations discharged more particles. Results did not suggest tertiary filtration treatments were an effective means of reducing discharge. Assuming that fragments and pellets found in the effluent arise from the 'microbeads' found in many cosmetics and personal care products, it is estimated that between 3 and 23 billion (with an average of 13 billion) of these microplastic particles are being released into US waterways every day via municipal wastewater. This estimate can be used to evaluate the contribution of microbeads to microplastic pollution relative to other sources (e.g., plastic litter and debris) and pathways (e.g., stormwater) of discharge.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",27574803,

Fish were collected along the salinity gradient of two Brazilian estuaries, the heavily impacted Paraiba Estuary and the less impacted Mamanguape Estuary, in the dry and wet seasons. The findings confirm that A. brasiliensis has generalist feeding habits and is able to change its diet under different environmental conditions. The results indicate clear spatial (i.e. along the estuarine gradient) changes in diet composition in both estuaries, but diet was also influenced by the degree of anthropogenic disturbance. During the wet season in the nutrient enriched Paraiba Estuary, when human activity was higher, the diet of A. brasiliensis was poorer and dominated by few dietary items, reflecting the potential impoverishment of prey items in this heavily disturbed system. The specimens collected in the most affected estuary also had a greater frequency of micro-plastics and parasites in their stomachs, reflecting the greater degree of human disturbance in the estuary. The present findings suggest that the diet of A. brasiliensis could be a useful indicator of changes in the ecological quality of these and other tropical estuaries of the western Atlantic Ocean.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",27328827,

The attainment of consistent effective management of these diseases can be extremely difficult, and management potential is often affected by grower reliance on highly disease-susceptible cultivars because of consumer preferences, and by environmental conditions favouring pathogen development. New and emerging bacterial disease problems (e.g. zebra chip of potato) and established problems in new geographical regions (e.g. bacterial canker of kiwifruit in New Zealand) grab the headlines, but the list of bacterial disease problems with few effective management options is long. The ever-increasing global human population requires the continued stable production of a safe food supply with greater yields because of the shrinking areas of arable land. One major facet in the maintenance of the sustainability of crop production systems with predictable yields involves the identification and deployment of sustainable disease management solutions for bacterial diseases. In addition, the identification of novel management tactics has also come to the fore because of the increasing evolution of resistance to existing bactericides. A number of central research foci, involving basic research to identify critical pathogen targets for control, novel methodologies and methods of delivery, are emerging that will provide a strong basis for bacterial disease management into the future. Near-term solutions are desperately needed. Are there replacement materials for existing bactericides that can provide effective disease management under field conditions? Experience should inform the future. With prior knowledge of bactericide resistance issues evolving in pathogens, how will this affect the deployment of newer compounds and biological controls? Knowledge is critical. A comprehensive understanding of bacterial pathosystems is required to not only identify optimal targets in the pathogens, but also optimal seasonal timings for deployment. Host resistance to effectors must be exploited, carefully and correctly. Are there other candidate genes that could be targeted in transgenic approaches? How can new technologies (CRISPR, TALEN, etc.) be most effectively used to add sustainable disease resistance to existing commercially desirable plant cultivars? We need an insider's perspective on the management of systemic pathogens. In addition to host resistance or reduced sensitivity, are there other methods that can be used to target these pathogen groups? Biological systems are variable. Can biological control strategies be improved for bacterial disease management and be made more predictable in function? The answers to the research foci outlined above are not all available, as will become apparent in this article, but we are heading in the right direction. In this article, we summarize the contributions from past experiences in bacterial disease management, and also describe how advances in bacterial genetics, genomics and host-pathogen interactions are informing novel strategies in virulence inhibition and in host resistance. We also outline potential innovations that could be exploited as the pressures to maximize a safe and productive food supply continue to become more numerous and more complex.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",27238249,PMC6638406

Here, we systematically demonstrated that the PEAL copolymer has the appropriate hydrophilicity and biosafety. The degradation rate of the PEAL films was obtained by observing changes in mass, molecular weight (Mw), Mw distribution and degradation products. The degradation rate was observed to have a highly positive correlation with the pH of the medium and negative correlation with the ratio of lactic acid to glycolic acid (LA/GA). Cytotoxicity tests indicated that the degradation products of the copolymer were non-toxic to cells. In zebrafish embryos, the PEAL nanoparticles had no obvious impact on heart rate, production of reactive oxygen species, mortality, or cell apoptosis, and they were observed to have a long circulation time.

Despite the increasing use of waterpipe smoking, there is limited data on the health effects of waterpipe smoking and there are no federal regulations regarding its use. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of waterpipe smoking on the human lung using clinical and biological parameters in young, light-use waterpipe smokers. METHODS: We assessed young, light-use, waterpipe-only smokers in comparison with lifelong nonsmokers using clinical parameters of cough and sputum scores, lung function, and chest high-resolution computed tomography as well as biological parameters of lung epithelial lining fluid metabolome, small airway epithelial (SAE) cell differential and transcriptome, alveolar macrophage transcriptome, and plasma apoptotic endothelial cell microparticles. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared with nonsmokers, waterpipe smokers had more cough and sputum as well as a lower lung diffusing capacity, abnormal epithelial lining fluid metabolome profile, increased proportions of SAE secretory and intermediate cells, reduced proportions of SAE ciliated and basal cells, markedly abnormal SAE and alveolar macrophage transcriptomes, and elevated levels of apoptotic endothelial cell microparticles. CONCLUSIONS: Young, light-use, waterpipe-only smokers have a variety of abnormalities in multiple lung-related biological and clinical parameters, suggesting that even limited waterpipe use has broad consequences on human lung biology and health. We suggest that large epidemiological studies should be initiated to investigate the harmful effects of waterpipe smoking.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",27007171,PMC5027211

While numerous peer-reviewed papers have quantified the ingestion of microplastics by marine vertebrates, relatively few studies have focused on microplastic ingestion by freshwater organisms. This study documents microplastic and manufactured fiber ingestion by bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) and longear (Lepomis megalotis) sunfish (Centrarchidae) from the Brazos River Basin, between Lake Whitney and Marlin, Texas, USA. Fourteen sample sites were studied and categorized into urban, downstream, and upstream areas. A total of 436 sunfish were collected, and 196 (45%) stomachs contained microplastics. Four percent (4%) of items sampled were debris on the macro size scale (i.e. >5Â mm) and consisted of masses of plastic, metal, Styrofoam, or fishing material, while 96% of items sampled were in the form of microplastic threads. Fish length was statistically correlated to the number of microplastics detected (pÂ =Â 0.019). Fish collected from urban sites displayed the highest mean number of microplastics ingested, followed by downstream and upstream sites. Microplastics were associated with the ingestion of other debris items (e.g. sand and wood) and correlated to the ingestion of fish eggs, earthworms, and mollusks, suggesting that sunfish incidentally ingest microplastics during their normal feeding methods. The high frequency of microplastic ingestion suggest that further research is needed to determine the residence time of microplastics within the stomach and gut, potential for food web transfer, and adverse effects on wildlife and ecosystemic health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",26807984,

The ability of these silicone gel sheets to inhibit hypertrophic scar in a rabbit ear wound model was examined. METHODS: Ten New Zealand White rabbits with a total of 80 wounds in both ears were used in this study. The rabbits were divided into five groups (control; silicone gel sheet; and silicone gel sheet plus 0.25, 2.5, and 25 mg of verapamil per gram). Histopathologic findings were quantified. RESULTS: The mean scar elevation index, fibroblast counts, and capillary counts differed significantly among the five groups (p < 0.05). The median scar elevation index was significantly lower in the silicone gel sheet plus 2.5 mg of verapamil per gram group than in the silicone gel sheet group (1.2 versus 2.2). The median number of fibroblasts was significantly lower in the silicone gel sheet plus 0.25 mg of verapamil per gram group than in the silicone gel sheet group (172.5 versus 243). In the median number of capillary lumina, there was no significant difference between the silicone gel sheet group and the silicone gel sheet plus 0.25, 2.5, and 25 mg of verapamil per gram groups (28.5, 18, 20, and 18, respectively).

This study investigated the combined effects of gold nanoparticles (Au-NP), microplastics (MP) and temperature increase on Pomatoschistus microps, an important prey for several higher level predators, including some species edible to humans. Four null hypotheses were tested: H01: P. microps juveniles do not take up Au-NP through the water; H02: Au-NP (ppb range) are not toxic to juveniles; H03: the presence of MP do not influence the effects of Au-NP on juveniles; H04: temperature increase (20-25Â°C) does not change the effects of the tested chemicals on juveniles. Wild juveniles were acclimated to laboratory conditions. Then, they were exposed to Au-NP (â‰ˆ5nm diameter) and MP (polyethylene spheres, 1-5Î¼m diameter), alone and in mixture, at 20Â°C and 25Â°C, in semi-static conditions. After 96h of exposure to Au-NP, fish had gold in their body (0.129-0.546Î¼g/g w.w.) leading to H01 refusal. Exposure to Au-NP alone caused a predatory performance decrease (â‰ˆ-39%, p<0.05) leading to H02 refusal. MP did not change the Au-NP toxicity leading to H03 acceptance. Temperature rise significantly increased the concentration of gold in fish exposed to Au-NP (â‰ˆ2.3 fold), and interacted with chemical effects (e.g. glutathione S-transferases activity) leading to H04 refusal. Thus, the results of this study highlight the importance of further investigating the effects of multi-stressors on marine fish, particularly the effects of temperature on the uptake, biotransformation, elimination and effects of nanoparticles and microplastics, either alone or in mixture. This knowledge is most important to improve the basis for environmental and human risk assessments of these environmental contaminants of high concern.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Fulltext",26642093,

Particle size showed no significant effect on overall delivery potential but did improve percent release of encapsulated protein over the micro-scale particle size range studied. Protein size was shown to have a significant impact on the delivery capability of the P(IA-co-NVP) hydrogel. We show that when using P(IA-co-NVP) hydrogel microparticles with 3 mol% tetra(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate crosslinker, a small polypeptide (salmon calcitonin) loads and releases up to 45 Î¼g/mg hydrogel while the mid-sized protein urokinase and large monoclonal antibody rituximab load and release only 19 and 24 Î¼g/mg hydrogel, respectively. We further demonstrate that crosslinking density offers a simple method for tuning hydrogel properties to variously sized proteins. Using 5 mol% TEGDMA crosslinker offers optimal performance for the small peptide, salmon calcitonin, whereas lower crosslinking density of 1 mol% offers optimal performance for the much larger protein rituximab. Finally, an enzymatically-degradable hydrogels of P(MAA-co-NVP) crosslinked with the peptide sequence MMRRRKK were synthesized and tested in simulated gastric and intestinal conditions. These hydrogels offer ideal loading and release behavior, showing no degradative release of encapsulated salmon calcitonin in gastric conditions while yielding rapid and complete release of encapsulated protein within 1h in intestinal conditions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",26616761,PMC4734382

Here we report that CARP-1 functional mimetic (CFMs) compounds 4 and 5, and 4.6, a structurally related analog of CFM-4, are potent inhibitors of TNBC and NSCLC cells in vitro. Cell growth suppression by CFM-4 and -4.6 involved interaction and elevated expression of CARP-1/CCAR1 and Death Effector Domain (DED) containing DNA binding (DEDD)2 proteins. Apoptosis by these compounds also involved activation of pro-apoptotic stress-activated kinases p38 and JNK1/2, cleavage of PARP and loss of mitotic cyclin B1. Both the CFMs inhibited abilities of NSCLC and TNBC cells to migrate, invade, and form colonies in suspension, while disrupting tubule formation by the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Nano-lipid formulation of CFM-4 (CFM-4 NLF) enhanced its serum bioavailability when compared with the free CFM-4. Oral administration of CFM-4 NLF reduced weights and volume of the xenografted tumors derived from A549 NSCLC and MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. Although no gross tissue or histological toxicities were noticed, the immuno-histochemical analysis revealed increased CARP-1 and DNA fragmentation in tumors of the CFM-4 NLF-treated animals. In conclusion, while stimulation of pro-apoptotic CARP-1 and DEDD2 expression and their binding underscore a novel mechanism of apoptosis transduction by CFM compounds, our proof-of-concept xenograft studies demonstrate therapeutic potential of CFM-4 for TNBC and NSCLC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",26485930,PMC5090172

The serum levels of total protein was decreased significantly (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) by increasing nanosilver concentration but ALP, LDH, AST and ALT increased significantly (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). It is concluded that nanosilver induces gill and kidney damages and changes the biochemical parameters of O. mykiss juveniles in different concentrations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Retracted,MEC: Fulltext,QUE: Fulltext,MEC: Retracted | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study | USER-NOTES: {""elisa.calcagnotto""=>[""Retracted""]}",26322234,PMC4552984

This community was sampled in August 2011, November 2011, and March 2012 at two different sites in the Calvi Bay (Corsica). Ingested artificial fibers (AFs) of various sizes and colors were found in 27.6% of the digestive tracts of the nine dominant species regardless of their trophic level or taxon. No seasonal, spatial, size, or species-specific significant differences were revealed; suggesting that invertebrates ingest AFs at constant rates. Results showed that, in the gut contents of invertebrates, varying by trophic level, and across trophic levels, the overall ingestion of AFs was low (approximately 1 fiber per organism). Raman spectroscopy revealed that the ingested AFs were composed of viscose, an artificial, cellulose-based polymer. Most of these AFs also appeared to have been colored by industrial dyes. Two dyes were identified: Direct Blue 22 and Direct Red 28. The latter is known for being carcinogenic for vertebrates, potentially causing environmental problems for the P. oceanica litter community.

However, a clear evidence of tissue accumulation and transfer of such microparticles in wild organisms is still lacking, partially hampered by technical difficulties in isolation and characterization protocols from biological samples. In this work, we compared the efficacy of some existing approaches and we optimized a new protocol allowing an extraction yield of microplastics from fish tissues ranging between 78% and 98%, depending on the polymer size. FT-IR analyses confirmed that the extraction procedure did not affect the particles characteristics. The method was further validated on the fish mullet, Mugil cephalus, exposed under laboratory conditions to polystyrene and polyethylene; the particles were isolated and quantified in stomach and liver, and their presence in the hepatic tissue was confirmed also by histological analyses. A preliminary characterization revealed the presence and distribution of microplastics in various fish species collected along the Adriatic Sea. FT-IR analyses indicated polyethylene as the predominant polymer (65%) in the stomach of fish.

Here, the potential influence of MP in the short-term toxicity of chromium to early juveniles of Pomatoschistus microps was investigated. Three null hypotheses were tested: (1) exposure to Cr(VI) concentrations in the low ppm range does not induce toxic effects on juveniles; (2) the presence of microplastics in the water does not influence the acute toxicity of Cr(VI) to juveniles; (3) the environmental conditions of the natural habitat where fish developed do not influence their sensitivity to Cr(VI)-induced acute stress. Fish were collected in the estuaries of Minho (M-est) and Lima (L-est) Rivers (NW Iberian Peninsula) that have several abiotic differences, including in the water and sediment concentrations of various environmental contaminants. After acclimatization to laboratory conditions, two 96h acute bioassays were carried out with juveniles from both estuaries to: (i) investigate the effects of Cr(VI) alone; (ii) investigate the effects of Cr(VI) in the presence of MP (polyethylene spheres 1-5Î¼m âˆ…). Cr(VI) alone induced mortality (96h-LC50s: 14.4-30.5mg/l) and significantly decreased fish predatory performance (â‰¤74%). Thus, in the range of concentrations tested (5.6-28.4mg/l) Cr(VI) was found to be toxic to P. microps early juveniles, therefore, we rejected hypothesis 1. Under simultaneous exposure to Cr(VI) and MP, a significant decrease of the predatory performance (â‰¤67%) and a significant inhibition of AChE activity (â‰¤31%) were found. AChE inhibition was not observed in the test with Cr(VI) alone and MP alone caused an AChE inhibition â‰¤21%. Mixture treatments containing Cr(VI) concentration â‰¥3.9mg/l significantly increased LPO levels in L-est fish, an effect that was not observed under Cr(VI) or MP single exposures. Thus, toxicological interactions between Cr(VI) and MP occurred, therefore, we rejected hypothesis 2. In the presence of MP, the negative effect caused by high concentrations of Cr(VI) on the predatory performance was significantly reduced in L-est fish but not in M-est fish, and Cr(VI) concentrations higher than 3.9mg/l caused oxidative damage in L-est fish but not in M-est fish. The acclimatization and test conditions were similar for fish from the two estuaries and these ecosystems have environmental differences. Thus, long-term exposure to distinct environmental conditions in the natural habitat during previous developmental phases influenced the sensitivity and responses of juveniles to Cr(VI), therefore, we rejected hypothesis 3. Overall, the results of this study indicate toxicological interactions between MP and Cr(VI) highlighting the importance of further investigating the combined effects of MP and other common contaminants.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Included"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Fulltext",26004740,

It is among the first sites of xenobiotic exposure, and gill histopathological alterations may be detected soon after toxicant exposure. Silver (Ag) is one of the most toxic metals to aquatic organisms mainly due to its ability to disrupt ionic regulation. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of ionic and nanoscale Ag on fathead minnow gills by examining gill histology and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase immunoreactivity. Fathead minnows were exposed to two measured concentrations of silver nitrate (AgNO3: 1.3 or 3.7 Î¼g/L as Ag(+)), citrate silver nanoparticles (citrate-AgNP: 15 or 39 Î¼g/L), and polyvinylpyrrolidone-AgNP (PVP-AgNP) (AgNP: 11 or 50 Î¼g/L). Circulatory disturbances were the most prevalent gill alterations detected and were significantly increased in all Ag treatment groups compared to control. AgNO3 (1.3 Î¼g/L) was the only treatment that significantly elevated the number of total mucous goblet cells present. In all other Ag treatments, the percent of degenerated goblet cells was significantly increased compared to control. When the sum of all histopathological abnormalities (weighted index) was calculated, all Ag groups displayed a significantly higher index, with citrate-AgNP having the highest toxicity (index of 10 Â± 0.32 versus 2.4 Â± 0.6 in controls). Gill Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase immunoreactivity was decreased by Ag. These results indicated that both AgNO3 and AgNP created similar disruptions in gill structure and ionic regulation, possibly due to the ionic Ag portion of each treatment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",25734626,

The extraction efficiency and the purity of the recovered DNA are at least comparable to those achieved by using the reported sorbent materials or commercial kits.

The pepsin NPs coated on the solid surfaces have been characterized by HRSEM, TEM, FTIR, XPS and DLS. The amount of enzyme introduced on the substrates, the leaching properties, and the catalytic activity of the immobilized enzyme on the three surfaces are compared. Catalytic activities of pepsin deposited onto the three solid surfaces as well as free pepsin, without sonication, and free pepsin NPs were compared at various pH levels and temperatures using a hemoglobin assay. Compared to native pepsin, pepsin coated onto PE showed the best catalytic activity in all the examined parameters. Pepsin immobilized on glass exhibited better activity than the native enzyme, especially at high temperatures. Enzyme activity of pepsin immobilized on PC was no better than native enzyme activity at all temperatures at pH 2, and only over a narrow pH range at 37Â°C was the activity improved over the native enzyme. A remarkable observation is that immobilized pepsin on all the surfaces was still active to some extent even at pH 7, while free pepsin was completely inactive. The kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax were also calculated and compared for all the samples. Relative to the free enzyme, pepsin coated PE showed the greatest improvement in kinetic parameters (Km=15g/L, Vmax=719U/mg versus Km=12.6g/L and Vmax=787U/mg, respectively), whereas pepsin coated on PC exhibited the most unfavorable kinetic parameters (Km=18g/L, Vmax=685U/mg).

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to gain knowledge about how plastic nanoparticles enter and affect living organisms. Here we have administered 24 and 27 nm polystyrene nanoparticles to fish through an aquatic food chain, from algae through Daphnia, and studied the effects on behavior and metabolism.

In this study, the acute toxicity and chronic toxicity to zebrafish (Danio rerio) induced by PFOS in the presence of ZnO-NPs were investigated, including developmental toxicity and DNA damage. The embryos were exposed to PFOS (only) (0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 mg/L) and PFOS plus ZnO-NPs (0.4â€‰+â€‰50, 0.8â€‰+â€‰50, and 1.6â€‰+â€‰50 mg/L) solutions to evaluate mortality (96 h), body length (96 h), hatch rate (72 h), heart rate (48 h),and malformation rate (96 h). The results revealed that the co-treatment could cause more severe developmental toxicity compared with the control and single-treatments, and the toxic effects generally increased in a dose-response manner. In addition, adult zebrafish were exposed to single and mixed solutions of PFOS and ZnO-NPs (at the concentrations mentioned above) for 30 days. DNA damage to zebrafish was evaluated by the comet assay and micronucleus test. We found that the PFOS single-treatment at all doses (0.4, 0.8, and 1.6 mg/L) could strongly induce DNA damage to peripheral blood cells and that ZnO-NPs could aggravate the formation of DNA damage in co-treatments. Histological examination of liver, testicle, and ovary showed that the presence of ZnO-NPs (50 mg/L) could also cause more serious histological damage to adult zebrafish than PFOS alone. As a result, the synergistic effects played an important role during joint exposure. Our observations provide a basic understanding of the joint toxicity of PFOS and ZnO-NPs to aquatic organisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",25258305,

The ecological impacts and fate of microplastic debris are only beginning to be revealed, with previous research into these topics having primarily focused on higher organisms and/or pelagic environments. Despite recent research into plastic-associated microorganisms in seawater, the microbial colonization of microplastics in benthic habitats has not been studied. Therefore, we employed a 14-day microcosm experiment to investigate bacterial colonization of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) microplastics within three types of coastal marine sediment from Spurn Point, Humber Estuary, U.K. RESULTS: Bacterial attachment onto LDPE within sediments was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridisation (CARD-FISH). Log-fold increases in the abundance of 16S rRNA genes from LDPE-associated bacteria occurred within 7 days with 16S rRNA gene numbers on LDPE surfaces differing significantly across sediment types, as shown by quantitative PCR. Terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis demonstrated rapid selection of LDPE-associated bacterial assemblages whose structure and composition differed significantly from those in surrounding sediments. Additionally, T-RFLP analysis revealed successional convergence of the LDPE-associated communities from the different sediments over the 14-day experiment. Sequencing of cloned 16S rRNA genes demonstrated that these communities were dominated after 14 days by the genera Arcobacter and Colwellia (totalling 84-93% of sequences). Attachment by Colwellia spp. onto LDPE within sediments was confirmed by CARD-FISH. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that bacteria within coastal marine sediments can rapidly colonize LDPE microplastics, with evidence for the successional formation of plastisphere-specific bacterial assemblages. Although the taxonomic compositions of these assemblages are likely to differ between marine sediments and the water column, both Arcobacter and Colwellia spp. have previously been affiliated with the degradation of hydrocarbon contaminants within low-temperature marine environments. Since hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria have also been discovered on plastic fragments in seawater, our data suggest that recruitment of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria on microplastics is likely to represent a shared feature between both benthic and pelagic marine habitats.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",25245856,PMC4177575

Therefore, we evaluated the biological interactions of single-wall carbon nanotubes functionalized with polyethylene glycol (SWNT-PEG). For this purpose, we analyzed biochemical, histological, behavioral and biodistribution parameters to understand how this material behaves in vitro and in vivo using the fish Danio rerio (zebrafish) as a biological model. The in vitro results for fish brain homogenates indicated that SWNT-PEG had an effect on lipid peroxidation and GSH (reduced glutathione) content. However, after intraperitoneal exposure, SWNT-PEG proved to be less biocompatible and formed aggregates, suggesting that the PEG used for the nanoparticle functionalization was of an inappropriate size for maintaining product stability in a biological environment. This problem with functionalization may have contributed to the low or practically absent biodistribution of SWNT-PEG in zebrafish tissues, as verified by Raman spectroscopy. There was an accumulation of material in the abdominal cavity that led to inflammation and behavioral disturbances, as evaluated by a histological analysis and an open field test, respectively. These results provide evidence of a lack of biocompatibility of SWNTs modified with short chain PEGs, which leads to the accumulation of the material, tissue damage and behavioral alterations in the tested subjects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",25168427,

This study is the first to evaluate the abundance, distribution, and composition of pelagic microplastic pollution in a large, remote, mountain lake. We quantified pelagic microplastics and shoreline anthropogenic debris in Lake Hovsgol, Mongolia. With an average microplastic density of 20,264 particles km(-2), Lake Hovsgol is more heavily polluted with microplastics than the more developed Lakes Huron and Superior in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Fragments and films were the most abundant microplastic types; no plastic microbeads and few pellets were observed. Household plastics dominated the shoreline debris and were comprised largely of plastic bottles, fishing gear, and bags. Microplastic density decreased with distance from the southwestern shore, the most populated and accessible section of the park, and was distributed by the prevailing winds. These results demonstrate that without proper waste management, low-density populations can heavily pollute freshwater systems with consumer plastics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",24973278,

CeO2 nanorods with AR â‰¥ 22 induced lysosomal damage and progressive effects on IL-1Î² production and cytotoxicity in the human myeloid cell line, THP-1. In order to determine whether this toxicological paradigm for long aspect ratio (LAR) CeO2 is also relevant in vivo, we performed comparative studies in the mouse lung and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of zebrafish larvae. Although oropharyngeal aspiration could induce acute lung inflammation for CeO2 nanospheres and nanorods, only the nanorods with the highest AR (C5) induced significant IL-1Î² and TGF-Î²1 production in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at 21 days but did not induce pulmonary fibrosis. However, after a longer duration (44 days) exposure to 4 mg/kg of the C5 nanorods, more collagen production was seen with CeO2 nanorods vs nanospheres after correcting for Ce lung burden. Using an oral-exposure model in zebrafish larvae, we demonstrated that C5 nanorods also induced significant growth inhibition, a decrease in body weight, and delayed vertebral calcification. In contrast, CeO2 nanospheres and shorter nanorods had no effect. Histological and transmission electron microscopy analyses showed that the key injury mechanism of C5 was in the epithelial lining of the GIT, which demonstrated blunted microvilli and compromised digestive function. All considered, these data demonstrate that, similar to cellular studies, LAR CeO2 nanorods exhibit more toxicity in the lung and GIT, which could be relevant to inhalation and environmental hazard potential.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",24720650,PMC4059546

Exposure to nZnO caused several changes in levels of liver enzyme activity, antioxidants, and lipid peroxidation end products consistent with an oxidative stress response. Aconitase activity decreased by ~65% but tended to be restored to original levels upon supplementation with Fe(2+), indicating oxidative inactivation of the 4Fe-4S cluster. Furthermore, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity decreased by ~29%, and glutathione levels increased by ~56%. Taken together, these suggest that nZnO induces hepatic physiological stress. Each assay was then validated by using a single liver homogenate or plasma sample that was partitioned and treated with nZnO or Zn(2+), the breakdown product of nZnO. It was found that Zn(2+), but not nZnO, increased detected glutathione reductase activity by ~14% and decreased detected malondialdehyde by ~39%. This indicates that if appreciable nZnO dissolution occurs in liver samples during processing and assay, it may skew results, with implications not only for this study, but also for a wide range of nanotoxicology studies focusing on nZnO. Finally, in vitro incubations of cell-free rat blood plasma with nZnO failed to generate any significant increase in malondialdehyde or protein carbonyl levels, or any significant decrease in ferric reducing ability of plasma. This suggests that at the level tested, any oxidative stress caused by nZnO is the result of a coordinated physiological response by the liver.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",24704545,

Uncertainty in the most crucial parameters is accounted for by probabilistic modeling. Our conservative analysis shows that plastic ingestion by the lugworm yields NP and BPA concentrations that stay below the lower ends of global NP and BPA concentration ranges, and therefore are not likely to constitute a relevant exposure pathway.

The 839 marine plastics recorded were predominantly small fragments (""microplastics"", median lengthâ€Š=â€Š2.8 mm, mean lengthâ€Š=â€Š4.9 mm) resulting from the breakdown of larger objects made of polyethylene and polypropylene (e.g. packaging and fishing items). Mean sea surface plastic concentration was 4256.4 pieces km(-2), and after incorporating the effect of vertical wind mixing, this value increased to 8966.3 pieces km(-2). These plastics appear to be associated with a wide range of ocean currents that connect the sampled sites to their international and domestic sources, including populated areas of Australia's east coast. This study shows that plastic contamination levels in surface waters of Australia are similar to those in the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Maine, but considerably lower than those found in the subtropical gyres and Mediterranean Sea.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six New Zealand White rabbits were inoculated with either complete Freund's adjuvant cell suspension (n = 3) to induce reactively enlarged lymph nodes or with VX2 tumor cells to produce metastatic lymph nodes (n = 3). Image acquisition was performed before and 24 hours after bolus injection of an USPIO contrast agent at 1.5T and afterward at 7T using T1-weighted and T2*-weighted sequences. Sensitivities, specificities, and negative and positive predictive values for the detection of lymph node metastases were calculated for both field strengths with histopathology serving as reference standard. Sizes of lymph nodes with no, inflammatory, and malignant changes were compared using a Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: All 24 lymph nodes were detected at 1.5T as well as at 7T. At 1.5T, sensitivity amounted to 0.67, while specificity reached a value of 1. At the higher field strength (7T), imaging was able to reach sensitivity and specificity values of 1. No statistical differences were detected concerning lymph node sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance lymphography with USPIO contrast agents allows for differentiation of normal and reactively enlarged lymph nodes compared to metastatic nodes. First experiments at 7T show promising results compared to 1.5T, which have to be evaluated in further trials.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",24200489,

However, potential toxicological implications are not sufficiently known. Here we investigate effects of AgNPs (average size 120 nm) on zebrafish in vitro and in vivo, and compare them to human hepatoma cells (Huh7). AgNPs are incorporated in zebrafish liver cells (ZFL) and Huh7, and in zebrafish embryos. In ZFL cells AgNPs lead to induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress response, and TNF-Î±. Transcriptional alterations also occur in pro-apoptotic genes p53 and Bax. The transcriptional profile differed in ZFL and Huh7 cells. In ZFL cells, the ER stress marker BiP is induced, concomitant with the ER stress marker ATF-6 and spliced XBP-1 after 6h and 24h exposure to 0.5 g/L and 0.05 g/L AgNPs, respectively. This indicates the induction of different pathways of the ER stress response. Moreover, AgNPs induce TNF-Î±. In zebrafish embryos exposed to 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 5mg/L AgNPs hatching was affected and morphological defects occurred at high concentrations. ER stress related gene transcripts BiP and Synv are significantly up-regulated after 24h at 0.1 and 5mg/L AgNPs. Furthermore, transcriptional alterations occurred in the pro-apoptotic genes Noxa and p21. The ER stress response was strong in ZFL cells and occurred in zebrafish embryos as well.

The optimized parameters for MSPE with OA-MNBs of LMG from fish muscle involved a combination of pH 10.0 in 10% acetonitrile, 1.5 M sodium chloride as an adsorption solution, and an extraction procedure involving 6 mg OA-MNBs in 18 mL LMG adsorption solution. This was optimized for 0.5 g fish muscles with an incubation period of 10 min using 200 Î¼L acetonitrile for elution. Using the optimized parameters, the performance of MSPE with OA-MNBs was evaluated by analyzing LMG-spiked fish extracts with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. The results indicated that recoveries of LMG (from 0.1 to 2 ng/g) ranged from 71.2%-112.6% with relative standard deviations as low as 0.6%. Out of 57 field fish samples, eight LMG positive samples were confirmed using MSPE with OA-MNBs. Compared with traditional liquid-liquid extraction methods, the results showed that MSPE with OA-MNBs had a higher sensitivity for samples with low LMG concentration. Furthermore, the MSPE with OA-MNB took only 40 min to perform without the need for time consuming sample-pretreatment process. Therefore, MSPE with OA-MNBs holds promise for rapid, sensitive, and cost effective screening for LMG in fish samples.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention,1 - Type of study",22841089,

This paper describes the impacts of boring isopods in aquaculture facilities and docks, quantifies and discusses the implications of these microplastics, and tests if an alternate foam type prevents boring. Floats from aquaculture facilities and docks were heavily damaged by thousands of isopods and their burrows. Multiple sites in Asia, Australia, Panama, and the USA exhibited evidence of isopod damage. One isopod creates thousands of microplastic particles when excavating a burrow; colonies can expel millions of particles. Microplastics similar in size to these particles may facilitate the spread of non-native species or be ingested by organisms causing physical or toxicological harm. Extruded polystyrene inhibited boring, suggesting this foam may prevent damage in the field. These results reveal boring isopods cause widespread damage to docks and are a novel source of microplastic pollution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",22763283,

The present study was designed to test whether combined gene therapy with IP-10, a potent antitumor chemokine, and Caspy2 would improve therapy efficacy. Recombinant plasmid expressing both Caspy2 and IP-10 genes was mixed with DOTAP-cholesterol nanoparticles. Immunocompetent mice bearing CT26 colon carcinoma, B16-F10 melanoma, and 4T1 breast carcinoma were treated with the complex. We found that the combined gene therapy more efficiently inhibited tumor growth, while efficiently prolonging the survival of tumor-bearing animals, compared with monotherapy. Moreover, a significant reduction in spontaneous lung metastasis could be observed in the 4T1 breast carcinoma model. Infiltration of CD8(+) T lymphocytes was also observed. In addition, apoptotic cells were widely detected by TUNEL assay and caspase-3 immunostaining in coadministered tumor tissues. The combination treatment also successfully inhibited angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation as assessed by CD31 and Ki-67 immunostaining, respectively. Furthermore, depletion of CD8(+) T lymphocytes could significantly abrogate the antitumor activity, whereas the depletion of CD4(+) cells or natural killer cells showed partial abrogation. Rechallenged CT26 tumors were rejected in all of the surviving mice treated by combination therapy. Our results suggest that combined therapy with Caspy2 and IP-10 can significantly enhance antitumor activity by acting as an immune response initiator, apoptosis inducer, and angiogenesis inhibitor, which may be important for further applications in clinical cancer therapy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,3 - Intervention",22548488,

Metal-containing engineered nanoparticles (NPs) are an important group of these new materials, and are often made of one metal (e.g., Cu-NPs and Ag-NPs), metal oxides (e.g., ZnO and TiO(2) NPs), or composite of several metals. The physiological effects and toxicity of trace metals in the traditional dissolved form are relatively well known and the overall aim of this review was to use our existing conceptual framework of metal toxicity in fish to compare and contrast the effects of nanometals. Conceptually, there are some fundamental differences that relate to bioavailability and uptake. The chemistry and behaviour of nanometals involves dynamic aspects of aggregation theory, rather than the equilibrium models traditionally used for free metal ions. Some NPs, such as Cu-NPs, may also release free metal ions from the surface of the particle. Biological uptake of NPs is not likely via ion transporters, but endocytosis is a possible uptake mechanism. The body distribution, metabolism, and excretion of nanometals is poorly understood and hampered by a lack of methods for measuring NPs in tissues. Although data sets are still limited, emerging studies on the acute toxicity of nanometals have so far shown that these materials can be lethal to fish in the mg-Î¼gl(-1) range, depending on the type of material. Evidence suggests that some nanometals can be more acutely toxic to some fish than dissolved forms. For example, juvenile zebrafish have a 48-h LC(50) of about 0.71 and 1.78mgl(-1) for nano- and dissolved forms of Cu respectively. The acute toxicity of metal NPs is not always explained, or only partly explained, by the presence of free metal ions; suggesting that other novel mechanisms may be involved in bioavailability. Evidence suggests that nanometals can cause a range of sublethal effects in fish including respiratory toxicity, disturbances to trace elements in tissues, inhibition of Na(+)K(+)-ATPase, and oxidative stress. Organ pathologies from nanometals can be found in a range of organs including the gill, liver, intestine, and brain. These sublethal effects suggest some common features in the sublethal responses to nanometals compared to metal salts. Effects on early life stages of fish are also emerging, with reports of nanometals crossing the chorion (e.g., Ag-NPs), and suggestions that the nano-forms of some metals (Cu-NPs and ZnO NPs) may be more toxic to embryos or juveniles, than the equivalent metal salt. It remains possible that nanometals could interfere with, and/or stimulate stress responses in fish; but data has yet to be collected on this aspect. We conclude that nanometals do have adverse physiological effects on fish, and the hazard for some metal NPs will be different to the traditional dissolved forms of metals.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",21474182,

Detection of viral RNA in both tests is based on nucleic acid amplification followed by hybridization to capture probes immobilized on a glass slide. A novel technology utilizing gold nanoparticle-conjugated probes is utilized to detect the presence of captured target DNA. This microarray-based approach to detection has proven to be more sensitive than the traditional culture/direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) method for detecting RSV and influenza viruses in clinical specimens, including the novel 2009 H1N1 strain. Specifically, we report 98.0% sensitivity and 96.5% specificity for the VRNAT compared to culture/DFA. Further, the VRNAT detected virus in an additional 58% of specimens that were culture negative. These data were confirmed using bidirectional sequencing. Evaluation of the fully automated RVNAT(SP), which is built on the same detection technology as the VRNAT but contains an updated processor enabling complete automation, revealed the two tests to be functionally equivalent.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study protocol was approved by the animal experimentation ethics committee. A recently introduced USPIO, P904, and a reference-standard USPIO, ferumoxtran-10, were tested in a rabbit model of induced aortic atherosclerosis. In vivo magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and T2*-weighted plaque MR imaging were performed at baseline and after administration of P904 and ferumoxtran-10 (administered dose for both, 1000 micromol of iron per kilogram of body weight) in 26 hyperlipidemic New Zealand white rabbits. The variation in vessel wall area over time was evaluated with nonparametric testing. Ex vivo MR imaging findings were compared with iron content at linear regression analysis. RESULTS: With in vivo MR imaging, plaque analysis was possible as early as 24 hours after P904 injection. The authors observed a 27.75% increase in vessel wall area due to susceptibility artifacts on day 2 (P = .04) and a 38.81% increase on day 3 (P = .04) after P904 administration compared with a 44.5% increase in vessel wall area on day 7 (P = .04) and a 34.8% increase on day 10 (P = .22) after ferumoxtran-10 administration. These susceptibility artifacts were correlated with intraplaque iron uptake in the corresponding histologic slices. The number of pixels with signal loss on the ex vivo MR images was linearly correlated with the logarithm of the iron concentration (P = .0001; R(2) = 0.93). CONCLUSION: Plaque inflammation in rabbits can be detected earlier with P904 than with ferumoxtran-10 owing to the faster blood pharmacokinetics and the early uptake of P904 in the reticuloendothelial system.

The purpose of the present study was to use the nanosuspension method to prepare C. chinensis nanoparticles (CN), and to compare the hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects of C. chinensis ethanolic extract (CE) and CN on acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. An oral dose of CE at 125 and 250 mg/kg and CN at 25 and 50mg/kg showed a significant hepatoprotective effect relatively to the same extent (P<0.05) by reducing levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. These biochemical assessments were supported by rat hepatic biopsy examinations. In addition, the antioxidant activities of CE and CN both significantly increased superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and reduced malondialdehyde (P<0.05). Moreover, the results also indicated that the hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects of 50 mg/kg CN was effectively better than 125 mg/kg CE (P<0.05), and an oral dose of CN that is five times as less as CE could exhibit similar levels of outcomes. In conclusion, we suggest that the nanoparticles system can be applied to overcome other water poorly soluble herbal medicines and furthermore to decrease the treatment dosage.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",18308443,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Experiments were conducted on 6 heritable hyperlipidemic and 3 New Zealand White rabbits. 3D MR angiography (MRA) of the thoracic aorta was performed on all rabbits by use of a conventional paramagnetic contrast agent that failed to reveal any abnormalities. One week later, all rabbits except 1 of the hyperlipidemic animals were injected with a USPIO contrast agent (Sinerem, Guerbet) at a dose of 1 mmol Fe/kg. 3D MRA data sets collected over the subsequent 5 days showed increasing signal in the aortic lumen. Whereas the aortic wall of the control rabbits remained smooth and bright, marked susceptibility effects became evident on day 4 within the aortic walls of hyperlipidemic rabbits. Ex vivo imaging of aortic specimens confirmed the in vivo results. Histopathology documented marked Fe uptake in macrophages embedded in atherosclerotic plaque of the hyperlipidemic rabbits. Electron microscopy showed multiple cytoplasmic Fe particles in macrophages. No such changes were seen in control rabbits or in the hyperlipidemic rabbit that had not received Sinerem. CONCLUSIONS: USPIOs are phagocytosed by macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques of the aortic wall of hyperlipidemic rabbits in a quantity sufficient to cause susceptibility effects detectable by MRI.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",11157694,

Twenty New Zealand white rabbits (n = 10 following total body irradiation and n = 10 controls) underwent AMI-227-enhanced MRI. Pulse sequences included dynamic fast low-angle shot (FLASH; TR/TE 50/4 msec, flip angle 60 degrees) MRI and static T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) and turbo-SE sequences of the lumbar spine and sacrum. Bone marrow enhancement was quantified as delta signal intensity (SI) (%) =|[(SIpost - SIpre)/SIpre] x 100%| and compared with histopathology, including iron stains and electron microscopy. Dynamic bone marrow deltaSI (%) data steadily increased up to 10-15 minutes after AMI-227 administration, while blood deltaSI (%) data stayed nearly constant, histologically corresponding to iron oxide leakage into the bone marrow interstitium. This bone marrow contrast enhancement increased significantly following irradiation, corresponding to alterations of the endothelial lining of the bone marrow sinusoids. Late postcontrast images exhibited a significant positive T1 enhancement and negative T2 enhancement of the normal bone marrow, which further increased with irradiation due to increased RES activity. Irradiation-induced changes in bone marrow physiology could be reliably assessed with AMI-227-enhanced MRI.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",10331759,

Likewise, 21 different samples of commercial table salt from Spain have been analyzed for MPs content and nature. The samples comprise sea salts and well salts, before and after packing. The microplastic content found was of 50-280 MPs/kg salt, being polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) the most frequently found polymer, followed by polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE), with no significant differences among all the samples.

As an example transmission, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging can be used to analyze samples directly on filters without any visual presorting, when the environmental sample was afore extracted, purified, and filtered. However, this analytical approach is strongly restricted by the limited IR transparency of conventional filter materials. Within this study, we describe a novel silicon (Si) filter substrate produced by photolithographic microstructuring, which guarantees sufficient transparency for the broad mid-infrared region of 4000-600 cm(-1). This filter type features holes with a diameter of 10 mu m and exhibits adequate mechanical stability. Furthermore, it will be shown that our Si filter substrate allows a distinct identification of the most common microplastics, polyethylene (PE), and polypropylene (PP), in the characteristic fingerprint region (1400-600 cm(-1)). Moreover, using the Si filter substrate, a differentiation of microparticles of polyesters having quite similar chemical structure, like polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), is now possible, which facilitates a visualization of their distribution within a microplastic sample by FTIR imaging. Finally, this Si filter can also be used as substrate for Raman microscopy-a second complementary spectroscopic technique-to identify microplastic samples.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

In the present study, effluents from the largest water reclamation plant in China were sampled throughout the treatment process and microplastics were extracted and identified to evaluate their removal. As expected, microplastics were detected in the influent (12.03 +/- 1.29 items/L). Following treatment, concentrations of microplastics were reduced by greater than 95% and 0.59 +/- 0.22 items/L of microplastics were detected in reclaimed waters. Among detected microplastics, 18 types of polymers of ten colors were identified. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP) accounted for greater than 70% of detected microplastics. Furthermore, microfibers were the dominant shape detected with an average size of 1110.72 +/- 862.95 mu m. However, microparticles accounted for only 14.08% of total microplastics with an average size of 681.46 +/- 528.73 mu m. Results of the present study suggest that current treatment technologies employed at the chosen STP are efficient to remove the majority of microplastics, however consideration of STPs as a point source of microplastics is important due to the large volumes of effluents being released into the aquatic environment on a consistent basis.

The present work aimed to investigate the acute toxicity of amino-functionalized polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NH2; 50 nm) as proxy for nanoplastics on brine shrimp Artemia franciscana larvae under different culture conditions and at different stages of development, as well as the combined effect with two reference toxicants - potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) and copper sulfate (CuSO4). Nauplii (instar II or III larval stages) were exposed to different concentrations of PS-NH2 (0.005 to 5 mu g mL(-1)) for up to 48 h, with or without agitation in order to mimic a more realistic environmental scenario. Larval mobility and PS-NH2 accumulation were monitored under microscopy. PS-NH2 alone showed toxicity only at the highest concentration tested (5 mu g mL(-1)) regardless the incubation method used (61.2 + 3.1% and 65.0 + 4.5% with and without agitation, respectively). Moreover, instar III stage was the most sensitive to PS-NH2 exposure (38.2% immobility in 24 h of exposure; 5 mu g mL(-1)). Evidence of PS-NH2 retention in the gastrointestinal tract in a concentration- and time-dependent manner was also obtained. Mixtures of PS-NH2 (0.005 and 5 mu g mL(-1)) with different concentrations of K2Cr2O7 increased the immobilization rate of the larvae after 48 h of exposure, when compared to the K2Cr2O7 alone. Similar results were observed for CuSO4 in the co-exposure conditions at different concentrations. However, exposing nauplii to a mixture of PS-NH2 (0.005 mu g mL(-1)) and CuSO4 decreased immobilization rate, in comparison to the group exposed to CuSO4 alone.

Weathering degradation of plastics on the beaches results in their surface embrittlement and microcracking, yielding microparticles that are carried into water by wind or wave action. Unlike inorganic fines present in sea water, microplastics concentrate persistent organic pollutants (POPs) by partition. The relevant distribution coefficients for common POPs are several orders of magnitude in favour of the plastic medium. Consequently, the microparticles laden with high levels of POPs can be ingested by marine biota. Bioavailability and the efficiency of transfer of the ingested POPs across trophic levels are not known and the potential damage posed by these to the marine ecosystem has yet to be quantified and modelled. Given the increasing levels of plastic pollution of the oceans it is important to better understand the impact of microplastics in the ocean food web. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Knowledge on the potential effects of micrometer scale plastics on marine microalgae remains limited. It remains unknown whether the micrometer scale plastics also affect microalgal growth, lipid accumulation and resistance to organic contaminants? in addition, the role of polymer-size on the potential hazardous effects of MPs on microalgae is unknown. In the present study, cell populations of a marine diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, were treated with micrometer scale polyethylene (PEMP, 150 mu m) and unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVCMP, 250 mu m) powders in the laboratory. Growth was assessed using a hemacytometer and neutral lipid concentrations were evaluated using the Nile Red staining method under short-term (four days) and long-term (nine days) exposure. The effects of combined PEMP and phenanthrene (Phe), and uPVCMP and Phe exposures over four days on growth were investigated. Importance scores and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values were calculated to assess the contributions of seven factors in exposure systems to the hazardous effects of MPs on microalgae using a machine-learning prediction based on 165 data sets. Both MP types did not influence algal growth and lipid accumulation but minimized algal inhibition by the action of Phe at four days. In addition, lipid accumulation was induced at nine days. Both importance scores and SHAP values indicated that MP polymer-size was the key factor influencing MP toxicity in microalgae. In conclusion, MPs had adverse effects only in chronic tests and the potential adsorption of MPs could have led to the lower levels of toxicity in a combined MP-Phe exposure system. Compared to nanoplastics, MPs in the hundred-micrometer range do not significantly affect growth and their adsorption would not be influenced by size. Therefore, MP size is the most critical factor that should be considered in future laboratory tests and eco-toxicological risk assessments for microalgae. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we conduct a systematic review on toxicity of microplastics that focuses on identifying data gaps in the mechanisms of microplastic toxicity. We observe that microplastic toxicology research thus far has focused on ecotoxicity using apical endpoints and only a few studies deal with toxicity mechanisms. Based on this review, we propose putative Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOP5) applicable to microplastic management to understand microplastic toxicity. We matched toxicity mechanisms and apical endpoints to a key event (KE) and adverse outcome (AO) information from the AOP Wiki. Overall, our results suggest that the molecular initiating event (MIE) was reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and the AO was increased mortality, decreased growth and feeding, and reproduction failure. However, there are a limited number of studies on toxicity mechanisms of microplastics and, therefore, evidence concerning the relationship between KEs is not sufficient. Clearly, more studies on toxicity mechanisms are required to fill these gaps in data. This study also suggests that the AOP framework is a suitable tool to integrate existing data from various literature sources and can identify data gaps in microplastic toxicity mechanisms.

A prymnesiophycea, Tisochrysis lutea, a dinoflagellate, Heterocapsa triquetra, and a diatom, Chaetoceros neogracile, were exposed to micro-PS (2 tm diameter; 3.96 mu g L-1) during their growth culture cycles. Micro-PS were quantified using an innovative flow-cytometry approach, which allowed the monitoring of the micro-PS repartition in microalgal cultures and the distinction between free suspended micro-PS and hetero-aggregates of micro-PS and microalgae. Hetero-aggregation was observed for C neogracile during the stationary growth phase. The highest levels of micro-PS were ""lost"" from solution, sticking to flasks, with T. lutea and H. triquetra cultures. This loss of micro-PS sticking to the flask walls increased with the age of the culture for both species. No effects of micro-PS were observed on microalgal physiology in terms of growth and chlorophyll fluorescence.

The results showed that various aquatic organisms in China have been found to consume microplastics. The average number of micro-plastic pieces discovered in biota ranged from 0.07 particles to 164 particles per individual in different organisms. The most frequently observed colors of microplastics detected in biota were blue and transparent, and the detected microplastics mainly consisted of fibers. In addition, the impacts of microplastics on aquatic organisms, including physical impacts, chemical impacts, the trophic transfer of microplastics and the potential risks to humans, were discussed. Finally, knowledge gaps were identified in order to guide future studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we review microplastic contamination in freshwater systems with focus on adsorption of heavy metals. We present microplastic abundance, distribution, impact of microplastic size, affinity for heavy metals and combined toxic effects of the co-occurrence of microplastic and heavy metals. Remarkably, the concentration of metals on polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride was 800 times higher than in the surrounding environment.

To contribute to this challenge, this paper reports results of a microplastic survey from a heavily urbanised catchment, the River Tame and four of its tributaries, which flows through the city of Birmingham, UK. All sediment sampled was found to contain microplastics with an average abundance of 165 particles kg(-1). While urban areas generally have a greater abundance of microplastics as compared with rural, there is no simple relationship between microplastic numbers and population density or proximity to wastewater treatment sites. The greatest change in microplastic abundance was due to the presence of a lake along the course of the River Tame-i.e., flow velocities are reduced on entering the lake, which promotes the deposition of fine sediment and potentially microplastics. This suggests that the greatest concentrations of microplastics will not be found in-channel but rather on the floodplain and other low velocity environments such as meander cutoffs. We also identified a new mechanism of microplastic fixation in freshwater environments through ecological engineers, specifically caddisflies, that incorporated microplastics into their casing. These results highlight the need to explore further hydrodynamic and ecological impacts on microplastics fate and transport in rivers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

In this study, the presence of micro plastics and other anthropogenic debris in seawater and mussels (Mytilus edulis) from coastal waters of the U.K., as well as supermarket sources, was investigated. These were detected in all samples from all sites with spatial differences observed. Seawater samples taken from 6 locations (in triplicates) displayed 3.5 +/- 2.0 debris items/L on average (range: 1.5-6.7 items/L). In wild mussels sampled from 8 locations around the U.K. coastal environment, the number of total debris items varied from 0.7 to 2.9 itemsig of tissue and from 1.1 to 6.4 items/individual. For the supermarket bought mussels, the abundance of microplastics was significantly higher in pre-cooked mussels (1.4 items/g) compared with mussels supplied live (0.9 items/g). Micro-FT-IR spectroscopy was conducted on 136 randomly selected samples, with 94 items characterized. The spectra found that 50% of these debris items characterized were microplastic, with an additional 37% made up of rayon and cotton fibers. The microplastic levels detected in the supermarket bought mussels present a route for human exposure and suggests that their quantification be included as food safety management measures as well as for environmental monitoring health measures.

An additional impact is the ingestion of microplastics by marine species, and thus microplastics enter into the food chain with unpredictable effects on humans. In addition to the exploration of their presence in fishes, researchers are studying the presence of microplastics in coastal areas. The workload is therefore time consuming, due to the need to carry out regular campaigns to quantify their presence in the samples. So, in this work a method for automatic counting and classifying microplastic particles is presented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal to address this challenging problem. The method makes use of Computer Vision techniques for analyzing the acquired images of the samples; and Machine Learning techniques to develop accurate classifiers of the different types of microplastic particles that are considered. The obtained results show that making use of color based and shape based features along with a Random Forest classifier, an accuracy of 96.6% is achieved recognizing four types of particles: pellets, fragments, tar and line.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Whilst there has been increasing field evidence of microplastics accumulation in the guts and tissues of freshwater and marine aquatic species, the uptake mechanisms of microplastics into freshwater food webs, and the physical and geological controls on pathway-specific exposures to microplastics, are not well understood. This knowledge gap is hampering the assessment of exposure risks, and potential ecotoxicological and public health impacts from microplastics.        This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of key research challenges in analysing the environmental fate and transport of microplastics in freshwater ecosystems, including the identification of hydrological, sedimentological and particle property controls on microplastic accumulation in aquatic ecosystems. This mechanistic analysis outlines the dominant pathways for exposure to microplastics in freshwater ecosystems and identifies potentially critical uptake mechanisms and entry pathways for microplastics and associated contaminants into aquatic food webs as well as their risk to accumulate and biomagnify.        We identify seven key research challenges that, if overcome, will permit the advancement beyond current conceptual limitations and provide the mechanistic process understanding required to assess microplastic exposure, uptake, hazard, and overall risk to aquatic systems and humans, and provide key insights into the priority impact pathways in freshwater ecosystems to support environmental management decision making.

The use of plastics in any form releases microplastics to the environment. Existing policy instruments are insufficient to address microplastics pollution and regulatory measures have focussed only on the microbeads and single-use plastics. Fees on the use of plastic products may possibly reduce their usage, but effective management of plastic products at their end-of-life is lacking. Therefore, in this study, the microplastic-failure mode and effect analysis (MP-FMEA) methodology, which is a semi-qualitative approach capable of identifying the causes and proposing solutions for the issue of microplastics pollution, has been proposed. The innovative feature of MP-FMEA is that it has a pre-defined failure mode, that is, the release of microplastics to air, water and soil (depending on the process) or the occurrence of microplastics in the final product. Moreover, a theoretical recycling plant case study was used to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of this method. The results revealed that MP-FMEA is an easy and heuristic technique to understand the failure-effect-causes and solutions for reduction of microplastics and can be applied by researchers working in different domains apart from those relating to microplastics. Future studies can include the evaluation of the use of MP-FMEA methodology along with quantitative methods for effective reduction in the release of microplastics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Due to their small size microplastics have the potential to be ingested by a range of aquatic organisms which mistake them for a food source and can suffer adverse impacts as a result. Development of standardised methods is imperative to provide reliable and meaningful data when analysing microplastic ingestion by marine fauna. A range of proteolytic digestive enzymes ( trypsin, papain and collagenase) were tested to establish optimum digestion efficacy of biological samples and assess the effects of enzymes on microplastics; additionally the applicability of freezing and formaldehyde followed by ethanol as specimen preservation techniques for microplastic research was investigated. Of the enzymes investigated, trypsin yielded the greatest digestive efficacy based on weight reduction ( 88% +/- 2.52 S. D.) at the lowest concentration ( 0.3125%) with no observed impacts on microplastics. Enumeration of microplastics from wild collected Mytilus edulis revealed mean numbers of 1.05 +/- 0.66 S. D. (minimum) to 4.44 +/- 3.03 S. D. (maximum) microplastic particles per g wet weight mussel tissue depending on location. There was no significant difference based on preservation method on the quantification of ingested microplastics and no detrimental impacts were observed on the microplastics directly. Enzymatic digestion using trypsin therefore provides a suitable, time and cost effective method to extract microplastics from M. edulis. Furthermore the preservation methods did not have detrimental effects on microplastics, serving to highlight the suitability of biological samples preserved either way for future inquiries into ingested microplastics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Using several endpoints (lethality, development, reproduction, and/or locomotion behavior), we found that nanopolystyrene could induce more severe toxicity than SiO2-NPs, although nanopolystyrene did not cause the toxicity comparable to that in Al2O3-NPs or TiO2-NPs exposed nematodes. Our data will be useful for understanding the exposure risk of nanopolystyrene on environmental organisms. Moreover, the detected toxicity difference between nanopolystyrene and three metal oxide NPs were associated with the differences in both induction of oxidative stress and activation of mt UPR in exposed nematodes.

Microplastics are an emerging global threat for bivalves and have been commonly detected in commercial edible bivalves, including mussels, oysters and clams. To comprehensively understand impacts of microplastics on bivalves, the potential exposure pathways by which microplastics affect bivalves are reviewed. The existing scientific evidence indicates that microplastics not only directly affect the physiology of bivalves, but also indirectly affect them by changing the structure of their sedimentary habitats, impairing their food resources and delivering persistent organic pollutants. In addition, the consumption of contaminated bivalves is a main pathway of exposure to microplastics by humans, which raises potential human health concerns. An evaluation of the hazards associated with the consumption of bivalves that contain microplastics and associated toxic chemicals is urgently needed. More studies related to the effects of microplastic fibers on bivalves should be conducted, because microplastic fibers comprise the largest proportion of microplastics in the environment and bivalves.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

This study quantified the microplastics in oysters from 17 sites along the coastline of China. Qualitative attributes, such as shape and size, were also determined under a microscope. Additionally, the polymer types were identified using Fourier-Transform Infrared Micro-Spectroscopy (mu-FT-IR). The results showed that the average abundance of microplastics in oyster was 0.62 items/g (wet weight) or 2.93 items/individual. Additionally, 84% of the sampled oysters had inhaled microplastics, indicating the high prevalence of microplastic pollution in different coastal areas of China. Fibers were the most common shape (60.67%), and the most common size was <1500 mu m, accounting for 81.89% of the total microplastics. The mu-FT-IR analysis identified eight different polymers, and the main polymeric types of microplastics were cellophane (CP), polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Our results suggest the widespread prevalence of microplastics in cultured oysters from different coastal areas of China with similar or lower abundances than other countries. In addition, our results exhibited regional characteristics of high microplastics abundance in southern coastal area of China and low microplastics abundance in northern China.

However, further research is required to determine the edible size of microplastics, especially given the ubiquity of microplastics and their adverse effects on the soil environment. Determining the size range of microplastics that can be ingested by soil organisms is crucial for the prediction of the exposure route and toxicity mechanisms of microplastics in soil. Springtails, organisms prevalent in a wide variety of soil ecosystems, can ingest or transport microplastics; however, direct evidence for this has not been reported. To address this knowledge gap, we designed dietary exposure experiments under laboratory conditions, using the springtail species Folsomia candida. The springtails were administered polyethylene microplastics in three different sizes (2, 34, and 66 mu m) via their food for a short period of time; we further observed the intestinal presence of microplastics via fluorescence microscopy to determine the maximum edible size. We evaluated the effects of ingested microplastics on springtails by quantifying their moving behavior. The results show that the edible size of microplastics is < 66.0 +/- 10.9 mu m, and microplastics smaller than this can significantly reduce the velocity and distance of springtail movement by 74% +/- 38% compared with the control group. Based on this finding, the broader fate and toxicity of microplastics in soil environments can be estimated. Furthermore, the average velocity and distance of springtail movement decreases in response to microplastic ingestion, highlighting the negative effects of microplastics on soil organisms.

The results showed that a 2 day exposure to both chlordane and HCH induced similar adverse effects including lethality, growth inhibition and lifespan reduction. Compared to single OCPs, their joint exposure with NPs caused stronger chronic toxicity including the reduction of body length and lifespan but weaker acute lethality. The mean lifespans of chlordane- and HCH-joint groups were significantly shortened by 16.2% and 11.8% compared to the single exposure group. Furthermore, joint exposure elevated the expression of glutathioneS-transferase-4 (gst-4), a key enzyme in oxidative stress, both in concentration- and time-dependent manners. This reflects that oxidative damage is involved in the mechanisms of joint toxicity. Altogether, this study reveals that nanoparticles can enhance the chronic toxicity of organochlorine pesticides, which suggests the high eco-environmental risk of their co-presence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

Larvae ingested significantly more ciliates containing DDT-treated microspheres than ciliates containing untreated plastics but did not discriminate when exposed directly. Larvae reared for 16 d following a direct 2 h exposure had significantly lower wet weight values than unexposed controls.

Carbonyl and vinyl indices were used to avoid counting biopolymers as plastics. Microplastics composed of variety of polymers, including polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethyleneterphthalates (PET), polyethylene-polypropylene copolymer (PEP), and polyacrylates (PAK), were identified in the sediment. We measured microplastics between 315 mu m and 5 mm, most of which were in the range 315 mu m(-1) mm. The abundance of microplastics in surface sediment varied from 100 pieces/ kg-dry sediment in a core collected in the Gulf of Thailand to 1900 pieces/ kg-dry sediment in a core collected in a canal in Tokyo Bay. A far higher stock of PE and PP composed microplastics in sediment compared with surface water samples collected in a canal in Tokyo Bay suggests that sediment is an important sink for microplastics. In dated sediment cores from Japan, microplastic pollution started in 1950s, and their abundance increased markedly toward the surface layer (i. e., 2000s). In all sediment cores from Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, and South Africa, the abundance of microplastics increased toward the surface, suggesting the global occurrence of and an increase in microplastic pollution over time.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

We critically review and evaluate recent microplastic ingestion studies in aquatic biota, propose a quality assessment method for such studies, and apply the assessment method to the reviewed studies. The quality assessment method uses ten criteria: sampling method and strategy, sample size, sample processing and storage, laboratory preparation, clean air conditions, negative controls, positive controls, target component, sample (pre)treatment, and polymer identification. The results of this quality assessment show a dire need for stricter quality assurance in microplastic ingestion studies. On average, studies score 8.0 out of 20 points for ""completeness of information"" and 0 for ""reliability"".

Samples of facility agricultural soil, open-field agricultural soil, and agricultural plastic mulch film were collected to investigate the distribution characteristics, influencing factors, and discharging sources of microplastics (MPs). Microplastic abundance of three soil layers at all sampling sites ranged from 310 to 5698 items/kg, with an average value of 1444 +/- 986 items/kg. The main size category of MPs was less than 0.5 mm, and the contribution of MPs with sizes <0.5 mm in the 10-25 cm layer of facility agricultural soils was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that in the 0-5 an soil layer, which indicated that small MPs tended to migrate to deeper soil layers. The prevailing shapes of MPs were fragment and film, while polypropylene, ethylene-propylene copolymer, and polyethylene dominated among chemical compositions. The fractions of silty and sandy particles were correlated with the abundance of MPs, and the microplastic abundance in sandy loam was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that in silty loam or loam based on the international classification standard. Thus, the soil texture may affect the distribution of MPs in local agricultural soils. In addition, the planting age of facility agricultural soil was related to microplastic abundance, while there was no significant difference in the microplastic abundances of facility agricultural soils under different irrigation methods.        Capsule: The microplastic abundance in sandy loam surpassed that in silty loam or loam, small size (<05 mm) MPs tended to migrate to deeper soil layers, and planting age affected microplastic abundance in facility agricultural soils.

Now is the time to consider the best strategic choices for the research, management and outreach needed to address priority issues around microplastics. It is essential to treat marine plastic pollution not only as an area in need of comprehensive research and waste management solutions, but also as a permanent pollutant in order to formulate management responses similar to those for other pollutants. First, it is essential to consider developing monitoring protocols to gather important baseline information about microplastics to inform management responses. Second, targeted research is needed to identify differences in microplastic accumulation among selected species and fisheries. Third, research is needed to explore potential threshold levels of microplastics in seafood that could trigger management actions or consumer advisories. Finally, a range of model management practices to address microplastics should be considered, such as regulating inputs from wastewater, assessing what consumer advisories are needed, and taking into account localized inputs from gear used in seafood harvesting and cultivation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Every week new articles are published in scientific journals. However, not all of them are original or important. Dozens of papers come out monthly that report the number of microplastic particles found in some water body, but they cannot be compared because there are no standardized methods for collection or analysis. However, it has become clear that collecting microplastics with nets misses most of the microplastics, since microfibers, which are by far the most abundant type when whole water samples are analyzed, pass through nets. These microfibers are derived primarily from synthetic clothing via wastewater from washing machines. Another common study documents that some species consumes microplastics. It seems that every animal studied eats them; it would be of greater interest to find one that does not ingest them. Although animals consume them, few studies have examined how soon and how many are egested. Most may pass through the gut without causing any noticeable effects. This is an important area to study. Microplastics are considered vectors for transferring contaminants to animals and up the food chain, but few studies demonstrate this with realistic scenarios such as providing the animals some ""real"" food and time to egest. Effects attributed to microplastics may be symptoms of inadequate nutrition or a clogged digestive tract. It is also important to learn how much of the adsorbed contaminants the gut can desorb during the time that microplastics are passing through. Future feeding studies should not use spherical microplastics which are rare in aquatic environments but should use primarily microfibers which are the predominant shape found, provide real food, and allow time for egestion to occur. Other research needs include additional studies on soil and terrestrial biota and developing ways to modify the manufacture of textiles to shed fewer microfibers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

After exposure from L1-larvae to adult day-3, nanopolystyrene at high concentrations (100 and 1000 mu g/L) reduced the lifespan. Although nanopolystyrene (1 or 10 mu g/L) did not affect the lifespan, nanopolystyrene (1 or 10 mu g/L) could induce the more severe intestinal reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and decrease in locomotion behavior during the aging process compared with control. Moreover, nanopolystyrene exposure could cause the severe decrease in expressions of some immune response genes, hsp-6 gene, and genes encoding manganese-superoxide dismutases (Mn-SODs) during aging process, suggesting the severe suppression in innate immune response, inhibition in antioxidation defense system, and suppression in mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mt UPR) by nanopolystyrene.

The goals of the study were to determine whether urban New Jersey freshwaters contained microplastic pollutants, and if so, to test analytic techniques that could potentially identify chemical compounds associated with this pollution. A third objective was to test whether identified associated compounds might have physiological effects on an aquatic organism. Using field collected microplastic samples obtained from the heavily urbanized Raritan and Passaic Rivers in New Jersey, microplastic densities, types, and sizes at 15 sampling locations were determined. Three types of plastic polymers were identified using pyrolysis coupled with gas chromatography (Pyr-GC/MS). Samples were further characterized using solid phase micro extraction coupled with headspace gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/ITMS) to identify organic compounds associated with the: (i) solid microplastic fraction, and (ii) site water fraction. Identical retention times for GC peaks found in both fractions indicated compounds can move between the two phases, potentially available for uptake by aquatic biota in the dissolved phase. Patterns of tentatively identified compounds were similar to patterns obtained in Pyr-GC/MS. Embryonic zebrafish exposed to PyCG/MS-identified pure polymers in the 1-10 ppm range exhibited altered growth and heart defects. Using two analytic methods (SPME GC/MS and Pyr-GC/MS) allows unambiguous identification of compounds associated with microplastic debris and characterization of the major plastic type(s).

This study evaluated the combined effect of temperature and polystyrene microplastics (MP) on Artemia, a filter-feeding crustacean that is widely used for environmental toxicology studies. Brine shrimp Artemia franciscana were exposed to three MP concentrations (0, 0.2, and 2.0 mg/L) and three temperatures (22, 26, and 30 degrees C) for 14 d. In general, higher MP concentration and temperature led to a decreased survival rate and growth. Two-way ANOVA analysis indicated that the survival rate of Artemia was significantly impacted by both MP concentration and temperature (P<0.05), but there was no significant interaction between two factors (P>0.05). Growth of Artemia was significantly impacted by temperature (P<0.05), and with a significant interaction between two factors (P<0.05). Furthermore, the enzymatic activity, intestinal histological analyses, and immune gene expression were determined for Artemia reared at 30 degrees C with three MP concentrations (0, 0.2, and 2.0 mg/L). The results showed that 2.0 mg/L MP resulted in reduced Artemia intestinal microvilli and exfoliated epithelia cells, significantly increased acid phosphatase (ACP) activity (P<0.05) and immune-related gene ADRA1B and CREB3 expression, revealing that higher MP concentration could induce oxidative and immunological stress on Artemia at 30 degrees C. Overall, our study suggests that MP and temperature have combined adverse effect on Artemia, especially at relatively high temperature and polystyrene MP concentration. These findings are important to understand the potential ecological risks posed by these two factors on the organisms in marine environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

S-MPs with a diameter of approximately 1 to 4 m showed a sorbic acid loading capacity of 46.5%. Addition of S-MPs (3%, w/w) increased the tensile strength, haze, oxygen, and water vapor barrier properties, as well as reduced the elongations at break and transmittance of S-MPs-EVOH (S-MP-EVOH) film. Antibacterial tests showed that the inhibitory capacity of S-MP-EVOH film against Salmonella Enteritidis and Escherichia coli was higher than that against Listeria monocytogenes. Moreover, the antibacterial effect of sorbic acid-EVOH (S-EVOH) film was stronger than that of S-MP-EVOH film. However, S-MP-EVOH film demonstrated a longer effective time than S-EVOH film. Using the total viable counts and total volatile base nitrogen as the judgment standard, S-MP-EVOH/polyethylene terephthalate (PET) composite film could extend the shelf life of fish fillets by 4 d at 4 degrees C, compared with EVOH/PET film. For this reason, S-MP could be a potential antibacterial component of active films.

Here, we perform a comprehensive assessment by examining whole digestive tracts of 50 individuals from 10 species whilst operating strict contamination controls. Microplastics were ubiquitous with particles detected in every animal examined. The relatively low number per animal (mean = 5.5) suggests these particles are transitory. Stomachs, however, were found to contain a greater number than intestines, indicating a potential site of temporary retention. The majority of particles were fibres (84%) while the remaining 16% was fragments. Particles were mainly blue and black (42.5% and 26.4%) in colour and Nylon was the most prevalent (60%) polymer type. A possible relationship was found between the cause of death category and microplastic abundance, indicating that animals that died due to infectious diseases had a slightly higher number of particles than those that died of trauma and other drivers of mortality. It is not possible, however, to draw any firm conclusions on the potential biological significance of this observation and further research is required to better understand the potential chronic effects of microplastic exposure on animal health, particularly as marine mammals are widely considered important sentinels for the implications of pollution for the marine environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Sharks were collected from the North-East Atlantic. Stomachs and digestive tracts of 46 sharks of 4 species were examined and 67% of samples contained at least one contaminant particle. Although we acknowledge modest sample size, estimated particle burden increased with body size but did not vary systematically with sex or species. A total of 379 particles were identified, leading to median estimates ranging from 2 to 7.5 ingested contaminants per animal for the 4 species. The majority were fibrous in nature (95%) and blue (88%) or black (9%) in colour. A subsample of contaminants (N=62) were subject to FT-IR spectroscopy and polymers identified as: synthetic cellulose (33.3%), polypropylene (25%), polyacrylamides (10%) and polyester (8.3%). The level of risk posed to shark species by this level of contamination is unknown.

Thus, to guarantee a proper quality of results, researchers must adopt strict contamination control measures. This review was conducted to understand current contamination control practices. A total of 50 studies published in 2019 were reviewed, including sampling of biota, air, soil, sediment, freshwater and saltwater, regarding 10 contamination control parameters. Overall, studies usually only comply with 4 out of 10 of these measures, which include avoiding the use of plastic materials, covering samples with glass lids or aluminum foil, filtering solutions, or running procedural blanks. The importance of these measures is also exemplified with real observation of contamination. Finally, seven measures to control for contamination are suggested in order to improve the quality of results in microplastic sampling in future assessments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Thus, the goal of the present study was to investigate if the presence of microplastics (1-5 mu m diameter) influences the toxicity of the pharmaceuticals procainamide and doxycycline to the marine microalga Tetraselmis chuff. Bioassays (96 h) to investigate the toxicity of those substances individually and in mixtures (i.e. microplasticsprocainamide mixtures and microplastics-doxycycline mixtures) were carried out. Effect criteria were the average specific growth rate (growth rate) and chlorophyll a concentration (chlorophyll). EC10, EC20 and EC50 were determined. Microplastics alone had no significant effects on growth rate up to 41.5 mg/l, whereas chlorophyll was significantly reduced at 0.9 and 2.1 mg/l of microplastics, but not at higher concentrations. The 96 h EC50 (growth rate and chlorophyll, respectively) determined for the other bioassays were: 104 and 143 mg/l for procainamide alone; 125 and 31 mg/l for procainamide in the presence of microplastics; 22 and 14 mg/l for doxycycline alone; 11 and 7 mg/l for doxycycline in the presence of microplastics. Significant differences (p < 0.001) between the toxicity curves of each pharmaceutical alone and in mixture with microplastics were found for procainamide (chlorophyll), and doxycycline (both parameters). Thus, both pharmaceuticals were toxic to T. chuii in the low ppm range, and microplastics-pharmaceutical mixtures were more toxic than the pharmaceuticals alone. Very high decreases of doxycycline concentrations in test media were found, indicating degradation of the antibiotic. Thus, although the biological results are expressed in relation to doxycycline concentration, the effects were likely caused by a mixture of the parental compound and its degradation products. The concentrations of microplastics and pharmaceuticals tested (low ppm range) are higher than those expected to be found in waters of the most part of marine ecosystems (ppt or ppb ranges). However, considering the widespread contamination by microplastics and pharmaceuticals, the concentrations already found in waters, sediments and/or organism of heavily polluted areas, the long-term exposure (over generations) of wild populations to such substances in polluted ecosystems and the possibilities of bioaccumulation and toxicological interactions, these findings are of concern and further research on microplastics-pharmaceuticals toxicological interactions is needed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

In 2016, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and made a call for further research testing hypotheses about ecological effects. In the subsequent years, the amount of relevant research has risen tremendously. Here, we reassess the literature to determine the current weight of evidence about the effects of plastic pollution across all levels of biological organization. Our data spans marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. We extracted data from 139 lab and field studies testing 577 independent effects across a variety of taxa and with various types, sizes, and shapes of plastic. Overall, 59% of the tested effects were detected. Of these, 58% were due to microplastics and 42% were due to macroplastics. Of the effects that were not detected, 94% were from microplastics and 6% were from macroplastics. We found evidence that whether or not an effect is detected, as well as the severity and direction of the effect, is driven by dose, particle shape, polymer type, and particle size. Based on our analyses, there is no doubt that macroplastics are causing ecological effects, however, the effects of microplastics are much more complex. We also assessed the environmental relevancy of experimental studies by comparing the doses used in each exposure to the concentrations and sizes of microplastics found in the environment. We determined that only 17% of the concentrations used in experimental studies have been found in nature, and that 80% of particle sizes used in experiments fall below the size range of the majority of environmental sampling. Based on our systematic review and meta-analysis, we make a call for future work that recognizes the complexity of microplastics and designs tests to better understand how different types, sizes, shapes, doses, and exposure durations affect wildlife. We also call for more ecologically and environmentally relevant studies, particularly in freshwater and terrestrial environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

However, the potential hazard of microplastics to aquaculture animals, especially toward lipid metabolism involved with the survival and growth of aquatic animal, has not yet been investigated. In the present study, redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus) were exposed to different concentrations of 200 nm-sized polystyrene microspheres (0, 0.5, and 5 mg/L) for 21 days, to investigate the effects of microplastics on lipid metabolism.        After ingestion, the microplastics were distributed in the intestines and hepatopancreas, and appeared to inhibit the growth of Cherax quadricarinatus. Subsequently, the lipid levels in the hepatopancreas and hemolymph was detected, and found that after 21 days of exposure, the lipid content and free fatty acids in the hepatopancreas and hemolymph decreased significantly, and total cholesterol and triglycerides levels increased significantly in the hemolymph. This might have been caused by insufficient intake of exogenous fat. A significant decrease in lipase activity also supported this view. The activity of lipoprotein lipase related to lipolysis in the hepatopancreas increased significantly, while the activity of fatty acid synthase related to fat synthesis increased, and the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase decreased. These results indicated disturbed lipid metabolism in the hepatopancreas. The significant increase of lipid transport-related low-density lipoprotein indicated that the lipolytic capacity was higher than the lipid synthesis capacity. The expression levels of fatty acid metabolism-related genes FAD6 and FABP decreased significantly, indicating that the fatty acid utilization ability of hepatopancreas cells was inhibited, which was consistent with the results of enzyme activities.        Thus, microplastics represent a potential hazard to redclaw crayfish, at least on lipid metabolism.

Organic fibers comprised microplastic and natural organic fiber particles. Inorganic fibers were mainly man-made mineral fibers (MMMFs), asbestos (represented by chrysotile), calcium sulfate and metal fiber particles. Microplastic and MMMFs fibers were most abundant, accounting for 34.6% and 403% in total, respectively, followed by asbestos (7.8%), calcium sulfate (7.2%), metal fibers (5.6%) and natural organic fiber particles (4.5%). The number-concentration of these particles was about 16.7 x 10(-3) fibers/ml at 1.5 m above the ground and about 14.1 x 10(-3) fibers/ml at about 18 m, suggesting the particles were mainly derived from surface and were re-suspended. Approximately 80% of the airborne fiber were smaller than 20 pm in length, which is possibly the critical size for fiber particles to re-suspend into the air.

Commercialized DM and MPs obtained as dry powder were used in the experiment According the manufacturer (Cospheric, Santa Barbara, CA. USA) MPs were spherical (1-4 mu m in diameter), had a density of 0.96 g/cm(-3) and were without any solvent. Three concentrations of polyethylene MPs were tested (0, 1, 10 mg/L) with two realistic concentrations of DM (0 and 40 ng/L) and a solvent control (acetone). During the 21 d experiment, D. magna neonates were individually exposed to the treatments, and the effects of MPs and DM alone and together were evaluated by assessing survival, number of cumulative molts, days to first brood, number of broods, number of neonates per surviving adult, and body length. Significant detrimental effects on survival were only observed for the two mixture treatments. DM alone (40 ng/L) delayed the days to first brood and reduced the number of neonates per surviving adult, whereas MPs alone (10 mg/L) induced significant reduction in the number of juveniles by surviving adults. The combined exposure to DM and MPs clearly had a synergistic effect on survival, brood number, and number of neonates per surviving female. For example, compared to exposure to 40 ng/L of DM alone, the addition of 1 mg/L of MPs resulted in a 51.1% reduction in number of neonates per surviving female and a 46% reduction in brood number.

Two sites on the tidal Thames were sampled; one upstream of the City of London at Putney, and the other downstream at Greenwich. Water column samples were collected from June through to October 2017, being taken on the ebb and flood tides, at the surface and a depth of 2 m. Microplastics (excluding microfibres) were identified to test whether the load varied between the two sites in relation to tide, depth and season. Secondary microplastics, films and fragments, contributed 93.5% of all those found at Putney and Greenwich. Site, tide, depth and month affected density, with the combined interaction of month and site found to have the greatest influence on microplastics. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis showed that polyethylene and polypropylene were the most common polymers collected from the River, suggesting broken down packaging was the primary source of microplastics in these samples. Excluding microfibres, the estimate of microplastics in the water column was 24.8 per m(3) at Putney and 14.2 per m(3) at Greenwich. These levels are comparable to some of the highest recorded in the world. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The study areas arc well known for the high population and high industrial activities that can contribute to the plastic pollution. In this case, microplastics were sampled from the surface sediments at four different stations representing different local activities. The microplastics were extracted by the density separation method from collected samples. Each particle was identified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Furthermore, beach litters were obtained according to the adopted methodology - guidance on monitoring of marine litter in European seas.        The obtained mean concentrations are 182.66 +/- 27.32 and 649.33 +/- 184.02 kg(-1) sediment (DW), respectively. A detailed spatial and quantitative analysis revealed that their distribution was a function of proximity to populated areas and associated with wastewater effluents, industrial installations, degree of shore exposure and complex tidal flow patterns. Five types of microplastics were identified; the most common were fibers (70%), fragments (21%), pellets (5%), films (2%) and foams (2%). Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) analysis showed that the main polymers detected in the studied microplastics were polyethylene (48%), polypropylene (16%), polyethylene terephthalate (14%), polystyrene (9%), butyl branham (7%), ethylene propylene (3%) and cellulose tri acetate (3%).        The obtained results provided a holistic view of the abundance, distribution, and characteristics of microplastics in the Gulf of Annaba.

Samples were collected in March and April 2014 along two transects located off Pellestrina Island (Venice) and the Po Delta, each consisting of four sampling stations at 0.5, 3, 10, and 20km from the shoreline. Microplastics were quantified and classified according to their colors and shapes and analyzed by micro-attenuated total reflection-FT-IR. Microplastics were found in all samples, albeit with high spatial and temporal variability. The highest concentrations were observed in March at the offshore station of the Pellestrina transect (10.4particlesm(-2)) and the two landward stations off the Po Delta (2.1 and 4.3particlesm(-2)), highlighting the influence of various factors, such as surface circulation and river discharges, in determining specific accumulation patterns. The most common polymers were polyethylene and polypropylene, and most of the particles were secondary microplastics (83.5%). The patchy distribution of microplastics observed in the study area is driven by hydrodynamic and meteorological factors acting on short time scales.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The ecological impacts associated with their presence are still poorly understood, however, these contaminants are extremely persistent. Although plastic in the environment can concentrate pollutants, factors such as the type of plastic and duration of environmental exposure as it relates to the degree of adsorption have received far less attention. To address these knowledge gaps, experiments were carried out that examined the interactions of PFAS and microplastics in the field and in a controlled environment. For field experiments, we measured the abundance of PFAS on different polymer types of microplastics that were deployed in a lake for 1 month and 3 months. Based on these results, a controlled experiment was conducted to assess the adsorption properties of microplastics in the absence of associated inorganic and organic matter. The adsorption of PFAS was much greater on the field-incubated plastic than what was observed in the laboratory with plastic and water alone, 24 to 259 times versus one-seventh to one-fourth times background levels. These results suggest that adsorption of PFAS by microplastics is greatly enhanced by the presence of inorganic and/or organic matter associated with these materials in the environment, and could present an environmental hazard for aquatic biota.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Bivalves were collected in the field and acclimated to laboratory conditions for 14 days. Then, a 14-day bioassay was carried out. Bivalves were exposed for 8 days to clean medium (control), microplastics (0.13 mg/L), mercury (30 mu g/L) and to a mixture (same concentrations) of both substances. The post-exposure recovery was investigated through 6 additional days in clean medium. After 8 and 14 days, the following endpoints were analysed: the post-exposure filtration rate (FR); the activity of cholinesterase enzymes (ChE), NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), octopine dehydrogenase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferases (GST), and the levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO). After 8 days of exposure to mercury, the bioconcentration factors (BCF) were 55 in bivalves exposed to the metal alone and 25 in bivalves exposed to the mixture. Thus, microplastics reduced the bioconcentration of mercury by C. fluminea. Bivalves exposed to microplastics, mercury or to the mixture had significantly (p <= 0.05) decreased FR and increased LPO levels, indicating fitness reduction and lipid oxidative damage. In addition, bivalves exposed to microplastics alone had significant (p <= 0.05) reduction of adductor muscle ChE activity, indicating neurotoxicity. Moreover, bivalves exposed to mercury alone had significantly (p <= 0.05) inhibited IDH activity, suggesting alterations in cellular energy production. Antagonism between microplastics and mercury in FR, ChE activity, GST activity and LPO levels was found. Six days of post-exposure recovery in clean medium was not enough to totally reverse the toxic effects induced by the substances nor to eliminate completely the mercury from the bivalve's body. These findings have implications to animal, ecosystem and human health.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",,

M. and Shashoua, Yvonne and Syberg, Kristian and Khan, Farhan R.",,,,,"The association of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) to microplastics (MPs) in the aquatic environment and the possible perturbation of how biota and HOCs interact (i.e. 'MP vector effect') is a much researched topic in the emergent field of aquatic MP pollution. Consensus on whether the vector effect is relevant can in part be ascertained using laboratory experimentation. Such studies, of which there are now many examples, have as a mandatory component a characterisation of the HOC-MP interaction. However, important considerations must be made when planning and executing such laboratory experiments, and subsequently when choosing equilibria models to fit sorption curves, as it is necessary to recognize that simplified conceptual models (i.e. Freundlich or Langmuir models) do not fit all HOC-MP interactions under all circumstances. The sorption equilibrium of HOCs to most plastic particles occurs as a combination of surface adsorption in the crystalline regions of the polymer (typically characterized by Langmuir models) and internal partition into amorphous regions (modelled with Freundlich relations), but this is rarely recognized. In this discussion we highlight some considerations needed when both characterizing the interactions between MPs and HOCs and improving the environmental realism of vector studies through the use of, for instance, weathered particles, adequate time for HOC-MP equilibria to be reached and working at lower concentrations. Increasing environmental realism of vector studies corresponds to a greater complexity in the equilibria model, but ultimately allows better understanding of any potential HOC-MP vector effect in nature.

Direct or indirect exposure to those particles leads to adverse effects on marine organisms. In the marine environment, plastic materials interact with other pollutants such as metals, thereby affecting the uptake levels of those pollutants in marine organisms. In the present study, the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum was exposed to polyethylene microbeads and mercury chloride in single, combined and incubated form at environmentally relative concentrations for one week in controlled laboratory conditions. The uptake and tissue distribution of both stressors as well as the vector role of microplastics on mercury uptake in the organisms were investigated. Filtration rates, biomarkers for immunomodulation and oxidative stress, and histological alterations were also evaluated. Microplastics were ingested by the clams, and translocated to the various tissues. However, contaminated microplastics displayed a negligible vector role in terms of mercury bioaccumulation in the clams. The single and interactive exposure of the stressors reduced the filtration rate in the clams. Both pollutants affected the immune system of the organisms. Histological alterations were determined in the gill and digestive gland tissues of the clams among the treatment groups, although oxidative stress biomarkers remained unchanged. This study suggests that the vector role of polyethylene microplastics in mercury uptake is negligible and reveals that the single and interactive one-week exposure of two pollutants induce toxicity in the manila clams.

The tragic consequence is millions of pieces of plastic polluting and harming sea life every day. The road towards a clean sea contains several legs and requires mapping of the ocean water column to determine critical areas. Determining technologies and methods for the detection of microplastics underwater are hence a necessity. Raman spectroscopy is such a technology, in principle able to extract the chemical structure of the object to be viewed by collecting spectral signatures at the point illuminated. This creates the foundation for the research presented in this paper, aiming to cover whether it is possible to classify specific types of microplastics underwater by identifying their respective spectral signatures. Raman spectroscopy has been carried out on three different cases of samples. The first case involves known plastic, ordered from CARAT AS, with the purpose of creating the foundation of a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model. The second case holds the same base but includes drops of water on top of the original sample. This case provided data for testing the prediction of the PLS-DA model. The third case includes raw plastic pieces, collected from the sea outside Svolvaer, Lofoten. The measurements of these samples create the grounds for the last test-set. The results suggest that the method can classify microplastic correctly, both in water and sea-influenced pieces. However, the specific spectra cannot vary too much as a result of industrial and environmental changes altering the condition of the plastic, and thereby the spectrum. This leaves the mapping and classification method best suited for plastics that recently entered the ocean.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

Their widespread use lead inevitably to a high contamination of environment. Previous studies focus on plastic particles regardless of their type or shape as long as they are comprised between 330 mu m and 5 mm. On the contrary, this study focuses exclusively on fibers using a smaller mesh size net (80 mu m) to sample freshwater. Moreover, all processed organic fibers are considered, irrespective to their nature. First, the short term temporal variability of the fibers in the environment was assessed. While exposing the sampling net during 1 min a coefficient of variation of approx. 45% (with n = 6) was determined. It was of only 26% (n = 6) when the exposure was of 3 min. The assessment of the distribution through the section showed a possible difference in concentrations between the middle of the water surface and the river banks which could be attributed to the intense river traffic within the Paris Megacity. The vertical variability seems negligible as turbulence and current conditions homogenize the distribution of the fibers. A monthly monitoring showed concentrations of 100.6 +/- 99.9 fibers.m(-3) in the Marne River and of: 48.5 +/- 98.5, 27.9 +/- 26.3, 27.9 +/- 40.3 and 22.1 +/- 25.3 fibers.m(-3) from the upstream to downstream points in the Seine River. Once these concentrations are converted into fluxes, it seems that the impact generated by the Paris Megacity cannot be distinguished. Investigations on the role of sedimentation and deposition on the banks are required. This study helped fill some major knowledge gaps regarding the fibers in rivers, their sampling, occurrence, spatial-temporal distribution and fluxes. It is encouraged that future studies include both synthetic and none synthetic fibers. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In the last decades a new type of particle has been introduced, microplastics (MPs). The exposure route of pollutants influences their accumulation and distribution into tissues. A pulse-chase experiment was conducted in which mussels were exposed to Hg: adsorbed onto MPs and microalgae (MA) and dissolved (WB). Mussels accumulated the same amount of Hg independently of particle, due to the Hg loading in both particles and their acceptability were similar. The highest Hg accumulation occurred in gill when the Hg exposure was through water and in digestive gland when Hg was adsorbed to particles. More than 70% of the Hg uptake through MPs was quickly eliminated due to: i) part of the cleared MPs might not really be ingested but adhered to body surfaces of mussels, ii) MPs ingested were eliminated through faeces as they are non-nutritive particles which may be rejected in stomach preventing their entry into digestive gland and iii) high affinity of Hg on surface of MPs which meant that Hg was mainly eliminated jointly to MPs. The organic nature of MA facilitates the entry of Hg into digestive gland where MA are intracellularly digested releasing the Hg adsorbed onto their surfaces. In this case, Hg may reach deeper levels by translocation of the Hg incorporated into gland towards foot and remaining tissues, a process that might occur through haemolymph. All of the Hg accumulated in WB during the exposure was internally absorbed into tissues, and later translocated from gill to gland. Although Hg elimination rate in MPs mussels was greater than in the other exposure pathways, an important amount of Hg was maintained through the depuration period, thus we cannot and should not neglect the risk of MPs as vectors for mercury.

Thus, the aim of the present study is to assess the toxicological potential of polyethylene microplastics (PE MPs) in Physalaemus cuvieri tadpoles. According to the results, tadpoles' exposure to MP PE at concentration 60 mg/L for 7 days led to mutagenic effects, which were evidenced by the increased number of abnormalities observed in nuclear erythrocytes. The small size of erythrocytes and their nuclei area, perimeter, width, length, and radius, as well as the lower nucleus/cytoplasm ratio observed in tadpoles exposed to PE MPs confirmed its cytotoxicity. External morphological changes observed in the animal models included reduced ratio between total length and mouth-cloaca distance, caudal length, ocular area, mouth area, among others. PE MPs increased the number of melanophores in the skin and pigmentation rate in the assessed areas. Finally, PE MPs were found in gills, gastrointestinal tract, liver, muscle tissues of the tail and in the blood, a fact that confirmed MP accumulation by tadpoles.

A wide range of marine organisms has been shown to ingest microplastics due to their small dimensions (less than 1 mm). This negatively affects some biological processes, such as feeding, energy reserves and reproduction. Very few studies have been performed on the effect of microplastics on sea urchin development and virtually none on adults. The aim of this work was to evaluate the uptake and distribution of fluorescent labelled polystyrene microbeads (micro-PS) in the Mediterranean sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the potential impact on circulating immune cells. Differential uptake was observed in the digestive and water vascular systems as well as in the gonads based on microbeads size (10 and 45 mu m in diameter). Treatment of sea urchins with particles of both sizes induced an increase of the total number of immune cells already after 24 h. No significant differences were observed among immune cell types. However, the ratio between red and white amoebocytes, indicative of sea urchin healthy status, increased with both particles. This effect was detectable already at 24 h upon exposure to smaller micro-PS (10 mu m). An increase of intracellular levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species was observed at 24 h upon both micro-PS exposure, whereas at later time these levels became comparable to those of controls. A significant increase of total antioxidant capacity was observed after treatment with 10 mu m micro-PS. Overall data provide the first evidence on polystyrene microbeads uptake and tissue distribution in sea urchins, indicating a stress-related impact on circulating immune cells. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Following previous observations that plastics occur widely in their prey, we used a field study of free-living Eurasian dippers (Cinclus cinclus), to test the hypotheses that (1) plastics are transferred from prey to predators in rivers, (2) plastics contained in prey are transferred by adults to altricial offspring during provisioning and (3) plastic concentrations in faecal and regurgitated pellets from dippers increase with urbanization. Plastic occurred in 50% of regurgitates (n = 74) and 45% of faecal samples (n = 92) collected non-invasively from adult and nestling dippers at 15 sites across South Wales (UK). Over 95% of particles were fibres, and concentrations in samples increased with urban land cover. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy identified multiple polymers, including polyester, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride and vinyl chloride copolymers. Although characterized by uncertainty, steady-state models using energetic data along with plastic concentration in prey and excreta suggest that around 200 plastic particles are ingested daily by dippers, but also excreted at rates that suggest transitory throughput. As some of the first evidence revealing that plastic is now being transferred through freshwater food webs, and between adult passerines and their offspring, these data emphasize the need to appraise the potential ecotoxicological consequences of increasing plastic pollution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population",,

We here used Caenorhabditis elegans to determine the function of DBL-1/TGF-beta signaling pathway in the control of response to nanopolystyrene (100 nm). In DBL-1/TGF-beta signaling pathway, exposure to 1-1000 mu g/L nanopolystyrene significantly increased the expressions of dbl-1 encoding a TGF-beta ligand, sma-6 encoding a TGF-beta receptor, sma-4 encoding a Co-Smad, and two genes (mab-31 and sma-9) encoding transcriptional factors. DBL-1 acted in the neurons to control the response to nanopolystyrene. In the neurons, the expression and the function of DBL-1 were under the control of two signaling cascades (SMOC-1-ZAG-1 and SMOC-1-ADT-2).TGF-beta receptor SMA-6 acted in the intestine to control the response to nanopolystyrene. The downstream Co-Smad/SMA-4 and two transcriptional factors (MAB-31 and SMA-9) of SMA-6 in the intestine were further identified to be required for the control of response to nanopolystyrene. In nanopolystyrene exposed nematodes, intestinal MAB-31 activated the mitochondrial Mn-SOD/SOD-3 by modulating DAF-16 activity, and intestinal SMA-9 activated the mitochondria' unfolded protein response by affecting ELT-2 activity. Therefore, the DBL-1/TGF-beta signaling pathway mediated an important neuron-intestine communication in nanopolystyrene exposed nematodes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, how floating plastic debris is transported to coastal lagoons and marine conservation units is still poorly understood. This work determined the level of contamination due to floating plastic debris in Acarai Lagoon by establishing density distribution patterns along the lagoon ecocline in the winter and summer. Four areas were chosen that followed the estuarine gradient of the lagoon (external, lower, middle, and upper), and in each area, three samples of were collected by trawling with a plankton net. The plastic debris was classified into paint fragments, hard solids, plastic filaments, and soft plastics, and the plastic debris density and surface area were determined in each sampling area. The concentrations of the plastics in the downstream and upstream areas resulted from the high density of debris that occurred during the winter due to the absence of rain and the entry of coastal waters into the lagoon. The reduced abundance and surface area of the plastics in the summer were related to the substantial output of water from the interior of the lagoon to the mouth of the lagoon due to high rainfall during this season. The absence of plastic waste management actions and developed areas at the mouth of the lagoon that were associated with the spatial and temporal fluctuations in the environmental variables favored the occurrence and high abundance of plastic debris in the water column, contaminating the entire system of Acarai State Park.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The reduced number of free silanol groups on the surface of the silane modified particle, in combination with an increased steric hindrance that prevents contact with the cells is a possible mechanism for the observed lack of toxicity.

Despite the rapid growth in the number of studies on the aquatic toxicology of MPs, controversy over the fate and biological impacts of MPs is increasingly growing mainly due to the absence of standardized laboratory bioassays. Given the complex features of MPs, such as the diversity of constituent polymers, additives, shapes and sizes, as well as continuous changes in the particle buoyancy as a result of fouling and defouling processes, it is necessary to modify conventional bioassay protocols before employing them for MP toxicity testings. Moreover, several considerations including quantification of chemicals on/in the MP particles, choice of test organisms, approaches for renewing the test solution, aggregation prevention, stock solution preparation, and units used to report MP concentration in the test solution should be taken into account. This critical review suggests some important strategies to help conduct environmentally-relevant MP bioassays. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Its threat to marine organisms has been demonstrated under laboratory conditions, yet studies on wild populations still face methodological difficulties. We reviewed the methods used to separate MP from soft animal tissues and highlighted a lack of standardised methodologies, particularly critical for synthetic microfibres. We further compared enzymatic and a potassium hydroxide (KOH)-based alkaline digestion protocols on wild crabs (Carcinus aestuarii) collected from three coastal lagoons in the north Adriatic Sea and on laboratory prepared synthetic polyester (PES) of different colour and polypropylene (PP). We compared the cost-effectiveness of the two methods, together with the potential for adverse quantitative or qualitative effects on MP that could alter the capability of the polymers to be recognised via microscopic or spectroscopic techniques. Only 5.5% of the 180 examined crabs contained MP in their gastrointestinal tracts, with a notably high quantitative variability between individuals (from 1 to 117 particles per individual). All MP found was exclusively microfibres, mainly PES, with a mean length (+/- SE) of 0.5 +/- 0.03 mm. The two digestion methods provided comparable estimates on wild crabs and did not cause any visible physical or chemical alterations on laboratory-prepared microfibres treated for up to 4 days. KOH solution was faster and cheaper compared to the enzymatic extraction, involving fewer procedural steps and therefore reducing the risk of airborne contamination. With digestion times longer than 4 days, KOH caused morphological alterations of some of the PES microfibres, which did not occur with the enzymatic digestion. This suggests that KOH is effective for the digestion of small marine invertebrates or biological samples for which shorter digestion time is required, while enzymatic extraction should be considered as alternative for larger organisms or sample sizes requiring longer digestion times.

Today, there remains no doubt that plastic debris contaminates aquatic (marine and freshwater) habitats and animals globally. The growing scientific evidence demonstrates widespread contamination from plastic debris, and researchers are beginning to understand the sources, fate, and effects of the material. As new scientific understanding breeds new questions, scientists are working to fill data gaps regarding the fate and effects of plastic debris and the mechanisms that drive these processes. In parallel, policy makers are working to mitigate this contamination. The authors focus on what is known about plastic debris that is relevant to policy by reviewing some of the weight of evidence regarding contamination, fate, and effects of the material.

The accumulation of floating MP at the sea surface is of great concern as the neustonic habitat consists of a feeding ground for primary consumers (including filter-feeders) and active predators, which makes these organisms a relevant via of MP input into the marine trophic chain. Here, a baseline evaluation of MP accumulation at the sea surface was conducted with a neuston net (335 mu m mesh) at the Arrabida coastal area, in Portugal. The study site encompasses a marine protected area and an estuary, both under strong anthropogenic pressures due to multiple activities taking place. A short-term investigation on local spatiotemporal distribution, concentration and composition of MP was performed for the first time, through the monthly collection (summer 2018 to winter 2019) of samples at 6 stations. All the neuston samples contained MP and their mean concentration was 0.45 +/- 0.52 items m(-3) (mean +/- SD). Both the averaged MP:neuston and MP:ichthyoplankton ratios were higher in December, when concentrations of organisms decreased. Temporal distribution patterns followed expected trends, as MP concentration was clearly higher in winter months due to precipitation and runoff. Although mean MP concentrations did not vary significantly between sampling stations, there was a spatial distribution of MP in relation to particle shape and size. Fragments were the most abundant shape and MP belonging to 1-2 mm size class were dominant. Amongst a diversity of 10 polymers identified by FTIR analysis, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and copolymer PP/PE were the most abundant. Potential links between local sources/activities and the different polymers were suggested. Altogether, the information provided in this study aims to raise awareness among the identified sectors and consequently to act toward the prevention of MP inputs in the region.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

However, several questions about their toxicological profile remain unanswered. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the action of SWCNT-PEG in Danio rerio zebrafish embryos at the molecular, physiological and morphological levels. The SWCNT used in this study were synthesized by the high-pressure carbon monoxide process, purified and then functionalized with distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine block copolymer-PEG (molecular weight 2kDa). The characterization process was carried out with low-resolution transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and Raman spectroscopy. Individual zebrafish embryos were exposed to the SWCNT-PEG. Toxic effects occurred only at the highest concentration tested (1ppm) and included high mortality rates, delayed hatching and decreased total larval length. For all the concentrations tested, the alkaline comet assay revealed no genotoxicity, and Raman spectroscopy measurements on the histological slices revealed no intracellular nanotubes. The results shown here demonstrate that SWCNT-PEG has low toxicity in zebrafish embryos, but more studies are needed to understand what mechanisms are involved. However, the presence of residual metals is possibly among the primary mechanisms responsible for the toxic effects observed, because the purification process was not able to remove all metal contamination, as demonstrated by the thermogravimetric analysis. More attention must be given to the toxicity of these nanomaterials before they are used in biomedical applications. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The GNPs were prepared by a citrate reduction of HAuCl4. A proper amount of melamine was applied to functionalize the GNPs. The complex reaction took place in the present of Hg2+ in the test samples, leading to the combination of Hg2+ with the C=N group of melamine located on the surface of the GNPs. This reaction resulted in damage to the stability of colloid gold, and the aggregation of GNPs occurred. Different color changes (from claret-red to lilac, purple and plum) were displayed with different concentrations of Hg2+ in the test samples. It was very easy and convenient to determine the amount of mercury ion by the naked eye. The advantages of this methodology are listed as follows: a short detecting time (within 10 min), a high specificity (no significant interference was indicated upon adding a certain amount of Cu2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Cd2+ and Fe2+), high sensitivity with a detection limit of 0.01 mg L-1, easy operation and practical on-site use.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

In the next study, antimicrobial films were prepared by incorporating nisin (100AU), cinnamon EO (0.6%), and ZnO NPs (10 mg/15 ml) into the agar-based film and tested against seven strains of L. monocytogenes. The antibacterial activity of the bio-nanocomposite was also examined on the population of pathogens which artificially are inoculated in-depth of minced fish over 12 days. Results showed that cinnamon (CEO) had the highest antimicrobial activity. The results revealed that the blend films with ZnO nanoparticles (NPs)+CEO were more effective against gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria. The strain-specific variation was noticeable for seven tested strains of L.monocytogenes. The films containing nisin and the combination of nisin with ZnO NPs and CEO significantly inhibited the growth of L.monocytogenes on the Tryptic soy agar-NaCl model (p<.05).

Larger plastic items are fragmented or eroded into smaller and smaller pieces as its moves through marine ecosystems and small particles can be fouled or flocculate into larger aggregates. Whilst physical processes play a major part in photo- and oxidative degradation of plastic debris, biological process may also contribute to the breakdown of larger plastic items into smaller particulates, yet this has not been studied well to date. Here, we demonstrate the potential for the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus to act as bioeroders of macroplastics. We found that urchins readily graze on a plastic surface, with this grazing activity generating microplastics, when held in experimental systems together. On average each urchin produced 91.7 (+/- 33.8 pieces) smaller plastic pieces (118-15,797 mu m) from one macroplastic item over a ten day period. This plastic fragmentation by the urchins grazing activity was strongly influenced by the additional availability of natural food and by the presence of fouling of the macroplastic surface. Fragmentation of macroplastic by urchins dropped by 97% when urchins were exposed to virgin plastic in the presence of natural food (kelp). However, when macroplastic was biofouled urchins acted to fragment this plastic irrespective of the presence of additional food. The majority of fragments produced were negatively buoyant due to both the biofouling process and indeed the fouling by faecal matter, sinking to the bottom of the exposure systems. This smaller size range of plastic would then bioavailable to a much wider suite of species than the original macroplastic item; hence this bioerosion process has the potential to contribute to the transfer plastic fragments through benthic food webs.

The vaccine consists of lyophilised virus surrounded by polyethylene glycol (PEG) and was extruded under low temperature. In the stomach of trout, the use of additional neutralising and adsorbing bases resulted in a neutral pH around the vaccine pellets, thus protecting the antigen against gastric acid. The in viva efficacy of this delivery method was examined in three animal challenge experiments using an attenuated VHS virus (VHSV) strain as a vaccine. After vaccination, VHSV mRNA in gut, heart, kidney, spleen and blood was amplified by semi-nested PCR after RT-PCR. Indirect immune fluorescence test detected VHS vaccine virus in the gut. The expression of MHC class II, CD4 and CD8 alpha mRNAs after oral vaccination was measured in gut using real-time RT-PCR. Antibody levels were measured by ELISA one week before vaccination and five weeks after vaccination. Animals were challenged six weeks after vaccination with highly virulent VHSV and mortality was recorded. The experiments showed that orally delivered vaccine virus was released from the vaccine preparation, penetrated the gut mucosa and led to higher expression levels of MHC class II and CD4 mRNAs when compared to control guts. VHSV antibodies were detected after oral vaccination. Immunisation with this new vaccine formulation was followed by a significant protection against VHSV. While the cumulative mortality in the non-vaccinated control group reached 70%, more than 75% of the orally vaccinated fish were protected upon challenge. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

No statistically significant differences were found in growth parameters, including final average weight, specific growth rate (SGR), weight gain (WG), and survival rate between the control and experimental groups. Acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and lysozyme (LZM) activity levels were significantly affected (increasing to similar to 1389 U/mL, 96I U/L, and 744 U/mL, respectively) when > 1.2 mg/kg Se-chitosan was added to the loach diet. The immunoglobulin M (IgM) content increased with increasing levels of Se-chitosan, and was significantly higher in the T-4 group than in the control group. Following 16S rRNA sequencing, 296 operational taxonomic units were identified across the control and T-3 groups. Alpha diversity analysis showed that species richness and diversity increased with increasing levels of Se-chitosan. Se-chitosan supplementation increased the abundance of Bactroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes, while decreasing the abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria. Thus, Se-chitosan supplementation might enhance the intestinal health of the loach, and it might therefore be useful as an immunostimulator in loach aquaculture.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention",,

This review article summarizes sources, occurrences, fate and effects/ impacts of plastics debris in coastal marine environment due to its resistance to degradation. Most plastics debris will persist in the environment for centuries and may be transported far from its sources including great distances out to sea. Land and oceans based sources are the major sources of plastics entering the environment, with domestic, industrial and fishing activities being the most important contributors. Both macro plastics and micro plastics pose a risk to organisms in the natural environment, for example, through ingestion or entanglement in the plastics. Many studies have investigated the potential uptake of hydrophobic contaminants, which can then bioaccumulate in the food chain from plastic wastes by organisms. A large numbers of marine species is known to be harmed and /or killed by plastic debris, which could jeopardize their survival, especially since many are already endangered by other forms of anthropogenic activities. Marine animals are mostly affected through entanglement in and ingestion of plastic litter. Other less known threats include the use of plastic debris by ""invader"" species and the absorption of polychlorinated biphenyls from ingested plastics. Less conspicuous forms, such as plastic pellets and ""scrubbers"" are also hazardous. To address the issue of plastic pollution in the marine environment, governments should first play an active role in addressing the issue of plastic waste by introducing legislation to control the sources of plastic debris and the use of plastic additives. In addition, plastic industries should take responsibility for the end-of-life of their products by introducing plastic recycling or upgrading programmes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

The accumulation of floating plastic in the Mediterranean Sea (between 1,000 and 3,000 tons) is likely related to the high human pressure together with the hydrodynamics of this semi-enclosed basin, with outflow mainly occurring through a deep water layer.

In addition, GOQDs exert neuroprotective effects in a neuronal cell model by decreasing apoptosis and alpha-synuclein. GOQDs also efficiently diminish ROS, apoptosis, and mitochondria' damage in zebrafish treated with M PP . Furthermore, GOQDs-pretreated zebrafish shows increased locomotive activity and Nissl bodies in the brain, confirming that GOQDs ameliorate M Pr-induced neurotoxicity, in contrast to GO nanosheets. GOQDs contribute to neurotoxic amelioration by increasing amino acid metabolism, decreasing tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, and reducing steroid biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and galactose metabolic pathway activity, which are related to antioxidation and neurotransmission. Meanwhile, H2O2 decomposition and Fenton reactions suggest the catalase-like activity of GOQDs. GOQDs can translocate into zebrafish brains and exert catalase-mimicking activity to resist oxidation in the intracellular environment. Unlike general nanomaterials, biocompatible GOQDs demonstrate their high potential for human health by reducing oxidative stress and inhibiting neurotoxicity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 3 - Intervention,1 - Type of study",,

Bacterial adherence to their surface is an early step in biofilm formation that may lead to infection, health complications, longer hospital stays, and death. Prevention of bacterial adherence and biofilm development continues to be a major healthcare challenge. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to improve the anti-microbial properties of medical devices.        Materials and Methods: Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was doped with halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), and the PDMS-HNT composite surfaces were coated with PDMS-b-polyethylene oxide (PEO) and antibacterials. The composite material properties were examined using SEM, energy dispersive spectroscopy, water contact angle measurements, tensile testing, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and thermal gravimetric analysis. The antibacterial potential of the PDMS-HNT composites was compared to commercial urinary catheters using cultures of E. coli and S. aureus. Fibrinogen adsorption studies were also performed on the PDMS-HNT-PEO composites.        Results: HNT addition increased drug load during solvent swelling without reducing material strength. The hydrophilic properties provided by PEO were maintained after HNT addition, and the composites displayed protein-repelling properties. Additionally, composites showed superiority over commercial catheters at inhibiting bacterial growth.        Conclusion: PDMS-HNT composites showed superiority regarding their efficacy at inhibiting bacterial growth, in comparison to commercial antibacterial catheters. Our data suggest that PDMS-HNT composites have potential as a coating material for anti-bacterial invasive devices and in the prevention of institutional-acquired infections.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Abstract,QUE: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 2 - Population,1 - Type of study",,

Most of the sandy beaches had more litter than wrack and both artificial and natural accumulations disclosed high spatio-temporal variability. In summer, annual and opportunistic macroalgae dominated the wrack, while the litter was mainly formed by cigarette butts and leftover food.

However, plastic litter is now found even in this remote island archipelago. Prior to this study, the sources of this plastic litter on Galapagos coastlines were unidentified. Local sources are widely expected to be small, given the limited population and environmentally conscious tourism industry. Here, we show that remote sources of plastic pollution are also fairly localised and limited to nearby fishing regions and South American and Central American coastlines, in particular northern Peru and southern Ecuador. Using virtual floating plastic particles transported in high-resolution ocean surface currents, we analysed the plastic origin and fate using pathways and connectivity between the Galapagos region and the coastlines as well as known fishery locations around the east Pacific Ocean. We also analysed how incorporation of wave-driven currents (Stokes drift) affects these pathways and connectivity. We found that only virtual particles that enter the ocean from Peru, Ecuador, and (when waves are not taken into account) Colombia can reach the Galapagos region. It takes these particles a few months to travel from their coastal sources on the American continent to the Galapagos region. The connectivity does not seem to vary substantially between El Nino and La Nina years. Identifying these sources and the timing and patterns of the transport can be useful for identifying integrated management opportunities to reduce plastic pollution from reaching the Galapagos Archipelago.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

However, plastic debris in freshwater organisms has not been well studied. The occurrence, characterization, polymer composition, and seasonal and spatial distribution of plastic debris were investigated in 9 species of wild freshwater fish from the Pearl River catchment, south China. Approximately 50% of the total fish (n = 279) belonging to 9 species were found to ingest plastic debris with an average abundance of 7.0 +/- 23.8 items/individual, indicating wide plastic contamination in the Pearl River catchment. Plastic debris were predominantly transparent or white in color, fibers or fragments in shape, and polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene-propylene copolymer (PE-PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in polymer composition. A species-specific distribution of the plastic debris was observed in terms of abundance, shape, and polymer composition. Redbelly tilapia had the highest (27.4 +/- 54.0 items/individual), whereas common carp had the lowest (0.2 +/- 0.4 items/individual) abundance of the plastic debris in their gastrointestinal tracts. Fibers of PET were predominant in the freshwater species except in barbel chubs, which had mostly PE-PP fragments. Omnivores and bottom-dwellers were more likely to ingest plastic debris. Seasonal variation was observed, with generally higher abundance of plastic debris in fish collected in the dry season than in the wet season. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:1504-1513.

Global plastic litter estimates based on field observations account only for 1% of the total volumes of plastic assumed to enter the marine ecosystem from land, raising again the question 'Where is all the plastic? '. Scant information exists on temporal trends on litter transport and litter accumulation on the deep seafloor. Here, we present the results of photographic time-series surveys indicating a strong increase in marine litter over the period of 2002-2014 at two stations of the HAUSGARTEN observatory in the Arctic (2500 m depth).        Plastic accounted for the highest proportion (47%) of litter recorded at HAUSGARTEN for the whole study period. When the most southern station was considered separately, the proportion of plastic items was even higher (65%). Increasing quantities of small plastics raise concerns about fragmentation and future microplastic contamination. Analysis of litter types and sizes indicate temporal and spatial differences in the transport pathways to the deep sea for different categories of litter. Litter densities were positively correlated with the counts of ship entering harbour at Longyearbyen, the number of active fishing vessels and extent of summer sea ice. Sea ice may act as a transport vehicle for entrained litter, being released during periods of melting. The receding sea ice coverage associated with global change has opened hitherto largely inaccessible environments to humans and the impacts of tourism, industrial activities including shipping and fisheries, all of which are potential sources of marine litter.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

With the application of CBZ in the agriculture, it has been detected in vegetables and fruits. Nowadays, it even has been detected in the watercourse and indoor dust. However, the toxic effects of CBZ on aquatic organisms have received limited attention. In this study, male adult zebrafish were exposed at 0, 30 and 100 mu g/L CBZ for 21 days to assess its effects on hepatic glycolipid metabolism. After exposure, the body weight and length decreased, but the condition factor increased significantly. Some hepatic biochemical parameters including the levels of glucose, pyruvate, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride (TG) decreased significantly in the liver of zebrafish after exposure with CBZ Two transaminases alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) also increased significantly, indicating that subchronic CBZ exposure influenced the liver function. Moreover, the relative mRNA levels of some key genes related to the glycolysis and lipid metabolism in the liver also changed significantly. Furthermore, the transcriptome analysis showed that the carbon metabolism, lipid metabolism and detoxification metabolism were also affected in the liver of CBZ exposed zebrafish. Interestingly, we also found the amounts of the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria, gamma-Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia at phylum level significantly decreased in the gut. Sequencing V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA also demonstrated gut microbiota composition changed significantly according to weighted UniFrac distance analysis. Consequently, subchronic CBZ exposure induced hepatic metabolic disorder accompanied by gut microbiota dysbiosis in adult male zebrafish. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 14,261 plastic items, appertaining to 57 litter groups, were identified along the study area at different beach zones, i.e. at low tide water level (2%), along the foreshore (6%), at high tide water level (67%) and in the backshore area (25%). Plastic items have a great floatability, being this one of the main reasons for their proportional dominance among beach litter, especially in the wrack line. Hundreds of measurements were made of different items using Raman spectroscopy, an effective technique to determine the type of plastic. Cellulose acetate represented the most abundant material (79%) linked to cigarette butts, followed by polypropylene, 9% and polyethylene, 8%. The remaining were composed by polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate and polyvinyl chloride. Smoke related items were the most common in the study area, followed by film and hard pieces, cotton bud sticks, fishing strings, food wrappers, caps,lids and single-use plastics. Beach litter can be related to beachgoers but some categories can be attributed to fishing activities or wastewater discharges. Plastics cause a multitude of damages to the coastal ecosystem, due to their toxic components and adsorbed substances and their facility of fragmentation and dispersion. Principal objective is the compositional characterization of plastic beach litter items and their spatial variability. It is therefore important to avoid unnecessary consumption, promote recycling and use other materials that are less harmful to the environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Extruded polystyrene (XPS) and expanded polystyrene (EPS), specifically, have become some of the most prominent types of marine litter found around Europe's coastlines. To combat this problem, the European Commission has ratified a series of regulations and policies, including the Single-Use Plastics Directive and the EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy. However, in order to ensure that the benefits of such regulations and policies are realized at a scale that can adequately address the scope of the problem, decision-makers will need to integrate the opinions, values, and priorities of relevant stakeholders who operate across the EPS/XPS product lifecycle. In this study, we apply a 35-statement Q-methodology to identify the priorities of stakeholders as they relate to the Irish EPS/XPS market and the wider societal transition to a circular economy. Based on the responses of nineteen individuals representing industry, policy-makers, and community leaders, we identified three distinct perspectives: System Overhaul; Incremental Upgrade; and Market Innovation. The results demonstrate that the type and format of policy interventions linked to Ireland's EPS/XPS circular economy are heavily contested, which presents significant challenges for driving the debate forward. These results provide valuable information on viewpoints that can be used by different stakeholders at national and EU levels to address areas of conflict, ultimately fostering the development of more effective, broadly supported co-developed policies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MEC: Title,QUE: Title | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

F. and Ammendolia, J. and Rochman, C. M. and Mallory, M. L.",,,,,"Plastic pollution is now recognized as a global environmental issue that can affect the health of biota and ecosystems. Now that a growing number of species and taxa are known to ingest a diverse range of sizes and types of plastics and retain the plastics in their guts, there are increasing questions relating to the movement of plastics through food webs, and how biota may directly and indirectly ingest plastics. Here, we synthesize what is known from the published, peer-reviewed literature about plastic ingestion by animals and identify critical gaps in our knowledge. We systematically reviewed and examined the literature for studies that reported ingested plastics in marine and freshwater biota at a global scale. Our objective was to inform discussions and future studies regarding what we know about plastic ingestion and fate in food webs. We assessed what regions, ecosystems, and food webs have been studied to date and whether potential information may already be available to assess if trophic transfer of plastics may be occurring. We found 160 relevant publications through 2016. Most studies were concentrated in specific regions and in specific ecosystem types, with freshwater studies being the most limited. Moreover, most studies examined one species at a time with only a handful of regions with multiple taxa examined across multiple studies. Twenty-one percent of the regions have no published data on plastic ingestion to date. Although some studies have measured ingestion in multiple species across trophic levels, few have tested the hypothesis that plastics are transferred across trophic levels. Moreover, none have addressed questions related to biomagnification. While our review suggests that numerous papers have recorded the ingestion of plastics by biota across many trophic levels, habitats, and geographic regions, many questions regarding how or whether biota retain, bioaccumulate, biomagnify, and trophically transfer plastics still need to be addressed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Querusche""=>""Excluded"", ""elisa.calcagnotto""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: QUE: Title,MEC: Abstract | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: 1 - Type of study",,

R. and Porter, Adam and Hembrow, Neil and Sharpe, Jolyon and Galloway, Tamara S. and Lewis, Ceri",,,,,"Marine litter and its accumulation on beaches is an issue of major current concern due to its significant environmental and economic impacts. Yet our understanding of spatio-temporal trends in beach litter and the drivers of these trends are currently limited by the availability of robust long term data sets. Here we present a unique data set collected systematically once a month, every month over a six year period for nine beaches along the North Coast of Cornwall, U.K. to investigate the key drivers of beach litter in the Bude, Padstow and Porthcothan areas. Overall, an average of 0.02 litter items m(-2) per month were collected during the six year study, with Bude beaches (Summerleaze, Crooklets and Widemouth) the most impacted (0.03 +/- 0.004 litter items m(-2) per month). The amount of litter collected each month decreased by 18% and 71% respectively for Padstow (Polzeath, Trevone and Harlyn) and Bude areas over the 6 years, possibly related to the regular cleaning, however litter increased by 120% despite this monthly cleaning effort on the Padstow area beaches. Importantly, at all nine beaches the litter was dominated by small, fragmented plastic pieces and rope fibres, which account for 32% and 17% of all litter items collected, respectively. The weathered nature of these plastics indicates they have been in the marine environment for an extended period of time. So, whilst classifying the original source of these plastics is not possible, it can be concluded they are not the result of recent public littering. This data highlights both the extent of the marine litter problem and that current efforts to reduce littering by beach users will only tackle a fraction of this litter. Such information is vital for developing effective management strategies for beach and marine litter at both regional and global levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Three waste categories based on the items use were considered: single-use, fishing-related and generic-use. Over 600 sampling sites, just 14% of these were litter-free. The five-years average density of seafloor litter was 79.6 items/km(2) and ranged between 46.8 in 2019 and 118.1 items/km(2) in 2015. The predominant waste type was plastic (58% of all items). Regardless of material type, single-use items were a dominant (60% of items) and widespread (79% of hauls) fraction of litter with a mean density of 48.4 items/km 2 . Fishing-related items accounted for 12% of total litter items. Percentage of dirty hauls and litter density increased with depth. Analysis of the relation density-depth indicates a progressive increase of litter density beyond depth values situated within the interval 234-477 m depending on the litter category. A significant decrease in litter density by categories was observed over the period. Patterns of spatial distribution at the higher depths (200-80 Om) resulted stable over the years. Density hotspots of fishing-related items were found where the fishing activity that uses fish aggregating devices (FADs) is practised and in the proximity of rocky banks. Single-use and generic-use objects densities were greater on the seafloor along main maritime routes than other areas. Comparisons between the percentage of hauls littered with anthropic waste from the mid-1990s against those in 2018 -19 highlighted an increase of about 10.8% and 15.3% for single-use items and fishing-related items respectively, and a decrease of 18.6% for generic-use items.
